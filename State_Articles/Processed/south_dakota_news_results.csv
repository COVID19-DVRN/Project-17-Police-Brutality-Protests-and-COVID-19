1617120010,2020-05-26 10:27:18,Man dies after video shows officer kneeling on his neck,https://www.keloland.com/top-stories/man-dies-after-video-shows-officer-kneeling-on-his-neck/,en,True,,91060,keloland.com,http://www.keloland.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A black man has died in Minneapolis police custody after video shared online from a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man’s neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect’s description in his car. “He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” Elder said in a statement. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn’t immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her “sick to her stomach” and she said it’s another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. “Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,” she said. “What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.” Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn’t breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a “need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,” and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. “If you’re sad, I get it, if you’re angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,” Frey said. “There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19.” Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers’ gun when he was shot. A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call. That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.",0.0

The death of the man identified by a family attorney as George Floyd has drawn outrage after video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck as he cried out that he couldn't breathe. Floyd had been arrested Monday outside a deli on suspicion of forgery. He died later at a hospital. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo did not identify the former officers but called them ""former employees"" with the department, CBS Minnesota reported. Earlier Tuesday, Mayor Jacob Frey said what happened was ""wrong at every level."" ""This does not reflect the values that Chief Arradondo has worked tirelessly to instill. It does not represent the training we've invested in or the measures we've taken to ensure accountability. Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" Frey said. In the video, Floyd is seen moaning and struggling, as bystanders urge officers to place him in the police car. ""Please,"" Floyd pleads. ""I can't breathe,"" he continues to moan. An officer keeps insisting he get in the car, while the man repeatedly says he can't. ""My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. ... (I need) water or something. Please. Please. I can't breathe, officer. I cannot breathe. I cannot breathe."" A bystander later said it appeared Floyd wasn't moving. Family demands justice for George Floyd as hundreds protest in Minneapolis The attorney representing Floyd's family, Benjamin Crump, had earlier in the day called for the officers to be fired. Crump called on the Hennepin County Attorney, Michael Freeman, to charge the officers with murder. ""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck,"" Crump said in a statement. ""This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge."" Arradondo said the FBI is investigating whether civil rights charges are appropriate. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is also investigating. In a statement, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office said it is working with federal prosecutors and that they will review the findings of the investigations to make a prosecution decision. ""We promise a thorough, expedited review consistent with our on-going commitment to justice,"" the county attorney's office said in a statement. ""Every person is entitled to fairness; no person stands above the law."" Later in the day, several hundred people gathered to protest around the bus stop where Floyd was arrested. Police originally said Floyd was resisting arrest, but a new video obtained by CBS News shows what appears to be the start of the confrontation between Floyd and police. The video from a restaurant security camera shows officers taking Floyd into custody, but the restaurant's owner said it does not show Floyd resisting arrest. ""From what I saw, it didn't look like he was resisting at all,"" said restaurant owner Rashad West. Jeff Pegues contributed to this report.",0.0

George Floyd, who was black, repeatedly told a white police officer kneeling on his neck that he couldn't breathe. But despite Floyd's pleas for his life, the officer didn't let up for more than seven minutes, and Floyd died hours later. The incident was caught on video by an onlooker. The case is drawing comparisons to the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in a 2014 confrontation in the New York City borough of Staten Island after being placed in a chokehold by police. People gathered on the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was arrested for suspicion of forgery outside a deli. After he was taken into custody and the incident that followed, the 46-year-old was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, according to CBS Minnesota. Four police officers were fired Tuesday for their roles in the incident. The FBI is taking part in the investigation. Protesters marched roughly two miles from the site of the arrest to the Minneapolis Police's 3rd Precinct building. According to CBS Minnesota, officers dressed in riot gear formed a barrier around the precinct, and videos show them using smoke bombs or tear gas, as well as flash grenades, against the demonstrators.

What began peacefully soon turned confrontational, with police in riot gear firing tear gas, and some protesters throwing rocks. The protests come after a 10-minute video surfaced of police trying to detain Floyd Monday as they responded to a report of suspected forgery. A white police officer knelt on Floyd's neck for more than seven minutes, as the 46-year-old, with his hands cuffed behind his back, pleaded for help and repeatedly said ""I can't breathe"" before his body went still. All four responding officers have now been fired from the force. But, Floyd's family says they want the officers charged. His brothers Rodney and Philonise Floyd and cousin Tera Brown, who are in Houston, said they don't believe that he was resisting the officers. ""You have eyes, I have eyes. You don't need to believe what they say. You can see what you saw and I saw, and the whole nation saw, the country saw, and every person, black person in America saw the same thing because it don't happen to nobody else,"" Rodney Floyd told CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues. Police claimed George Floyd was a suspect in a forgery case at a deli and that he had physically resisted officers. But new surveillance video obtained by CBS News from a store nearby shows officers calmly detaining him. ""He was handcuffed long before they took him to that car, and you can see his demeanor from the security video. They did not have to use this excessive lethal force that killed George Floyd. They did not have to do it,"" said attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing his family. ""And that's why simply terminating them is not enough because black lives matter."" Brown agreed that firing the officers was not enough. ""We need to see justice happen. In this case, this was clearly murder. We want to see them arrested. We want to see them charged. We want to see them convicted for what they did. He did not deserve what happened to him,"" she said. ""I don't want the protests to just be for show. I want to see action. I want to see these people pay for what they did. We need to hold them accountable."" Philonise Floyd wiped away tears while speaking with Pegues. ""Just thinking just how amazing my brother was. He never did anything to nobody. Everybody loved my brother. I just don't understand why people want to hurt people, kill people. They didn't have to do that to my brother,"" he said. ""Hearing him holler over and over, he can't breathe, he can't breathe. Nobody don't want to hear that."" According to the Minneapolis police training manual, neck restraints are only allowed when a suspect is actively resisting officers and it is only allowed as a non-deadly hold if it does not block the suspect's airway.",0.0

PAUL — Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday, May 27, called on the Hennepin County Attorney's Office to arrest and charge the officer who, during a police stop Monday night, knelt on the neck of George Floyd, who died soon after. At a news conference, Frey said after seeing a bystander's cellphone video of the incident — during which the officer is seen kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes, and Floyd is heard saying he was unable to breathe — he ""can't see coming to a different answer"" than charging the officer. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" Frey said. ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" The Hennepin County Attorney's Office responded later Wednesday saying they are aware of Frey's recommendation and that they are working with investigators to review the evidence. They said Floyd's case ""deserves the best we can give and that's what this office will do."" Thousands took to the streets near the site where Floyd was killed Tuesday night to protest the Minneapolis Police Department and to honor Floyd's life. At times, protesters threw rocks at police officers and broke windows of the police precinct building and squad cars. Officers responded by throwing chemical irritants and shooting rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Demonstrators returned to the spot in Minneapolis' Powderhorn neighborhood Wednesday, prompting calls from local police and state officials to maintain safe practices during the demonstration. In a Wednesday statement, the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training called the video ""troubling and disturbing,"" and said the officer's tactic ""do not appear to reflect the training that students receive"" in police training. Following the police encounter, Floyd was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center and pronounced dead. The Minneapolis Fire Department on Wednesday made public an incident report from the Monday evening encounter. According to the report, responders spoke to an off-duty firefighter who witnessed the incident, during which Floyd went “from struggling to unresponsive on the ground while handcuffed and subdued by PD.” MFD reported that while in the ambulance, Floyd was unresponsive and had no pulse. Medics reportedly put Floyd on a ventilator and IV, and “delivered one shock by their monitor.” His pulse never returned. The four officers who were present at the scene — Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng — have all been fired from the police department. The incident has garnered national attention from activists and politicians alike. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump in a tweet called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic,"" and said the FBI and Department of Justice ""are already well into an investigation,"" which he has asked to be expedited. Also on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted, ""The police officer who killed George Floyd should be charged with murder."" Gov. Tim Walz and state public safety officials on Wednesday called on witnesses to come forward to hasten the speed of an ongoing investigation into the death. An autopsy had not yet been conducted as of Wednesday, they said. ""We know the public and the community and all of you want to know what happened that fateful day,"" Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said. ""It will be an investigation that is done right. This will not be an investigation that we cut any corners."" Harrington, Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Attorney General Keith Ellison said they were shocked by video footage depicting Floyd's killing and said the state has work to do in eliminating inequities for communities of color. And they said they wouldn't comment on what steps investigators or prosecutors should take to avoid tainting the process. ""We're not going to pre-judge the facts though the video is so clear before our eyes,"" Ellison said. ""At the end of this process, we want nobody to be able to question the process."" Words of caution as protests persist State officials and local law enforcement officers on Wednesday issued words of caution to demonstrators in Minneapolis as they again took to the streets to protest Minneapolis police response to the incident. In a statement, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said demonstrators near the Third Precinct had destroyed property and warned them against further destruction. ""I'm urging those who are gathering to please do so peacefully,"" he said. ""Criminal behavior will not be tolerated."" Frey said at Wednesday's news conference that he commends ""the 99% of protesters that were there last night doing so in a peaceful manner,"" and that they can get ""lumped in"" with those who become violent. But ""those rights (to protest), they must stop when others' public safety are put at risk."" State public safety and health officials also urged protesters to social distance and wear masks to limit the potential transmission of COVID-19 (most protesters Tuesday night were wearing masks, and free masks were handed out by organizers). And they urged demonstrators as well as law enforcement officers to avoid conflict where possible. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said the use of chemical irritants by police officers could cause additional problems with the illness. ""Anything that serves to further exacerbate respiratory illnesses when we're dealing with a virus is certainly something to be watched,"" Malcolm said. A push for transparency, policy change Several Minnesota lawmakers late Tuesday called for independent oversight of investigations into Floyd's death and urged changes in policies that could prevent instances of deadly force encounters in the future. ""While we understand that the facts are still coming to light and that state and local authorities are reviewing the case, we believe that the seriousness of the incident requires additional independent oversight by law enforcement at all levels,"" Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith along with U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Betty McCollum, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. ""We urge you to ensure that all evidence is quickly secured, including all video footage, and to aggressively pursue justice."" Members of the state Legislature's People of Color and Indigenous Caucus on Tuesday called for a full and transparent investigation of Floyd's death and for murder charges to be brought against the officers involved. And they asked that the Republican-led Senate take up legislation that would create a police accountability system, provide counseling to police officers and extend the statute of limitations for wrongful deaths brought on by police officers. ""We fear police brutality has become a de facto accepted policy outcome for Minnesota,"" the 19 lawmakers said in a news release. ""We will continue our efforts to create state laws that bring accountability, greater humanity, and community-centered public safety — all with race equity — towards ending the unacceptable killings of people of color and Indigenous people at the hands of our law enforcement entities."" Theres something u can do right now Mr Sen Majority Leader!

For the second straight night, largely peaceful protests over the death of a man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent Wednesday. A man was shot to death. The mayor's office asked that the National Guard be called in. And numerous fires were set, punctuating the gravity of the situation against the overnight darkness. The protests followed the death Monday night of George Floyd. A police officer was seen in bystander video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd was heard pleading with the officer, telling him he couldn't breathe. He later died at a hospital. On Wednesday, peaceful demonstrations grew ugly as the hours wore on, marked by confrontations between police in riot gear and protesters. Demonstrators again surrounded the Minneapolis Police 3rd Precinct building. Officers began firing tear gas and rubber bullets around 6 p.m., CBS Minnesota reports. Video posted on social media showed protesters breaking windows of the 3rd Precinct building. .@MinneapolisPD use tear gas to break up the crowd at E Lake St. & Minnehaha in front of the 3rd Precinct.

Police said they were called to the scene of a possible stabbing at 9:12 p.m. It turned out a man had been shot. He later died in a hospital. A suspect was in custody, CBS Minnesota said. It wasn't clear what led to the shooting. Around 7 p.m., dozens of people started looting a Target store near the precinct, the station said. An AutoZone was set on fire. St. Paul police sent about 40 officers to help protect Minneapolis firefighters as they worked. Other stores were looted and other blazes set.

Protesters also went to what they believed to be the suburban home of Derek Chauvin, the officer seen in the video with his knee on Floyd's neck. Chauvin and the three other officers involved in the incident have been fired. Frey is calling for charges against Chauvin. That decision will be made by Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who has said he would review the findings of an investigation by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension before making a charging decision, promising an ""expedited"" process. Demonstrators went to his home as well Wednesday night. The Associated Press says there was no violence reported at either home. Floyd's death is being probed by the FBI, the Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. President Trump tweeted Wednesday evening that he'd asked the FBI and Justice deaprtment to expedite the investigation, adding, ""Justice will be served!"" Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday, writing, ""Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy."" In Los Angeles, protesters gathered in front of City Hall and blocked traffic on the 101 freeway, CBS Los Angeles reports. One demonstrator appeared to be injured when a police car he was standing on began to drive away and he fell off. The protest was largely peaceful, and many could be seen wearing face masks due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But some demonstrators were seen breaking the windows of police cars. The Los Angeles Police Department took to Twitter Wednesday night, saying, ""Earlier we saw people on the streets of Downtown L.A., at times going onto the 101 freeway, to protest the death of George Floyd,"" the tweet read. ""We hear your anger & your pain. We will always facilitate freedom of speech. Period. All we ask is that protests are held in a safe & legal manner."" In Memphis, demonstrators gathered in front of the Midtown police precinct Wednesday evening, reports the CBS affiliate there, WREG-TV. It started with when 20-30 people began a silent protest over Floyd's death. They were lined up along Union Avenue until a small group of counter-protesters showed up across the street. Both sides began yelling at the other and tensions rose. Police stepped in, shutting down Union and allowing both sides to protest without coming in contact with each other.

Police deployed chemical irritant gas as some protesters threw rocks at the nearby 3rd Precinct police headquarters. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Tuesday night’s chaos and violence, Gov. Tim Walz weighed in on Twitter, asking people to protest peacefully. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did the same, telling a CNN interviewer just before 9 p.m., “I’m imploring our city, I’m imploring our community. This is on all of us — our police officers, our community, all of us right now — to keep the peace.” But the violence boiled over again Wednesday night. On the scene, MPR News reporter Matt Sepic said looters had cleaned out and badly damaged the nearby Target and then turned to a nearby liquor store and a nearby auto parts store. Police were shooting marking rounds at some demonstrators, trying to identify some of the people who have been vandalizing the building or throwing objects at police, Sepic added. The chaos erupted again a day after after four Minneapolis police officers were fired in the wake of a video showing a white Minneapolis police officer with his knee on Floyd's neck Monday night. Handcuffed and face down, Floyd told the officer he couldn't breathe. He later died. The video sparked waves of outrage here and across the county. Earlier in the day, Frey had called for the officer to be prosecuted as he and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged peaceful protests. By 9:30 p.m., Arradondo told Fox 9 News that while the vast majority of protesters were peaceful, there was looting happening as well as “significant property damage” and the “creation of Molotov cocktails.” Protests, he said, “cannot be at the cost of others’ personal safety. We cannot have that.” Minneapolis City Councilman Jeremiah Ellison Wednesday evening said he's disappointed by the police response to protests. In his interview with MPR News, he said the city's strategy for containing violence and protecting the community has failed. ""We always do this — we create a barrier, put the police out there, put them in a line, put face masks, depersonalize them, make them look as scary as possible and we always get this result, and then we want to point the finger at community members,” Ellison said. Tyrone Terrill, president of the African American Leadership Council, also asked demonstrators earlier in the day to refrain from violence “because destroying property or getting innocent people hurt is not what we want and it takes away from Mr. Floyd.""",0.0

(Jeff Wheeler/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A man was shot to death as violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked Minneapolis for a second straight night, with protesters looting stores near a police precinct and setting fires that continued to burn Thursday morning. Police said they were investigating Wednesday night’s death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Multiple fires burned early Thursday at buildings and smoke hung over the city. Fire crews worked to put out flames. Blocks of buildings with broken-out windows and other damage from looting were seen, and KSTP-TV reported that some people were seen going through buildings. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweetedfor calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday.",0.0

Tim Walz called in the National Guard as a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence Thursday, one day after rioting over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of George Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices downtown. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs planned to close early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service “out of concern for the safety of riders and employees,” a statement said. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread to a Target store several miles away in the Midway neighborhood of St. Paul, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store and attempted to take merchandise. St. Paul police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but looting then spread to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement, and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said. By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police’s 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night’s protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. The next day, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country. The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.",0.0

Download the CBS News app, visit cbsnews.com/minnesota or watch in the player above. The mayor of Minneapolis made an emotional plea for peace Thursday after the second night of protests that turned violent over the death of an unarmed black man in police custody Monday. George Floyd was seen in a disturbing video moaning and crying that he couldn't breathe as a Minneapolis officer continuously pressed his knee into the handcuffed man's neck. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The death sparked widespread outrage, demonstrations and calls for the officer to be charged. In Minneapolis Wednesday night, protests turned violent, with some protesters looting, setting fires and breaking windows. Violence flared up again the following night. At a press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the protests stemmed from built-up anger and sadness ""ingrained in our black community not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years."" He said feeling anger and sadness is ""not only understandable, it's right — it's a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived."" Frey appeared to be holding back tears as he said, ""I believe in Minneapolis … I love Minneapolis."" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey CBS Minnesota ""And In believing in our city, we must believe we can be better than we have been,"" he said. ""We must confront our shortcomings with both humility and hope. We must restore the peace so we can do this hard work together."" Frey said an ""all out effort"" will be implemented in the coming days to restore peace in the city, including calling in resources from the state and other jurisdictions and setting up a ""unified command structure"" to aid coordination between the agencies. Later Thursday, Governor Tim Walz activated the National Guard after the protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz said in a statement. ""George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,"" Walz added. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he understood the anger and frustration, but that as chief he can't allow criminal acts. He said the violence ""compounds the trauma that already exists"" in the community. Arradondo said the large majority of the crowd protested peacefully, but a smaller group he believed were not from Minneapolis were behind the majority of the unrest. Wednesday night, officers began firing tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators who had surrounded the Minneapolis Police 3rd Precinct building, some of whom broke windows, CBS Minnesota reported. ""I can't breathe!"": Minneapolis man dies after police confrontation Arrandondo said the police response ""shifted"" when protesters began setting fires, which required officers to redirect resources to protect responding firefighters. Some protesters also went to what they believed to be the suburban home of Derek Chauvin, the officer seen in the video with his knee on Floyd's neck. Chauvin and the three other officers involved in the incident have been fired. The mayor is calling for criminal charges against Chauvin. That decision will be made by Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who has said he would review the findings of an investigation by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension before making a charging decision.

(KELO) — The death of George Floyd, and protests in Minneapolis — some peaceful, some violent — continue to shine a spotlight on the racial divide in America. Cell phone video shows Floyd, an unarmed black man, on the ground. A police officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck, even though Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis Police Department fired that officer, Derek Chauvin, and three others involved. Family and friends want justice for George Floyd. “He stood up for people, he was there for people when they were down, he loved people that were thrown away,” Courteney Ross said. “We prayed over every meal, we prayed if we were having a hard time, we prayed if we were having a good time.” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has activated the National Guard after another night of violent clashes. Malls and public transportation shut down as some Minneapolis businesses boarded up windows, bracing for a third night. However, the director of the South Dakota African American History Museum says there is a bigger picture. Social media users quickly shared video of the incident, but Laura Renee Chandler still hasn’t watched it. “I’ve seen it one too many times, and so have many other people of color. I want people to understand black and brown people are going through something very terrifying,” Chandler said. Chandler has a Ph.D. in African American History. She says what happened in Minneapolis shows people of color can have a different perspective when it comes to experiences with law enforcement. “That’s not to say everyone — (not) to paint everyone with a broad brush or to say all members of law enforcement are bad people. That’s not what we’re saying. We’re talking about how likely is it for individuals to have this experience,” Chandler said. There are groups who are peacefully protesting Floyd’s death, but other groups have taken to violence and are destroying area businesses. “This is not to justify anything, but to have perspective on where people are coming from. They riot because they feel unheard. They feel silenced. They feel powerless. They feel no other resource is available to them,” Chandler said. Chandler hopes what’s happening here leads to a deeper conversation and more empathy about race relations in America. “African Americans have said for years this is happening in our communities. This is part of our lived reality. I want people to understand that being an ally and being supportive means you can’t just be there when it’s on video,” Chandler said. The Minneapolis mayor is calling for Derek Chauvin to face criminal charges. Minneapolis news reports show the 19-year department veteran has had at least a dozen police conduct complaints that resulted in no disciplinary action and one that led to a “letter of reprimand.” He was awarded the department’s Medal of Valor for his service in 2009.",0.0

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office has not yet released a cause of manner of death for Floyd. The determination could take at least three weeks, a spokeswoman told CBS News.  Four officers who responded have been fired, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced Tuesday. The former officers have been identified as Derek Chavin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he had relayed the call for charges in Floyd's death to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. Freeman had earlier said he would review the findings of an investigation by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension before making a charging decision, promising an ""expedited"" process. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed handcuffed black man,"" Frey said Wednesday. ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal this kind of force was necessary."" Frey did not specify which charge he is calling for. He said that for the past 36 hours he had been grappling with the question, ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?"" He said he couldn't answer the question, and because of that, he felt the need to speak out and call for justice. ""If I had done it, or if you had done it, we would be behind bars right now,"" Frey said. National Guard activated in Minneapolis after unrest Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard on Thursday ""to help protect Minnesotans' safety and maintain peace"" amid protests in the area. The executive order also activates the State Emergency Operations Center. ""Unfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property,"" the executive order said. ""These activities threaten the safety of lawful demonstrators and other Minnesotans, and both first responders and demonstrators have already been injured. Many businesses, including businesses owned by people of color, have suffered damage as a result of this unlawful activity.""

Download the CBS News app or visit cbsnews.com/minnesota to watch. Washington — President Trump on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis ""thugs"" and vowed that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" He tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. The tweet was quickly flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump said, ""I feel very, very badly"" about George Floyd's death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. ""That's a very shocking sight."" The president's language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis Thursday night. ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen,"" he tweeted. ""Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter quickly tagged the post, saying, ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" It still is. On Friday morning, the White House Twitter account retweeted it. Twitter added the same tag to that one, too. The Trump tweet and reaction from Twitter came after the president signed an executive order Thursday taking aim at the legal shield that protects social media companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms. That happened after a first-ever fact check by Twitter on his tweets this week. Social media companies call President Trump's executive order a threat to internet freedom The quote the president tweeted — ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — was said by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley during a December 1967 news conference, according to The Washington Post. Miami had a long history of aggressive policing. The Post said that quote was cited by a national commission as a contributing factor in rioting that broke out in the mostly black Liberty City section of Miami in August 1968. An accompanying tweet from Mr. Trump sharply criticized Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: ""I can't stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right....."" The National Guard had already been called in at the time. At an overnight news conference, Frey didn't appear to be aware of the Trump tweets. He asked reporters to read them to him. As they did, he shook his head. Then he said, the anger clearly audible in his voice, ""Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis. Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you'd better be damned sure that we're gonna get through this."" Trump, backers' new approach Mr. Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer's conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists see election-year political calculations. ""This is the first race-tinged case that I've ever heard him address"" as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who's known the president for decades. ""So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it's empty words because it is so out of character."" Mr. Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. ""This is something that is a local matter and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,"" then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the time. He's never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. But Mr. Trump's in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. ""You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,"" he told reporters this month. ""It's a heartbreaking thing."" The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying, ""It could be something that we didn't see on tape."" Mr. Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd. Mr. Trump ""was very upset when he saw that video,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. ""He wants justice to be served."" -- Brian Dakss contributed to this reporting.",0.0

Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with murder, and crowds broke overnight curfews imposed to try to stem violent protests over police killings of African Americans that have spread to cities across the U.S. On Minneapolis’ south side, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores, including some near a police station. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to “provide support in the south.” Protests nationwidehave been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

A CNN crew reporting on the unrest in Minneapolis was arrested by state police officers while on live television, despite identifying themselves as reporters. The city was plunged into turmoil for a third night of protests in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed while in police custody. The crew was released later Friday morning. Footage from CNN morning program ""New Day"" shows CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez reporting early in the morning, and then being approached by Minneapolis State Patrol.

However, footage shows that Jimenez and the crew informed the officers that they were reporters, and attempting to get out of the way. ""We can move back to where you'd like here. We are live on the air at the moment,"" Jimenez is heard saying to police officers approaching him in riot gear. ""Wherever you'd want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" Two police officers are shown grabbing Jimenez's arms and informing him that he is under arrest. ""Okay. Do you mind telling me why I am under arrest, sir?"" Jimenez asks as the officers pull his arms behind his back to handcuff him. Another member of the CNN crew is heard informing the officers that they are live on television. Jimenez's producer, Bill Kirkos, and the cameraperson, Leonel Mendez, were then arrested. CNN reporter Josh Campbell, who was also on the ground in Minneapolis in a different part of the city, told ""New Day"" anchors John Berman and Alisyn Camerota that he had the ""opposite"" experience of Jimenez.

He expressed shock that the police arrested Jimenez and his crew after they identified themselves and informed the officers that they were reporting live. Campbell is white, and Jimenez is black. CNN later reported that CNN president Jeff Zucker spoke to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who said he ""deeply apologizes"" for the arrest of Jimenez and his crew.

Jimenez also said that while it was a shocking experience, he was comforted that it occurred on live TV. ""The one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV,"" Jimenez said, explaining that this allowed others to speak out on his behalf. Minnesota State Patrol confirmed the arrests in a tweet. ""In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media,"" the tweet said. Jimenez and his crew had identified themselves as media while being arrested. The arrest of Jimenez and the CNN crew comes after President Trump waded into the controversy to condemn the protesters and seemingly advocate for violence.

Download the CBS News app or visit cbsnews.com/minnesota to watch. Protesters in Minneapolis set fire to the police station where the four officers who were fired after George Floyd's death worked on the third night of increasingly violent protests, Jeff Pegues reports. Other businesses in the area were attacked and looted, even after Minnesota's governor activated the National Guard. The third precinct is in smoldering remains Friday morning after protesters descended on the building just after 10 p.m., fanning flames and breaking windows. No firefighters arrived overnight to put the fire out. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey ordered police to abandon the third precinct, which has been a focus of anger since the unrest began, as hundreds and then thousands of people gathered around the site. Some were throwing rocks and lighting fireworks. Others threw wood and other debris, feeding the fire which burned for hours. Frey defended his decision to let the precinct burn. ""The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, our officers or the public,"" he said. ""Brick and mortar is not as important as life."" At the heart of the increasing anger is a lack of charges against the four police officers involved in Floyd' death. Floyd's arrest was captured in a video now seen by millions around the world, sparking global outrage. It shows Floyd, who is black, laying on the ground with white Officer Derek Chauvin's knee pinning him to the ground as he begged, ""I can't breathe."" Minneapolis police say Chauvin has had 18 complaints against him in his career, but has only faced discipline for two. Bystanders can be heard in the background imploring Chauvin to get up or for one of the other officers to stop it, but it continued for minutes until Floyd was visibly still. Hennepin County attorney Michael Freeman called Floyd's death ""senseless,"" but said he would not rush the state's investigation. ""I'm not questioning whether it was excessive, it was. I just have to prove whether it was criminal,"" Freeman said in a press conference. Earlier protests outside a Target store in nearby St. Paul destroyed the windows of a police vehicle and used shopping carts as weapons, forcing customers inside to evacuate. Longtime community activist Spike Moss has called for calm and agreed violence does not help, but acknowledged that this is the result of a community without answers. ""It lets you know they are tired,"" Moss said. ""They're tired of being oppressed, being misused, being abused, being murdered at will."" Lexxie Erdahl, who drove an hour to stand with protesters, said she understood the community's outrage. ""I think it sends a message, something as a white person I couldn't fully put into words,"" she said. ""If their only means of a message is this, then I stand with them.""",0.0
1620118590,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://listen.sdpb.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,116405,sdpb.org,http://sdpb.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.""

The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges.

Journal",http://www.argusleader.com/news/business-journal/,"MINNEAPOLIS – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.""

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said.

(Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family) ""For nine minutes and 27 seconds, my nephew begged for his life.” Selwyn Jones’ nephew, George Floyd, died in police custody Monday in Minneapolis after an officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes while Floyd laid handcuffed on the street. A bystander video shows that Floyd yelled out multiple times that he couldn’t breathe, and the footage sparked national protest, including a demonstration set in Rapid City which Jones plans to attend this weekend. The four officers involved in the case have been fired as the incident remains under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement. Derek Chauvin, the officer shown in the video kneeling on Floyd's neck, was charged Friday with third degree murder. “It’s pretty bad when you wake up and see (that) video in the news,” said Jones, a 54-year-old man from Gettysburg, South Dakota. “I’m thinking, 'Wow, not again.' Then my wife looks at me and says, 'You know who that is?'” Selwyn Jones is the uncle of George Floyd. He lives in Gettysburg South Dakota. (Photo: Submitted) As he continued to watch the video, Jones realized his nephew was the man under the officer’s knee crying for help. “The thing that disturbs me the most is hearing him call for my sister,” Jones said. “He starts calling for my sister and (his) mama because he probably knew that he was going to go away.” ‘He was always smiling’ Jones said he wants people to remember his nephew Floyd as a kind, gentle man who loved basketball and bodybuilding. “He always had a smile on his face,” Jones said. “He was always smiling and laughing.” Floyd, 46, had three children, Jones said, one of whom was a 6-year-old daughter still living in Houston with her mother. He moved from Houston to Minneapolis in 2014 to get “a change of direction in life to grow,” Jones said. Floyd was a star football player in high school, earning the nickname “gentle giant” for his 6’7 stature and his love for bodybuilding. Floyd also earned a basketball scholarship to a community college in Florida and went on to play on a club team known as To God Be The Glory Sports. More: George Floyd protests erupt across nation Floyd worked five years as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis and lost his job during Minnesota’s stay-home order. He also drove trucks and briefly worked security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. Jones lived in Rapid City for 20 years before moving to Gettysburg three years ago where he owns a motel. He said he was very close with Floyd and visited him in Minneapolis very often. Jones’s birthday was May 22, and he remembers Floyd texted him to wish him a happy birthday, the last communication they shared together. “George would have given the shirt off of his back” for anyone, Jones said. ‘He didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street’ Jones said it was hard to watch the officer in the video continue to roll his knee on Floyd’s throat. “That’s absolutely horrifying to see someone that’s loved get put into that situation,” Jones said. The video has millions of views, and that’s “millions of people who have seen my nephew get murdered in the streets of Minneapolis, for what reason?” Before moving to South Dakota, Jones grew up in a small town in North Carolina where he said he was used to seeing racism. “We’ve never seen a video of his caliber from start to finish,” Jones said. “He went unconscious because somebody felt some kind of power and control” over Floyd, Jones said. Jones said he is grateful for Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old who posted the video because without her, “none of this would have ever been known.” He said she just happened to be at a nearby bus stop and stayed close to Floyd filming the incident. “I talked to her last night and she said, ‘I can’t sleep.’ I can’t sleep, either. She said, ‘That’s all I can see. I can see your nephew begging, crying and dying at the same time. That’s all I can see: his face,’” Jones said. “Without her, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. She’s an angel. She is my hero right now.” Jones pointed to news reports that state Chauvin has had a history of use-of-force incidents over his career, including involvement as one of five officers placed on leave after they shot and wounded an indigenous man in 2011. “Doesn’t it disgust you to see someone put their knee around another human being’s neck, put their hand in their pocket and pose for the camera while he’s murdering somebody in broad daylight for everyone in the world to see?” Jones said. Mayor Jacob Frey called for Chauvin to be charged Wednesday, making no mention of the other three officers on-scene. “Maybe something will come from this that people stand up and see that this just isn’t right,” Jones said. “To watch my baby nephew suffer like an animal until they put him out of his misery … he didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street like trash.” Before Chauvin was arrested, Jones said, “I will be at every hearing, every trial, because I’m going to see this one through. I am going to be there when they’re sentenced so I can look them in the eye.” If they do receive jail time, the amount of time they receive “is going to absolutely mean nothing to me, his kids, his nephews, his nieces, his sisters, his brother, because we don’t get to see him and his big smile anymore.” Demonstrations set for Rapid City Jones said many people who are heartfelt about the issue who are rioting in Minneapolis and across the country about Floyd’s death are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones said. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones said he plans to attend a walk in memory of his nephew in Rapid City this weekend, which he said should remain peaceful. The demonstration in Rapid City was first planned by a group of organizers including Shaylene Cordero, Bec Thompson and Jodi Prue, who reached out to him recently to ask if he would join. “She’s an angel,” Jones said of Prue “We need more people like this in the world.” The walk is set for 3 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Park. Jones said he also hopes to schedule a walk in Sioux Falls. Jones said funeral arrangements for Floyd are not yet finalized, but it will likely be closer to family in Houston, Texas. “I don’t know if this will ever change,” Jones said. But as stories of Floyd’s life gain more attention and more demonstrations take place, “I think we have an opportunity to get our word out a little bit farther than ever before.” Read or Share this story: https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2020/05/29/george-floyds-uncle-speaks-out-my-nephew-begged-his-life/5282609002/",0.0

Derek Chauvin, the officer shown in the video kneeling on Floyd's neck, was charged Friday with third degree murder. “It’s pretty bad when you wake up and see (that) video in the news,” said Jones, a 54-year-old man from Gettysburg, South Dakota. “I’m thinking, 'Wow, not again.' Then my wife looks at me and says, 'You know who that is?'” Selwyn Jones is the uncle of George Floyd. He lives in Gettysburg South Dakota. (Photo: Submitted) As he continued to watch the video, Jones realized his nephew was the man under the officer’s knee crying for help. “The thing that disturbs me the most is hearing him call for my sister,” Jones said. “He starts calling for my sister and (his) mama because he probably knew that he was going to go away.” ‘He was always smiling’ Jones said he wants people to remember his nephew Floyd as a kind, gentle man who loved basketball and bodybuilding. “He always had a smile on his face,” Jones said. “He was always smiling and laughing.” Floyd, 46, had three children, Jones said, one of whom was a 6-year-old daughter still living in Houston with her mother. He moved from Houston to Minneapolis in 2014 to get “a change of direction in life to grow,” Jones said. Floyd was a star football player in high school, earning the nickname “gentle giant” for his 6’7 stature and his love for bodybuilding. Floyd also earned a basketball scholarship to a community college in Florida and went on to play on a club team known as To God Be The Glory Sports. More: George Floyd protests erupt across nation Floyd worked five years as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis and lost his job during Minnesota’s stay-home order. He also drove trucks and briefly worked security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. Jones lived in Rapid City for 20 years before moving to Gettysburg three years ago where he owns a motel. He said he was very close with Floyd and visited him in Minneapolis very often. Jones’s birthday was May 22, and he remembers Floyd texted him to wish him a happy birthday, the last communication they shared together. “George would have given the shirt off of his back” for anyone, Jones said. ‘He didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street’ Jones said it was hard to watch the officer in the video continue to roll his knee on Floyd’s throat. “That’s absolutely horrifying to see someone that’s loved get put into that situation,” Jones said. The video has millions of views, and that’s “millions of people who have seen my nephew get murdered in the streets of Minneapolis, for what reason?” Before moving to South Dakota, Jones grew up in a small town in North Carolina where he said he was used to seeing racism. “We’ve never seen a video of his caliber from start to finish,” Jones said. “He went unconscious because somebody felt some kind of power and control” over Floyd, Jones said. Jones said he is grateful for Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old who posted the video because without her, “none of this would have ever been known.” He said she just happened to be at a nearby bus stop and stayed close to Floyd filming the incident. “I talked to her last night and she said, ‘I can’t sleep.’ I can’t sleep, either. She said, ‘That’s all I can see. I can see your nephew begging, crying and dying at the same time. That’s all I can see: his face,’” Jones said. “Without her, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. She’s an angel. She is my hero right now.” Jones pointed to news reports that state Chauvin has had a history of use-of-force incidents over his career, including involvement as one of five officers placed on leave after they shot and wounded an indigenous man in 2011. “Doesn’t it disgust you to see someone put their knee around another human being’s neck, put their hand in their pocket and pose for the camera while he’s murdering somebody in broad daylight for everyone in the world to see?” Jones said. Mayor Jacob Frey called for Chauvin to be charged Wednesday, making no mention of the other three officers on-scene. “Maybe something will come from this that people stand up and see that this just isn’t right,” Jones said. “To watch my baby nephew suffer like an animal until they put him out of his misery … he didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street like trash.” Before Chauvin was arrested, Jones said, “I will be at every hearing, every trial, because I’m going to see this one through. I am going to be there when they’re sentenced so I can look them in the eye.” If they do receive jail time, the amount of time they receive “is going to absolutely mean nothing to me, his kids, his nephews, his nieces, his sisters, his brother, because we don’t get to see him and his big smile anymore.” Demonstrations set for Rapid City Jones said many people who are heartfelt about the issue who are rioting in Minneapolis and across the country about Floyd’s death are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones said. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones said he plans to attend a walk in memory of his nephew in Rapid City this weekend, which he said should remain peaceful. The demonstration in Rapid City was first planned by a group of organizers including Shaylene Cordero, Bec Thompson and Jodi Prue, who reached out to him recently to ask if he would join. “She’s an angel,” Jones said of Prue “We need more people like this in the world.” The walk is set for 3 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Park. Jones said he also hopes to schedule a walk in Sioux Falls. Jones said funeral arrangements for Floyd are not yet finalized, but it will likely be closer to family in Houston, Texas. “I don’t know if this will ever change,” Jones said. But as stories of Floyd’s life gain more attention and more demonstrations take place, “I think we have an opportunity to get our word out a little bit farther than ever before.” Read or Share this story: https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2020/05/29/george-floyds-uncle-speaks-out-my-nephew-begged-his-life/5282609002/",0.0

Download the CBS News app or visit cbsnews.com/minnesota to watch. A 12-year-old gospel singer named Keedron Bryant has written an original song about the heartbreaking realities of being a young black man. During a time of nationwide protests and unrest over police brutality and racial injustice, the boy's song has become a rallying cry. Bryant posted the video on Instagram on Wednesday with a simple caption: ""just singing what's on my heart...hope this blesses someone."" In the song, Bryant sings: ""I'm a young black man, doing all that I can to stand. Oh, but when I look around and I see what's being done to my kind every day, I'm being hunted as prey."" ""My people don't want no trouble, we've had enough struggle. I just want to live. God, protect me, I just want to live,"" the song continues. In the video, Bryant wears a shirt that reads ""Black Intelligence"" created by a Toronto-based streetwear company. Bryant also shared several hashtags with the video, including #ijustwantolive #blacklivesmatter and #equality. The a cappella performance has received nearly 2 million views on Bryant's page has been shared by countless people — including many celebrities. Singer and reality star Kandi Burrus shared a version of Bryant's song with music produced by Dem Jointz added to it. Former President Barack Obama called attention to the song in a message he tweeted Friday in response to Floyd's death. Mr. Obama said a friend of his ""used the powerful song that went viral by 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling."" He continued, ""The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others."" LeBron James, Eva Longoria, David Oyelow and Lupita Nyong'o also shared the video, along with many others. ""He should not have to sing this song,"" Nyong'o wrote in the caption of her post. The viral video comes after nationwide calls for justice in the officer-involved killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breona Taylor in Kentucky, as well as the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Floyd 46, died on Monday after a police officer kept his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes while he cried out that he couldn't breathe. The incident was caught on video and has sparked nationwide protests. Four officers were fired after Floyd's death, but many are calling for charges to be brought against them. Asked about Floyd on Thursday, President Trump said he felt ""very, very badly"" and called it ""a shocking sight."" ""I've asked the FBI and the Attorney General to take a very strong look and to see what went on, because that was a very, very bad thing that I saw I saw it last night and I didn't like it,"" he said. But after another night of violence amid the protests in Minneapolis, the president struck a different tone in a tweet calling protesters ""THUGS"" and warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" That language prompted Twitter to add a tag saying, ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""",0.0

Fires, looting and violence erupted after the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man seen on video begging for air as an officer pressed his knee into his neck.

Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct, Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis. John Minchillo / AP Walz, who on Thursday called in the National Guard to Minneapolis and declared a peacetime emergency, made an impassioned call for calm Friday, saying restoring order to the streets is crucial to begin work to repair systemic societal injustices in the state. He called to ""rebuild"" trust between the community and law enforcement. ""Our community, especially our black community, is hurting beyond words,"" Walz said Friday. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain and anguish unheard."" Overnight, protesters torched the police station where the four officers involved worked. Walz said the state took over response once the police station was set aflame after midnight and local law enforcement pulled back. Later in the day Friday, Walz imposed a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday for Minneapolis and St. Paul, in conjunction with city officials, in an attempt to quell further violence. Walz called for an end to the ""looting and recklessness."" ""We can't have it, because we can't have it in society. I refuse to have it take away the attention from the stain we need to be working on,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said that if the protester's message is that Floyd's death is intolerable and that the law enforcement system must change, ""that message has been received."" He said officials are committed to working towards reform. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass, we're going to fix the broken and shattered society that leaves so many people behind,"" Ellison said. Minnesota Department of Safety commissioner John Harrington said a team of local, state and federal law enforcement officers including the state patrol and Minnesota National Guard deployed to restore order overnight with an aim to allow people to protest but to keep people and property safe. George Floyd ""We cannot and will not be deployed to stifle free speech, but we will not and cannot allow dangerous and unlawful behavior to continue,"" Harrington said. He said the vast majority of the protesters ""are still having their guts ripped out about Floyd's murder"" and were not the group of people behind most of the unrest. Harrington said most of the crowd in the center of the violence on Lake Street dispersed when the uniformed law enforcement team arrived and asked them to leave. Those that didn't were arrested, he said. ""The people out there on Lake Street at 3 a.m. weren't the good people of Minnesota and Minneapolis, they weren't the people who wanted to mourn the loss of a friend and a relative and a neighbor,"" Harrington said. Harrington said he referred to Floyd's death as murder ""because that's what it looked like to me."" Walz also apologized for the arrest of a CNN reporter on air, calling it ""inexcusable.""",0.0

Tim Walz called in the National Guard after fires and vandalism erupted during protests. US President Donald Trump responded to the situation on Twitter, writing he would send the military to intervene and noting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" echoing a 1967 statement made by former Miami police chief Walter Headly over violent reprisals to protests of stop-and-frisk tactics. Two hours later, Twitter hid the tweet for violating the platform's standards on ""glorifying violence,"" though it is possible to view, as it is ""in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" The president's message posted to Facebook was not removed, despite violating that platform's community standards. This comes days after Twitter marked Trump tweets about mail-in voting as potentially misleading. The fact-check label prompted the president to issue an executive order targeting social media companies. The legality of the move was swiftly questioned, and its potential infringement on free speech echoes the moves of authoritarian leaders elsewhere.

(KELO) — Protests demanding justice for George Floyd will make their way to Sioux Falls this weekend. Police are working to make sure those protests remain peaceful. Friday afternoon, our camera crews spotted officers checking out the potential location of Saturday’s protest at 41st Street and Minnesota Avenue. “It was very difficult to watch.” Sioux Falls Police Chief Matt Burns says the department has a long history of supporting an individual’s right to protest. Officers will attend this weekend’s gatherings to ensure a safe environment, but Burns has a request. “Do so safely and bear in mind the rights of others around them, but it is their right to protest and we’re there to support them and make sure they can do that in a safe environment,” Burns said. “We’re not there to try and intimidate anybody; we just want to make sure everybody’s safe,” Sioux Falls Police spokesman Sam Clemens said. Sioux Falls Police have been in contact with organizers of Sunday’s protest that will end at the Law Enforcement Center. The department requires an assembly permit, which is free, but serves a purpose. “People can gather, people can protest, that’s a constitutional right. We’re not here to interfere with that, but when you start to have those gatherings you don’t always know who’s going to show up,” Clemens said. Another key to keeping protesters safe is in the details. “You want to make sure you understand the area and if there are certain things that could pose a danger such as a construction zone, such as a blind spot, or a spot that’s close to traffic,” Burns said. “More of kind of the route that they’re taking, making sure that people are on public property like on the sidewalks, that they’re not interfering with traffic, to make sure that they’re going to be in a place where they’re safe to protest and they’re not going to be put in harm’s way,” Clemens said. Keeping safety in mind, while protesting for change.

CBSN Minnesota has live, continuing coverage of the protests. Download the CBS News app or visit cbsnews.com/minnesota to watch. George Floyd's family attorney Ben Crump told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King Friday that he and the family will call on Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to take up Floyd's case after District Attorney Michael Freeman failed to announce charges for the four officers involved in Floyd's death, citing a need for more evidence. Crump, a renowned civil rights advocate who has represented the families of slain black men Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, said every day that goes by and the officers are not charged is like ""killing George all over again."" The arrest that led to Floyd's death was captured in a disturbing video that has outraged millions, where a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for eight minutes, seemingly ignoring bystanders and Floyd's own pleas for him to stop. His desperate cry for help, ""I can't breathe,"" echoes the death of Eric Garner, a black man who also died at the hands of police, and has been a rallying cry for increasingly violent protests this week. Read their conversation below: Gayle King: Ben Crump, we thank you for joining us. Unfortunately, this is becoming an all-too-familiar story for you. Five days ago we didn't even know George Floyd's name. Now many are heartbroken, angry, frustrated about what has happened. What is your message — what is the family's conversation about what has happened to George Floyd, and what they want to see happen now? Ben Crump: Gayle, it is all too familiar. And tragically this family, yet another black family, is in turmoil and just heartbroken after witnessing with their very eyes a young man who they have known all their life, his brothers and sisters talk about when they were little children, they're reflecting now knowing that George is gone. And the fact that the district attorney yesterday came out and made the report that there's not enough evidence, probable cause to make an arrest today, that they have to continue to investigate was an insult on top of injury. The fact that you see on the video, Gayle, the police have their knee on the neck — on his neck — not for one minute, not for two minutes, not for three minutes, not for four minutes, not for five minutes, not for six minutes, not for seven minutes, but over eight minutes. And that's what we cannot unsee, and that's why his family's in pain. That's why the protesters are in pain. King: But Ben, Benjamin Crump, in addition, there's new video, released overnight, where you see two other police officers — we've seen the horrific, heartbreaking video of Officer [Derek] Chauvin's knee on [Floyd's] neck. But in the other video from the other angle, you see two other officers holding down his legs. So as an official, what more have you been told that investigators need to see to bring charges in this case? What are you hearing? Crump: Gayle, when we talked directly to the district attorney's office, they said that they're trying to dot every I and cross every T. They said they want to talk to all the witnesses. And to us who lived through Eric Garner, you say, no, this delay seems like it's suggesting that you're going to try to sweep his death under the rug because that's what you did in Eric Garner when he said ""I can't breathe."" Now George Floyd said ""I can't breathe,"" and you all are telling us again you have to investigate this grand jury stuff. We're not going to allow that to happen. The witnesses are always important, but we have video. And if their stories contradict the video, then we take the video. That is the probable cause to arrest him now. And Gayle King, please understand this: we want witnesses to come forward. The family wants witnesses to come forward. Just like the family is praying for peace, the family wants protesters to be peaceful. However, the people who are in charge need to have a desire and want for justice, too. And that starts with simply making an arrest because you can continue your investigation, but every day these officers are not arrested is like another day of injustice to this family, it's like they're killing George all over again. None of us can breathe. King: I had a very interesting conversation with a young 20-something black woman, highly educated, a very, very intelligent person who said to me — I was saying, ""Look, the looting is going to dilute the message. The looting is not a good idea. It will overshadow what is happening to George Floyd."" And she said to me, ""Gayle, that was back in your day, your generation, you're older. Marching peacefully, holding hands and singing ""We shall overcome,"" nobody pays attention to that. This is the only way that we can get people's attention."" Does she have a point? I just so disagree with this thinking. Crump: Well, Gayle, I will tell you as Dr. King said, protesting and rioting is the language of the unheard. And in many ways, the protests, the first protests started while George Floyd was still alive. When you have a young lady who purported to be an EMT asked the police 16 times, ""Can I just take his pulse, you all are killing him,"" people saying, ""Take your knee off his neck,"" ""That was a form of protest — peaceful protest. Now, I do believe people the majority of people protesting are trying to do it peacefully and have their voices heard. There are some instigators out there that nobody wants. George Floyd's family doesn't want anybody to be hurt. They want peace. They're making a plea to people for peace and to stop looting. However, they're also making a plea, Gayle, to the powers that be. Arrest these murderers, do your job. That is another way to get peace because peace is more than just the absence of tension, it is the presence of justice. Where is the justice for George Floyd? Where is the justice for black America? All these unarmed black men, especially these open-season killings, and nobody being held accountable. King: Ben, you know, there's a tape circulating online about George Floyd. His language is a little salty, but let's not miss his point. He is encouraging young people to put down guns and do the right thing. He seemed to be an advocate for peace. I know the family is asking for an independent autopsy. What are they looking for, briefly, can you tell me? What do they want, what are they looking for? Crump: Yes, ma'am. We're taking possession of the body [Friday], and we're going to have Dr. Michael Bonnen do an independent autopsy because they do not trust law enforcement. Would you, after four days what you see on the video, nothing has happened? So we're going to have an independent autopsy. Also we're going to make the plea for Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, to take over this investigation based on what we heard yesterday. King: All right. We talked to Keith Ellison earlier today. Thank you very much, Ben Crump. I know this won't be our last conversation. Thank you, sir, for your time.",0.0

""If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,"" City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. ""Prevent property damage — it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence.

(AP) — The uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending a peaceful demonstration in Rapid City this weekend, but that he doesn't approve of the violent protests taking place in response to the killing. George Floyd died Monday after a white police officer knelt on his neck. Floyd's death has set off days of violent protests in the Twin Cities and across the U.S. “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Floyd's uncle, Selwyn Jones, told the Rapid City Journal. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones planned to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said he understands the frustration of the people who have been rioting, but that they are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.”",0.0

Floyd was handcuffed by a white officer and pleaded for air while the officer kneeled on his neck, an interaction that was captured on video after his death. Four officers in the incident were fired, and on Friday, Derek Chauvin was taken into custody and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Mr. Trump said during a Friday afternoon roundtable that he had spoken to Floyd's family. ""I thought it was a terrible thing. A terrible picture,"" the president said. ""I think that it's sad in so many ways from the standpoint of the family. When you look at George Floyd and his family. And you see what that's done to them just a terrible thing. He was in tremendous pain obviously. And couldn't breathe. It was very obvious to anybody that watched it. It was a very, very sad thing for me to see that."" Mr. Trump said he did not know the history behind the phrase he tweeted Friday morning — ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" In 1967, when robberies and civil unrest troubled black Miami neighborhoods, the white police chief Walter Headley warned, ""I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" After Twitter flagged that tweet as violating its rules about glorifying violence, the White House reiterated the message of the president's tweet — even though by then many online had pointed out the quote's racially charged history. ""Well I've heard that phrase for a long time, I don't know where it came from, where it originated ..."" Mr. Trump said. CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid interjected, ""In 1967, the Miami police chief used it."" ""Well I don't know I've also heard it from many other places, but I've heard it for a long time, as most people have,"" the president continued. ""And frankly it means when there's looting people get shot, and they die."" The president acknowledged that there were some ""good people"" present at the protests in Minnesota who simply wanted to speak out against what happened to Floyd, after tweeting overnight about ""thugs."" ""Well certainly there were a lot of different people and there were good people too, and they were protesting. And they were protesting for the right reason, they were protesting in honor of a man, George Floyd, where something happened that shouldn't have happened, in my opinion from what I've seen,"" the president said. ""Certainly something happened that shouldn't have happened. And, yeah, you had a lot of people out there that were protesting out of sorrow, and then you had people that got out of control. Some people."" Mr. Trump said the Justice Department is looking at the matter ""very strongly.""",0.0

We can't allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos."" Mr. Trump said he spoke with the family of George Floyd and demanded the Department of Justice and FBI expedite investigations into the Minnesota man's death. ""It's a local situation but we're also making it into a federal situation. And it's a terrible thing. We all saw what we saw,"" Mr. Trump added. As violence initially boiled over in the streets of Minneapolis Thursday night, Mr. Trump posted a string of reactions on Twitter, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen,"" he tweeted. ""Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Before being tweeted by the president, the phrase ""looting leads to shooting"" was uttered by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley as well as presidential candidate and notorious segregationist Governor George Wallace in the 1960s. Mr. Trump told CBS News White House Correspondent Paula Reid he did not know the historic origins of the phrase, but felt it was ""very accurate."" He added, ""Frankly it means when there's looting people get shot, and they die."" Mr. Trump's tweet was quickly flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" But Twitter also determined that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet to remain accessible. In an effort to amend his words, Mr. Trump followed up on Twitter Friday afternoon, writing that his use of the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" was ""spoken as a fact."" He added, ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!"" Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale defended Mr. Trump's initial response. ""When riots erupted in that city and elsewhere, he warned on Twitter that looting could quickly turn into violence,"" said Parscale, in a statement. He added, ""A man has died, a police officer is charged with murder, an American city is in chaos, and Democrats and the media see only a political opportunity and a chance to make money."" Earlier Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden said during livestream remarks that he had spoken with Floyd's family members. He also promised justice for Floyd, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Without naming the president or referencing his tweets about ""looting"" and ""shooting"", Biden said ""this is no time for incendiary tweets"" and ""no time to encourage violence."" Biden also aimed to speak about a larger problem of racism in the United States. ""We can't ignore that we are in a country with an open wound right now—a wound far older and deeper than…George Floyd's killing — and his brutal, brutal death captured on film,"" Biden said during a fundraiser Thursday evening. ""People all across this country are enraged and rightly so…Every day African-Americans go about their lives with [the] constant anxiety and trauma of wondering 'Will I be next?' sounds like an exaggeration, but it's not."" Vice President Mike Pence, while in Georgia, said his prayers are with the families of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, according to CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. Pence called Floyd's death ""tragic"" and said ""we have no tolerance for racism in America. We have no tolerance for violence inspired by racism in America. And as President Trump said, justice will be served."" The vice president added that ""we also believe in law and order in this country, and while we condemn violence against property or persons, we will also always stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest and let their voice be heard."" Pence said there are ""great challenges"" facing the United States but added he has ""confidence"" that just as Americans have stepped up to protect the health and well-being of their family and community, ""we will overcome the challenges that we face of racism in America. And we will come together as a nation and be stronger and better than ever before."" The killing of Floyd, 46, at the hands of Minneapolis police officers was captured on camera and has sparked protests across the country for days. CBS News reported that demonstrators set a Minneapolis police precinct on fire Thursday evening, the third consecutive day of protests. At a press conference Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the ashes from the fires in Minneapolis and St. Paul are ""symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman reports. ""I will not patronize you as a white man without living those, those lived experiences of how very difficult that is,"" Walz said. ""But I'm asking you to help us. Help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" Asked for his reaction to the president's tweets about the National Guard, Walz said he spoke to the president Thursday evening and added that Trump's tweets are ""just not helpful."" He continued, ""The city of Minneapolis is doing everything they can."" Former MPD officer Derek Chauvin — who was recorded kneeling on Floyd's neck for minutes before he died — was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Three other officers at the scene of the incident have been fired, but many elected officials are calling for more. ""It's not enough to fire the officers—they must be held accountable and an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices must be opened,"" California Senator Kamala Harris tweeted Thursday. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports that Stacey Abrams looked to the election to hold leaders accountable. ""Law enforcement, district attorneys, mayors, attorneys general, judges, legislators and governors must be held responsible—and their actions will be on the ballot in November,"" she tweeted on Friday. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says that Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida said the president continues to demonstrate that he is ""unfit"" for the office he holds. ""This isn't just about what's happening in Minnesota. This is about America as a nation. The nation is on fire and the President of the United States is standing there with gasoline,"" said Demings during a virtual event hosted by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action Friday. ""If he wants to bring America together, then talk about what justice looks like. Talk about the persons involved needing to be held accountable."" Former President Obama also weighed in, calling for a thorough investigation and change in what's deemed ""normal"" in America, reports Navarro. ""We have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal'— whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in the park,"" he wrote. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" FROM THE CANDIDATES PRESIDENT TRUMP Mr. Trump announced Friday that he's ""terminating"" the United States' relationship with the World Health Organization, claiming China has total control over it. As he listed a litany of grievances with China, the president announced he's suspending the entry of certain Chinese nationals and sanctioning Chinese officials who have eroded Hong Kong's freedom. CBS News Digital White House reporter Katie Watson reports the president for weeks has expressed frustration with China, blaming the communist country and in part the W.H.O. for the spread of the deadly virus that has left more than 100,000 dead in the U.S. ""Our actions will be strong, our actions will be meaningful,"" Mr. Trump said. But he hasn't always been so harsh on China. In the early days of the pandemic, the president applauded Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the pandemic. ""China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus,"" the president tweeted on January 24. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"" Mr. Trump will kick off in-person fundraising events next month, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga confirms. The move reverses a temporary pause in in-person fundraising caused by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. According to a campaign senior official, Mr. Trump is set to host a June 11 event at a private home in Dallas, Texas, as well as a June 13 outdoor fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Political organizers are working to ensure event safety for the president and his attendees, with the White House medical unit and Secret Service evaluating all guests before they're admitted to the sanitized venue. Each attendee will be required to test negative for the coronavirus on the day of the event, pass a temperature screening, and fill out a health questionnaire. Events will be kept to approximately 25 guests total, per fundraiser. The Trump campaign and RNC joint fundraising committee will cover the cost of administering tests. Mr. Trump last conducted a political fundraiser on March 6 at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. It was his sixth fundraiser this year and 99th since taking office. Politico was the first to report this story. VEEPSTAKES AMY KLOBUCHAR Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota were joined by 26 of their Senate colleagues in writing a letter to Attorney General William Barr calling for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to investigate the ""patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing"" in the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. ""Those responsible must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law in order to serve justice for George Floyd and his loved ones,"" the letter says. ""And we must work toward justice for the community, which means ensuring that the MPD accounts for and eliminates any unconstitutional police practices. It is imperative that the Department of Justice do its part toward that end."" CONVENTIONAL WISDOM PARTY PLANNING Republican officials planning their party's convention swapped their list of demands with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper this week, ahead of the August event in Charlotte. On Monday, Mr. Trump threatened to move his party's convention from North Carolina if Cooper did not lift restrictions imposed in response to the coronavirus pandemic to allow for ""full attendance."" CBS News campaign reporters LaCrai Mitchell and Nicole Sganga report the event is expected to draw thousands of attendees amid the state's recovery. Hours after North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called on the Republican National Committee to outline how the party plans to conduct a safe national convention, the RNC sent a list of health and safety protocols for approval on Thursday. The memo, addressed to the Democratic governor, came with a hard deadline of June 3. The letter from GOP officials makes no mention of wearing face masks, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, and which is a measure that the president does not follow. The RNC also promised ""anti-bacterial gel will be widely available"" in the arena and an ""aggressive sanitizing protocol"" will be in place for all public areas. Party officials three weeks ago hired physician Dr. Jeffrey Runge as a senior adviser for convention planning. Cooper's administration fired back with its own letter Friday, requesting Republican officials outline plans to test convention participants and indicate whether the president still intends to host ""people together in a crowd-like"" setting without social distancing or face coverings. The letter asked the RNC to clarify how many people would be in attendance, a detail not specified in the party's initial memo. ""While North Carolina is now in Phase 2 of easing restrictions, this past week we had our highest day of new lab confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, and we have increasing numbers of people hospitalized with COVID-19,"" Cooper wrote in his memo to McDaniel and Kelly. ""The status of COVID-19 infections in our state and in the Charlotte area continues to rapidly evolve, thus, it will be important to have several scenarios planned that can be deployed depending on the public health situation."" The letter from North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services marks the most recent development in an ongoing saga that began with a series of tweets from the president earlier this week. The president said Monday that Cooper would need to make ""a fast decision"" about whether the party could hold its convention at full capacity. MONEY MATTERS BIDEN V. TRUMP It's hard to believe it's nearly June, but that means presidential candidates are facing their latest fundraising deadline, according to CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. Ahead of the end of the month, the Biden campaign gave itself a $6 million fundraising goal in six days. ""With $3 million left to go before Sunday night, we need to keep up our momentum today,"" read an email sent to supporters on Friday. It's a sharp increase from the $1.5 million goal the Biden campaign set for itself in the last week of February before the former vice president had won a single primary. Meanwhile, according to a fundraising email, the Trump campaign set itself an $8 million goal by the end of the month. While Biden is closing the gap in terms of end of month fundraising targets, Mr. Trump's campaign has a massive cash advantage. At the end of April, it along with the RNC and related committees had more than $255 million cash on hand. In mid-May, Biden's campaign manager revealed he had $103 million cash on hand. PAC ATTACK Pro-Trump super PAC America First Action has poured $7.5 million into advertisements that zero in on likely presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports that digital, cable and broadcast advertisements as well as flyers will target voters in the political battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The month-long push will begin June 4 – the day after the Trump campaign's current ad-buy is scheduled to end in those three states. Last month, America First Action spent $10 million on a #BeijingBiden campaign portraying former Vice President Joe Biden as soft on China. SMALL BILLS The platform used by Democrats for fundraising announced a milestone this week. According to ActBlue, it has raised $5 billion dollars from grassroots donors since its founding in 2004. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says this includes $1 billion that was raised in just the last six months. ActBlue had previously announced last November that it had raised $4 billion since its founding. ""Hitting this milestone so quickly is yet another indicator that small-dollar donors on the left are more fired up for this election than ever,"" said ActBlue Executive Director Erin Hill in a statement. The milestone comes as candidates and organizations have had to move their fundraising efforts nearly completely online due to the pandemic. STATE-BY-STATE ARIZONA CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin says Mr. Trump this week celebrated a new $100 million infusion of federal money into a light rail expansion in Arizona, trumpeting ""very exciting news"" for an infrastructure project that had been fiercely opposed by members of his own party in the swing state last year and championed by Phoenix's Democratic mayor. ""We are losing hundreds of millions of dollars on light rail that we should be using to hire more public safety officers and to repair our roads,"" local GOP lawmaker Sal DiCiccio had decried on Facebook in 2019. CALIFORNIA California Governor Gavin Newsom spent the first 10 minutes of his press conference on Friday discussing George Floyd's death. Newsom said millions of Americans are trying to come to grips with the situation, adding ""there is deep anger, there is deep frustration, and there is deep fear."" CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports Newsom said the hearts, minds and culture of Americans needs to change, not just laws. He said America ""predominantly values power, dominance, and aggression over care, empathy, and collaboration."" Those values that ""we seem to be so attracted to as a nation"" are not serving us anymore, Newsom said. The California Governor also said the state is working with local leaders to prepare for any planned protests. ""I pray that all of us that want to express ourselves do so thoughtfully and gently but forcefully in terms of expressing themselves, as they, and as they must, so that we collectively can not only hear your voice but we can resolve to do something with the lesson that we learn."" Newsom was asked about Mr. Trump's tweets attacking California's vote-by-mail plans for November. Mr. Trump has claimed Newsom is sending ballots to anyone in the state no matter where they live or how they got here, but the governor's executive order automatically sends ballots only to registered voters. ""I think this is a sideshow,"" Newsom said of the president's tweets about vote-by-mail and his threats to shut down social media platforms. ""This has been a diversion tactic much more than anything else,"" he added. Newsom said he is focused on ""trying to unite this country not along the lines of Democrats or Republicans,"" saying, ""I will engage in conversation and debate with and about the president, with and about the issues that appear on the nightly news, but none that are more important and pressing than the issue of race relations in this country and addressing the public health of an entire diverse population."" INDIANA There are concerns large numbers of Indiana voters may not receive their absentee ballots in time to vote in Tuesday's primary, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. According to the Indy Star, Marion County Clerk Myla Eldridge, whose county includes Indianapolis, has asked the secretary of state to extend the deadline for receiving absentee ballots. Currently, the deadline to return them is noon on Tuesday. ""What a shame it will be for voters and candidates if thousands of votes sit in stacks uncounted under these circumstances,"" Eldridge said in the letter to Secretary of State Connie Lawson. There have reportedly been a variety of issues in Marion County, including some people ""who applied over email were told they never applied for one despite receiving a confirmation from the county election division"" and some households where one person received a ballot and the other did not. ""With the obvious and intended increase in mailed ballots, what is the compelling rationale for not extending the time for their receipt by county election boards?"" Eldridge said in the letter. Lawson responded to Eldridge in a letter on Friday criticizing Marion County for not taking action sooner, saying her office has been willing to help and there were earlier times to do so. ""Marion County repeatedly indicated its capacity to manage this Primary Election,"" Lawson said in her letter. ""Lack of prior planning and preparation are not sufficient reasons to change deadlines. In fact, extending this deadline will not help as many Marion County voters haven't received a ballot. Deadlines are in place for security and accountability purposes."" Lawson also said she spoke to Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett about the concerns and he plans to send more staff to help with absentee ballot processing. MINNESOTA The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party announced they will be postponing their state convention that was scheduled to occur this weekend, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Ken Martin, the DFL party chairman, said in a statement that it is not the time for a ""partisan political rally."" Martin added that postponing the convention was the ""only appropriate course of action given the grief and anger gripping much of our state and nation following the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent unrest sweeping the Twin Cities."" NEVADA The Nevada State Democratic Party is ramping up its ""voter protection"" team, helmed by Buttigieg campaign alum Emily Goldman, ahead of an election already fraught with litigation over changes prompted by the pandemic. Compared to past cycles, CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports the state party says they are planning their largest program to date manning their election day hotline, observing at polling sites, and liaising with county election officials. Rachana Desai Martin, who led Democrats' voter protection efforts in Nevada for 2016, was recently tapped by Biden's campaign to lead their national program. CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE After seeing House Democrats take the majority by winning 30 districts in 2018 that President Trump had won just 2 years earlier, House Republicans immediately seized on these seats as their path back to the majority, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In total, Republicans need a net gain of at least 17 seats to flip the chamber back. They're specifically energized around the 13 ""ruby red"" districts where Mr. Trump won by more than 6 points in 2016. However, vulnerable ""frontline"" House Democrats have had a prolific fundraising year so far — 26 of these members have more than $2 million cash on hand. After recent redistricting in North Carolina, Democrats are also expected to add two more seats to their ranks and have laid out an offensive effort across the map and especially in Texas, where retirements and close 2018 race results have kept Democrats optimistic. Congressional primaries in many of these districts have yet to take place, and Republican recruits are facing some massive fundraising deficits, compared to the incumbents they're challenging. But Republicans believe that because these freshman Democratic members now have records in Congress they can run against, they'll be able to capitalize on Mr. Trump's support in these districts to help flip the House. Republicans are also encouraged by their recent win in California's 25th District special election, where Mike Garcia, a former Navy fighter pilot and the son of a Mexican immigrant, in May became the first Republican to flip a House seat in California held by a Democrat since 1998. A memo by Tom Emmer, chair of the House Republican campaign arm, said the committee will ""run the same playbook in November that Democrats ran so well against the GOP in 2018: Exploiting the legislative records of our opponents with our diverse field of candidates.""

1620630876,2020-05-29 23:24:45,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow across the U.S.,https://www.keloland.com/top-stories/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,91060,keloland.com,http://www.keloland.com/#spider,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

1620630872,2020-05-29 23:12:00,Twin Cities residents share experiences during protests,https://www.keloland.com/news/national-world-news/twin-cities-residents-share-experiences-during-protests/,en,False,,91060,keloland.com,http://www.keloland.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (KELO) — Former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been charged by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office with murder and with manslaughter. The deadly arrest – caught on camera – is triggering a national outcry. In the Twin Cities, Floyd’s death led to days of protests, looting and fires. Twin Cities residents spoke about what about what life has been like this past week. Phil Finocchiaro lives 10 blocks from University Avenue in St. Paul. Last night he had to drive a friend of his, who’s a St. Paul Police Officer into work for safety reasons. “The intensity was just incredible. Moving up to the precinct, block by block. More cops, more people just wandering, just loitering. Then we were only able to get to two blocks from the precinct,” St. Paul resident Phil Finocchiaro said. While down there, Phil says he saw plenty of looting and damage done to the area. “There was fires left and right, at Goodwill and a bunch of other shops,” Finocchiaro said. In Minneapolis, the 3rd Police Precinct was abandoned and set ablaze last night, visible from my younger brother Patrick’s apartment rooftop. “So I looked over toward Southeast Minneapolis and I could see a big building in flames, and I could see fireworks just shooting off,” Patrick Bower said. Many businesses across Minneapolis and St. Paul have been looted during the protests. In nearby St. Louis Park, grocery stores are boarded up as a precaution. “Cub, Lund’s, Fresh Time, Trader Joe’s, Aldi, and Target. All of those that I just listed were closed off,” St. Louis Park Resident Errol Ilbuga said. Both Minneapolis and St. Paul have put in 8 p.m. curfews, hoping it can keep the protests peaceful. “Hopefully this doesn’t spill into another night of riot, which could potentially lead to the burning of property, and hopefully not personal property like housing,” Ilbuga said. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says more charges for Chauvin could come if their investigation warrants. The other three officers involved in Floyd’s death are still being investigated.",0.0
1620631911,2020-05-29 21:29:46,COMMENTARY: Patrick Bernadeau: The focus should remain on George Floyd,https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/opinion/columns/6513615-COMMENTARY-Patrick-Bernadeau-The-focus-should-remain-on-George-Floyd,en,False,,32194,mitchellrepublic.com,http://www.mitchellrepublic.com#spider,"This cycle, this discussion, this division. In the aftermath of four Minneapolis police officers killing George Floyd, one of my worst fears has been realized: too many of us have become distracted by the riots in the Twin Cities. Don’t get me wrong. It is certainly a story, it just should never be the story. Not all of us have been distracted, though. There’s been support as many of us in the country grieve. One particular item that’s been encouraging has been from the people in blue. Police chiefs from Florida, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma and others from states across the country have condemned the actions that took place on Chicago Avenue on Monday night. In these situations, the police generally back the police, but the heroes that protect and serve this nation were swift in joining in on the disgust. Less swiftly, after four days, those actions have (finally) resulted in the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer that had his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck and refused to ease up despite Floyd’s final pleas to breathe. The charges are third-degree murder and manslaugther. The focus should remain on Monday night. The focus should shift toward the courts and a possible conviction. The focus needs to be on actual change. But in just four days, the focus has taken some hits. Fires set ablaze on buildings. Windows smashed. Looting. All of which have overshadowed the peaceful protestors who just asked that people from a particular community not to be treated like they are disposable. That was my initial concern as this became the top news story in the nation. In a week, what are we, as a whole, going to be talking about? I was also concerned with the innocent lives affected by the riots. Workers and small business owners suddenly find themselves with a further uphill climb during a painfully tough economic time. Sure, Target and other billion-dollar companies likely will be able to recover and quickly rebuild while the other businesses probably have insurance on their buildings to help clean up the rubble and alleviate matters. But, selfishly, I would sure hate to no longer have a job to go to or as a small business owner in the community, have more things stacked on my plate during a worldwide pandemic. As for lives affected in the distant future, near the intersection of Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue in Minneapolis, a construction site for an affordable housing project was torched. Not to be dismissed, there actually has been another life loss because of the unrest. Calvin L. Horton, 43, was fatally shot just outside of Cadillac Jewelry in Minneapolis by the pawn shop owner who suspected Horton was a looter. This is all why in a previous story, I said there is no strong excuse for rioting. However, that should not be mistaken for no excuse or defense at all. During an NFL preseason game nearly four years ago, Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, remained seated during the playing of the national anthem as silent protest against forms of injustice against the black community. As the weeks progressed, Kaepernick adjusted his protest to kneeling. The NFL owners responded by keeping him out of the league for the last three years and counting. Some fans responded by choosing to boycott the NFL as television ratings for the games momentarily went down. President Donald Trump responded with the following statement in a rally in September 2017: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!” I have a hard time fully supporting rioting while seeing all the damage and destruction, but I also can’t say that I don’t understand it either. If silent and peaceful protests for injustice, which Floyd’s death serves as an example to this day, were met with that kind of resistance, it’s pretty easy to realize why rioting is the strategy today. If silently kneeling before a football game was too uncomfortable for some to drive the attention to the real issues, the next logical step is to make a good deal of noise to get people to listen. In more recent news, the leader of the free world took to Twitter on Thursday night. Calling the looters “THUGS’ and critical of local leadership in Minneapolis, particularly “very weak Radical Left” Mayor Jacob Frey, Trump implied that he would intervene if the city and rioting could not be brought under control, ending his tweets with “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter, taking those words as an advocacy of violence, placed a disclaimer on the tweet. On Friday afternoon, Trump said his tweet was misunderstood, stating “as a fact” that looting could lead to more shooting. Additionally, Trump referenced the seven people who were shot in Louisville, Ky., on Thursday night during protests for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black person who was shot and killed in her apartment by police in March. Surely, Trump supporters will take a side while anti-Trumpers will be on the other side. Like gasoline on a flame, division in a long-divided country will only widen. And that’s disappointing, because when it comes to this issue, the death of George Floyd should take a backseat. In the span of four days, our main focus is not as clear as it should, but given how past situations have gone, we all should have seen this coming. When it comes to injustices to the black community, it’s hard not to think that some people simply don’t care. I will still push for change and hope that with this outlet, I will have a voice to help along the way. That is my focus. As for everyone else, this just shouldn’t be as difficult as we make it out to be. Patrick Bernadeau is a sports reporter for the West Central Tribune of Willmar, Minnesota.  ",0.0

""Our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,"" Zuckerberg wrote. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter and Facebook early Friday that Minneapolis protesters were ""thugs"" and wrote ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The second tweet in the thread was quickly flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" Mr. Trump's full Facebook post remained visible one day later. Zuckerberg wrote that he has been ""struggling with how to respond to the President's tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric."" But, Zuckerberg wrote, he is ""responsible for reacting not just in my personal capacity but as the leader of an institution committed to free expression."" Later Friday, Mr. Trump tried to clarify his posts, writing that ""looting leads to shooting ... I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means."" He also said he wasn't aware of the origin of the words, attributed to a Miami police chief in 1967 during a period of unrest in that city. Protests have erupted nationwide over the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis after a white officer kneeled on his neck. Four officers in the incident have been fired, and on Friday, Derek Chauvin was taken into custody and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. ""Although the post had a troubling historical reference, we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force,"" Zuckerberg wrote. The Verge reported on Friday afternoon that Facebook employees have criticized the company's decision to leave up Mr. Trump's posts about Minneapolis and about mail-in ballots, which Twitter has also flagged. ""I have to say I am finding the contortions we have to go through incredibly hard to stomach,"" one employee wrote in a comment, according to The Verge. ""All this points to a very high risk of a violent escalation and civil unrest in November and if we fail the test case here, history will not judge us kindly."" Facebook has faced scrutiny for allowing misinformation to spread on its platform during the 2016 election. Zuckerberg told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell last week that Facebook would remove posts that spread misinformation about the coronavirus. For example, it took down the widely-debunked ""Plandemic"" video. ""There's harmful misinformation, which is the type of thing that puts people in imminent physical risk,"" Zuckerberg told O'Donnell. ""So, if you're telling someone that social distancing doesn't work, or that something that's proven to be a cure when it isn't, we want to take that off our services completely. There's other misinformation which is not generally going to cause physical harm, it's just stuff that's wrong. We want to stop it from going viral, and there we work with independent fact-checkers, which has led to us showing about 50 million warning labels on content that people have seen.""",0.0

Now in the fourth day of nationwide protests, demonstrators in Minneapolis peacefully marched across Hennepin Avenue Bridge, according to CBS Minnesota. What appeared to be thousands of protestors blocked traffic, kneeling down and raising their fists, much like Kaepernick did in 2016. Kaepernick has tweeted his support for the protests, and has pinned the message to his profile. ""When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction.

""If you care about this city, then go home,"" Bottoms urged at a late-night press conference. Atlanta's protest was one of many raging across the nation Friday night, as people took to the streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a police officer kept his knee on his neck even after he repeatedly begged for air. In Minneapolis, the site of Floyd's death, local officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew — but many protesters remained on the streets. Read Bottoms' remarks below: Let me just speak to what is happening here today. Above everything else, I am a mother. I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old. And when I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother would hurt. And yesterday when I heard there were rumors about violent protests in Atlanta, I did what a mother would do, I called my son and I said, 'Where are you?' I said, 'I cannot protect you and black boys shouldn't be out today.' So, you're not going to out concern me and out care about where we are in America. I wear this each and every day, and I pray over my children, each and every day. So what I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest, this is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr., this is chaos. A protest has purpose. When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn't do this to our city. So, if you love this city, this city that has had a legacy of black mayors and black police chiefs and people who care about this city, where more than 50% of the business owners in metro Atlanta are minority business owners, if you care about this city, then go home. And pray that somebody like Reverend Beasley will come and talk to you and give you some instructions on what a protest should look like, and how you effect change in America. This police chief [Atlanta police chief Erika Shields] made a video yesterday, pull it up on YouTube. Where she said she was appalled to watch the murder of George Floyd. This woman did that. You're not honoring a legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement. You are not protesting anything running out with brown liquor in your hands, breaking windows in this city. T.I., Killer Mike owned half the West side, so when you burn down this city, you're burning down our community. If you want change in America, go and register to vote. Show up at the polls on June 9th. Do it in November. That is the change we need in this country. You are disgracing our city, you are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city, we are better than this as a country. Go home. Go home. In the same way I can protect my son yesterday, I cannot protect you out in those streets. You are throwing knives at our police officers, you are burning cars. You have defaced the CNN building. Ted Turner started CNN in Atlanta 40 years ago because he believed in who we are as a city. There was a black reporter who was arrested on camera this morning, who works for CNN, they are telling our stories. And you are disgracing their building. This is not the legacy of civil rights in America. This is chaos, and we are buying into it. This won't change anything, we are no longer talking about the murder of an innocent man. We are talking about how you are burning police cars on the streets of Atlanta, Georgia. Go home.",0.0

1621020716,2020-05-30 11:21:18,Protests over George Floyd death overwhelm Minneapolis authorities again,https://www.keloland.com/top-stories/protests-over-george-floyd-death-overwhelm-authorities-again/,en,True,,91060,keloland.com,http://www.keloland.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn’t have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. RELATED: Police appear to shoot TV reporter, photographer with pepper balls There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death.",0.0

PAUL — In response to several nights of destructive riots in Minneapolis sparked by the death of local 46-year-old George Floyd in police custody, Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday morning, May 30 announced the ""full mobilization"" of the Minnesota National Guard. It will be the first time that the National Guard has been marshaled in the state at that scale, he said, amid what has already been called the largest domestic deployment of the Guard in Minnesota in its 164-year history. While acknowledging the trauma that Floyd's death has inflicted on Minneapolis's black communities and communities of color, Walz condemned this week's rioting in strong terms. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" he said during a Saturday press conference. Walz and other local officials said that violent groups and individuals active in the Twin Cities area in recent days are believed to come from outside of the state and region. Criminal groups may be behind some of the looting and fire-setting that have ravaged the metro. Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul said individual arrested by city police Friday night came from outside of the state, for example. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said his agency has seen social media posts from white supremacist groups that said they planned to travel here and agitate the situation as well. Harrington said that additional information on the background of groups believed to be inciting violence in the cities would be released sometime Saturday. Arrest figures were not immediately available. Peaceful protest over Floyd's death planned for Saturday, Walz said, will still be allowed to take place but additional Guard soldiers and airmen will be deployed to the Twin Cities are to reinforce local law enforcement agencies based here. Up to 2,500 Guard service members will be in the area by noon, according to Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. ""We're all in,"" Jensen said stoically. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis warned that protesters out after the ongoing 8 p.m. curfew put in place Friday may passively provide cover for violent actors, making it difficult for authorities to suss them out. ""We'll need everybody complying,"" he said. Derek Chauvin, the now-former Minneapolis police officer who was taped kneeling on Floyd's neck in the moments leading up to his death, was arrested a day earlier and charged with murder in the third degree as well as manslaughter. But his arrest and the Friday night curfews put in place to tamp down on the chaos seemed to have failed to quell the rage that surges through the area. And while many neighborhoods rallied to clean up businesses smashed in the frenzy, many more were set ablaze Friday evening, according to police radio reports. The protests and riots come at a time when Minnesota and the U.S. are still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Many demonstrators are wearing masks and face covering but social distancing has gone by the wayside in a move that could further exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.",0.0

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) President Trump praised the U.S. Secret Service for it response to overnight protests outside the White House, saying protesters would have been met with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons” if they had managed to breach the fences. The unrest came as demonstrations erupted in cities across the United States in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. “Great job last night at the White House by the U.S. @SecretService. They were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn’t have felt more safe,” Mr.Trump said in one of several tweets about the demonstrations. “They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them. The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic.” “Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would…have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least,” Mr. Trump continued. He said Secret Service officers were “just waiting for action,” saying he was told: “We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and…good practice.” “As you saw last night, they were very cool & very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. ‘Not their job.’ Nice!” Mr. Trump wrote in a fourth an final tweet. The White House was locked down on Friday evening as around 200 people gathered in front of the White House. Protesters pulled away the barricades that separated them from the White House. The Secret Service restored the barricades back in their place once they were knocked down, but it became almost a game, CBS News’ Fin Gomez reported. Thousands of protesters congregated elsewhere in Washington, D.C., according to CBS Washington affiliate WUSA. Protesters face off with police outside the White House in Washington, D.C., early on May 30, 2020 during a demonstration over the death of George Floyd.ERIC BARADAT/AFP VIA GETTY First published on May 30, 2020 / 9:43 AM",0.0

Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. This marks NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission has unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits.

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year. (The Associated Press contributed to this report)",0.0

Violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked a Minneapolis neighborhood for a second straight night as angry crowds looted stores, set fires and left a path of damage that stretched for miles. The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. (Elizabeth Flores/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — First-term Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey appeared to be doing everything right. He worked with the city’s booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city’s body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd’s death. But Frey’s leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd’s death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city’s 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn’t confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, “What’s the plan here?” Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz — like Frey, a Democrat — criticized the “abject failure” of the city’s response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a “very weak Radical Left Mayor” and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn’t have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey’s approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd’s killing, refused to discuss the mayor’s response except to say that Frey had been “put in a difficult position.” He said the black community doesn’t trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. “The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,” Reeves said. “This is not about the mayor; it’s about the police department.” The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was “out of his depth” and “clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.” He said abandoning the police station “sent a powerful message” that the city was not in control. “There needs to be another message: ‘Here is the line and order will be maintained,’” said Jacobs. “You’ve got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. “He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.” Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. “There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,” said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. “They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.” But he believes the mayor is “leading with his values” and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. “Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it’s crumbled,” Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

Saturday's event beginning at the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial takes place as protests continue for the fifth day in Minneapolis after George Floyd died in the custody of Minneapolis police on Monday. EMBED: Saturday George Floyd protest live video The protest began at the memorial with speeches, and moved along First Street toward City Hall, with protesters shouting, ""No justice, no peace. Prosecute the police,” and “I can’t breathe” — what Floyd repeated several times as the police officer held a foot on his neck. The Duluth Police Department and the city of Duluth announced Saturday morning that they would monitor the protest and are prepared should the event escalate. “We expect a peaceful assembly of people who are gathering to express their First Amendment rights,” a news release from the police department read. “DPD will be in the area to ensure free speech rights can be exercised safely, but we will give people the space to protest.” A news release from the city of Duluth asked the community to stay calm and remain peaceful should they participate in the event. A previous protest by the same organizers started at the intersection of 21st Avenue East and London Road in Duluth on Wednesday evening, drawing more than 100 people. Other protests in the Northland have been promoted on social media. The Hibbing Police Department said in a news release Saturday that it received “several reports” of groups planning to protest Sunday at Hibbing High School and Monday at Hibbing City Hall. “The Hibbing Police Department respects a peaceful protest and asks the public to use safety during the protest if it occurs,” the news release read. “We want to remind the public that protesting on private property without permission is not allowed. We also want to remind the public that blocking city streets and throughways is also not allowed without the proper permit issued by the city of Hibbing.” “Justice for George Floyd,” another event promoted on Facebook as a “peaceful protest,” is scheduled for noon Sunday outside the St. Louis County Courthouse in Virginia.

Saturday, May 30 marked the fifth day of rallies and protests since George Floyd died in police custody Monday, May 25 after one of four arresting Minneapolis Police officers knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, captured on an eyewitness video. After days of peaceful demonstrations and destructive riots alike, government officials vowed today to crack down on later — some of whom they claim are being instigated by out-of-state groups bent on inciting violence.

Kurt Joseph, a Minneapolis activist, spoke to the crowd but turned around to face the precinct building, aiming his megaphone at police watching from the roof. ""Do you hear us?"" Joseph asked. “No one body in this crowd has got a gun,” he said. ""We’re not going to hurt you."" The area had earlier been center of a clash between demonstrators and police late Friday, May 29 and early Saturday morning. Further east down Lake Street, the Minneapolis Third Precinct building was heavily damaged by fire earlier in the week. Area leaders expressed optimism about early crowd control efforts. Even with a weekend curfew in effect as of 8 p.m., local, county and state public safety agencies have already reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities. Still, Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said during Saturday's late night press event that the service branch is ""in a position of strength."" Hundreds of police and National Guard soldiers pushed protesters west down Lake Avenue firing canisters of chemical irritant and rubber bullets into the crowd. But officials conceded during press appearances Saturday that local law enforcement failed to adequately respond to the frenzy. Reinforcing them tonight are an estimated 2,5000 Minnesota National Guard airmen and soldiers who Gov. Tim Walz had deployed in the state's first full mobilization of the service branch. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may yet be deployed, according to a Guard news release. Walz and others said during a Saturday afternoon, May 30, press conference that they have reason to believe that some of the groups responsible for looting and fires reported in Minneapolis and St. Paul may have criminal ties. But late into the evening, officials were evasive about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. Early in the evening Walz expressed their support for peaceful protesters and made a final appeal for them to stay at home overnight. ""I am asking each and every Minnesotan to be clear about this. These are not our neighbors. These are not the people that put in the work to build Lake Street, to build community,"" Walz said. In anticipation of further unrest, local business owners throughout the metro area have boarded up shop throughout the Twin Cities area. Minneapolis, St. Paul and many surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday. All four of the officers involved in the incident Monday, meanwhile, have been fired. One, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter Thursday. None of the other officers have been charged — all sources of anger for assembling crowds. Near the police station, Joseph urged the crowd to stay vigilant to fight for justice but to fight against impulses to destroy the community. He said agitators, most of them white, were causing most of the problems. A constant vigil at the site where Floyd died has been free of serious violence or fires, which community leaders say is because people there are wary of outsiders and people are directing their anger toward change. “It takes something other than what’s inside us as individual human beings,” said The Rev. Brian Herron, one of the people leading some of the vigils. Outside the Fifth Precinct building, Joseph also alluded to a bigger cause and urged the crowd to disregard the narrative that people were destroying their own communities. However, he also directed blame toward racism within police departments across the U.S. “We’re standing amid a war zone that they started,” he said.

Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up.

Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference.

Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire.

Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew.

George Floyd, the man on the ground in Minneapolis, died. The officer refused to ease the deadly pressure on his neck, despite Floyd’s repeated appeals captured on video – “I can’t breathe!” – and the pleading of horrified bystanders. He and three other officers who stood by and failed to intervene have been fired. Charges are likely. In Grand Forks, Officer Cody Holte died after coming to the aid of deputies attempting to serve eviction papers. A woman in the apartment also was killed by gunfire. Two others, including the man alleged to have initiated the gunfire and a Grand Forks County deputy sheriff, suffered gunshot injuries. The deputy sheriff was released from the hospital Thursday evening. In one city, the community has rightfully rallied to the fallen officer and to all men and women in blue, lighting the night sky with homage in blue, offering support and thanks for doing a difficult and often dangerous job. In the other city, anger led to looting, vandalism and the setting of fires, which will complicate efforts to bring about justice and a better world. The violence in Minneapolis is wrong. It will harden the attitudes of people inclined to believe that police are justified in the use of overwhelming force and paramilitary power. It will provide cover to people who have no interest in dealing with the long-festering, underlying reasons for anger. But hear the truth in words spoken more than 50 years ago by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.: “A riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? … It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.” And hear the plaintive words of Jacob Frey, mayor of Minneapolis: “Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man’s neck. Five minutes.” George Floyd may have committed a crime. He may have committed many crimes. He may have initially resisted the officer. He may have had serious medical issues that contributed to his death. It doesn’t matter. He should not have stopped breathing because a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he lay, handcuffed, on the street. Do you know these names? Eric Garner, New York. Michael Brown, Ferguson, Mo. Black people know those names and many others. They know how those men died. We have to accept that some police-involved shootings are justifiable, lawful. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t demand transparency, compassion and justice when they are not. Whenever I hear about a black man who dies in an interaction with police, I think of a friend, Jerry Holt, who was a colleague at the Star Tribune. He is a talented photographer, whether reporting from South Africa when Nelson Mandela was elected president, from Uganda during the AIDS epidemic, or from Twin Cities playgrounds where people helped disabled kids play baseball. He is many other things. He is a retired Marine. He is a father. He practices martial arts. And he is black. Many years ago, Jerry was chasing a breaking story in the suburbs of Minneapolis, where police were hunting for a suspect who had been identified as a black man. As Jerry approached several officers, cameras hanging from his neck, they drew their guns. This week, I asked him if the memory of that encounter returns at times like these. “You never forget when someone points a gun in your face,” he said. Investigations continue in both Minneapolis and Grand Forks, and more details may help us understand what happened. But this much we know: George Floyd should be alive today. Cody Holte should be alive today. And we know that things must change. We have to deal with insane income inequality. We have to deal with guns. We have to insist on better police training. We have to acknowledge and deal with the links between poverty, injustice, systemic racism, the militarization of urban police forces and crime. On Minnesota Public Radio last year, as he approached his 30th year at the newspaper, Jerry Holt was asked, “What’s your vision for the future of black people in Minnesota?” He said he was optimistic, hopeful, “if we could figure out a way to … [improve] relationships with police officers, so it's safer for police officers and for citizens of all races — but, in particular, African-American men. “I worry a lot about things that are currently going on with that situation, but I am hopeful and very, very optimistic that those things will improve with education and lack of fear of people.” But once again, hope and optimism are strained.

Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now.

Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up.

Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty.

PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0
1621226072,2020-05-30 21:02:38,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.keloland.com/top-stories/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,91060,keloland.com,http://www.keloland.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

The incident happened while the crew from WAVE 3 was live on air, when reporter Kaitlin Rust was speaking about the dozens of officers in riot gear standing shoulder-to-shoulder near Louisville City Hall, according to CBS affiliate WIVB. As she spoke to the station's anchors, she can be heard yelling, ""I've been shot!"" repeatedly. The videographer captured an officer directly pointing the gun at their team.

The statement said both Rust and Dobson were very visibly television professionals. Rust was wearing a ""bright yellow, reflective vest,"" and had a large field microphone, while Dobson had ""an apparently very visible, professional-grade field television camera.""

""We strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer who tonight repeatedly fired at and hit our reporter and cameraman, both of whom were courageously and lawfully covering breaking news in their community,"" they said. ""There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances."" LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay told the Courier-Journal that it is unclear if the officer who shot the pepper bullets were from the LMPD. She apologized for what happened, saying it's ""not our intention to target or subject the media as they try to cover this."" ""It's not something that should have occurred if she was singled out as a reporter, and that is what the video looks like occurred. It's a little difficult to determine, in the midst of all of this, who that officer is,"" Halladay said.

Demonstrations were held in Fargo, Bismarck, Bemidji, Rochester, Willmar and Duluth, among others. A protest also was planned to take place later Saturday evening in East Grand Forks. In Fargo, there was a 2,000-person march through the city. Demonstrators chanted “I can’t breathe” – three of Floyd’s dying words – plus a call-and-response: “What’s his name? George Floyd!” “We are not looked upon as human beings. We are looked at as people who were once property,” organizer Ritchell Aboah, who’s also a candidate for Fargo City Commission, told demonstrators as they organized Saturday morning. “We are tired of injustice. We are tired of crying. Now it is our time, and we ask that everyone stand with us.” Some city leaders, including Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney and Moorhead Mayor Jonathun Judd, met with demonstrators. Mahoney joined a “black lives matter” chant outside police headquarters and Judd filtered through the crowd. Other Fargo officers held or posed for photographs next to signs that read “one race ... the human race!” and “justice for George.” Late Saturday, the city of Fargo declared a state of emergency because of the protests and instituted a 10 p.m. curfew. In Bismarck, about 300 people carried signs and chanted as they marched a loop through the city and occasionally blocked traffic. Opie Day, a 44-year-old citizen of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa who moved to Bismarck from the Twin Cities, led a drum group beforehand. “Not being able to be home in person, this is my way of contributing and letting them know that I’m with them,"" Day said. He also said he has been pulled out of cars and off of buses by law enforcement, which he believes is a product of his skin color. In Duluth, about 1,000 people gathered for a similar demonstration at the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which commemorates the three black men who were lynched on that spot by a mob in 1920. Organizers there held a similar protest on Wednesday, which drew more than 100 people. City officials later set a 10 p.m. curfew in Duluth. In Bemidji, between 300 and 400 marchers headed from the city’s iconic statues of Paul and Babe – which briefly became a racial flashpoint when someone painted “genocide” on the ox’s flank in early 2019 – to the Bemidji Police Department’s headquarters about half a mile away. ""The virus of racism is passed down from mother to daughter, from father to son,"" David Frison, a Bemidji State University professor, told marchers. ""When liberty is denied to all citizens, we can't breathe, America."" And in Rochester, more than 100 people marched through the center of the city, chanting “I can’t breathe” like their counterparts across the region. On Friday night, demonstrators there blocked Hwy. 52 and a few other downtown intersections. They ultimately broke a few windows, including one on a police cruiser. Civic leaders have instituted a 9 p.m. curfew on Saturday in the city’s core. But, other than a few thrown water bottles in Bismarck, the demonstrations in Rochester and Bemidji were the only ones outside the Twin Cities that reported any violence. Both instances were minor by comparison. In Bemidji on Saturday, demonstrators began roughing up a school resource officer’s truck and, as organizers pulled them back, a police officer hopped into the truck and backed it through some of the demonstrators as he drove away. It was not immediately apparent if any demonstrators were injured, and organizers and police officers shook hands after the confrontation. Saturday afternoon, the city of Bemidji announced an 8 o'clock curfew for Saturday evening. The marches and protests across Greater Minnesota have been smaller and more peaceful than those in the Metro, where Floyd’s killing has meant days of demonstrations that have sometimes turned to violence, including the takeover and burning of a police precinct and the ransacking of dozens of businesses, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to order the largest-ever mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard on Saturday. No one has died in the widespread protests there, but demonstrators, police and journalists all have reported myriad injuries. The protests also have turned toward looting and arson, and state and city leaders suggested on Saturday that the Twin Cities demonstrations have been joined by out-of-state agitators. About 15 protesters walked in and around downtown Willmar with signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice For Floyd,” and “I Can’t Breathe,” the words Floyd spoke moments before his death Minneapolis, St. Paul and a multitude of surrounding suburbs instituted an 8 p.m. curfew on Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Transportation also announced major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities would close at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Sunday.

1621306338,2020-05-31 00:28:00,Twin Cities brace for a 'long night' authorities projecting an early handle on unrest,https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/crime-and-courts/6514100-Twin-Cities-brace-for-a-long-night-authorities-projecting-an-early-handle-on-unrest,en,False,,32194,mitchellrepublic.com,http://www.mitchellrepublic.com#spider,"ST. PAUL — In the early hours of Sunday, May 31, officials said Minnesota law enforcement have gotten a hold on the Twin Cities' days-long string of riots, stealing and arson fires. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told reporters at 1 a.m. Sunday that residents can ""rest a little easier"" after officials substantially beefed up police and National Guard presence and operations Saturday. The increased policing came following four days of protesting 46-year-old George Floyd's death in police custody on Monday night. While some protests remained peaceful, many sparked confrontations between demonstrators and police. Incidents of violence, looting and arson began cropping up around the metro, some of which officials pin on potential outside criminal groups intent on causing more mayhem. Early Sunday, Schnell said public safety officials do not see themselves as ""out of the woods"" yet, but things were better off in the hours prior to a 1 a.m. press conference than earlier this week. Most of the groups that officers intercepted were smaller than in previous nights, he said -- between five and 20 people each. He also said earlier Saturday that officers successfully scattered a group congregating near the Minneapolis Police Department's 5th Precinct. Officials did not immediately have available updated arrest numbers. Schnell said the number was ""in the dozens,"" but added that the booking process has taken longer than usual. Many of the arrests as of late Saturday were for curfew violations, though a tweet from the state Department of Public Safety said that it arrested several individuals for gun violations. Schnell said he was not positive of the exact number of additional officers out patrolling the Twin Cities Saturday night, but said the number was ""in the hundreds."" He also gave credit to Saturday night's relative return to normalcy to residents' ""incredible levels of compliance"" with Saturday night's 8 p.m. curfew, as well as a commitment to protecting their neighborhoods. Whether to extend the curfew beyond Saturday night is left to Gov. Tim Walz and local officials, he said. ""Do I think we’ve made progress tonight? Yes. Do I think we will have a better sense as we get into this tomorrow? Yes,"" Schnell said. ""Ultimately, the goal is to restore the situation to a point where regular, normal police operations are adequate."" Hours earlier, Walz told reporters that Minneapolis and St. Paul were in for a ""long night,"" and was followed by other state officials who projected a sense of early optimism over their grasp on the situation. Local, county and state public safety agencies reported fires and arrests in different parts of the cities throughout the night, but Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, head of the Minnesota National Guard, said late Saturday that the service branch was ""in a position of strength."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed several major interstates and highways into the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday. Walz earlier Saturday order a full mobilization of the Guard, the first in its history in Minnesota. Guard news releases indicate that approximately 2,500 airmen and soldiers are assisting local authorities this evening. An additional 7,000 to 10,000 may be deployed. Per an executive order Walz signed Saturday, public safety departments from jurisdiction are adding to the numbers of local ones already at work. Schnell and other officials stressed, however, that the night was still young. ""Some of the groups that are here are in it for the long haul,"" he said. Prior to nightfall, demonstrators struck a mostly peaceful tone on Saturday. Officials have expressed support for such protests and have gone as far as to condemn the nature of Floyd's death outright. Floyd, who was black, died Monday evening following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired this week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz and others have decried the act as a murder, and a protest that started in Minneapolis briefly boiled over in neighboring St. Paul this week before spreading to other U.S. cities. Amid the calls for justice reform, however, are widespread reports of destructive behavior. But many communities have rebounded to clean up battered storefronts and buildings under the light of day. Government officials at the state and local level, including Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, have said repeatedly now they have reason to believe that groups from outside the region and with ties to organized crime may be responsible for looting and riots that were carried out amid protests over Floyd's death in recent days. State and city officials have been evasive, however, about the source and validity of the intelligence that suggested outside groups are infiltrating demonstrations. Walz said that he still believed the intelligence to be credible but left open the possibility that information collected during arrests made tonight may ultimately suggest otherwise. A message sent to the DPS requesting more information on claims of outside actors was not immediately returned. In anticipation of further unrest, more and more local business owners throughout the metro area have responded by boarding up shop throughout the Twin Cities area before nightfall. Major highways leading into the cities were scheduled to close to through traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Though criticism has been leveled at the law enforcement response to this week's more violent events, officials insisted that Saturday night would be different. In addition to a heftier police presence on the ground, Walz said that airborne surveillance methods would be used as well.",0.0

The protest was one of dozens nationwide over the death of George Floyd. The videos show dozens of protesters gathered in a street holding up a small barricade, appearing to stop an NYPD SUV from continuing to drive. A bag is seen to be thrown on the car as protesters throw objects at the vehicle. Seconds later, a second NYPD vehicle approaches, and drives through part of the crowd, directly hitting at least half a dozen people. As it drove through, the initial vehicle hit the gas and rammed through the people who were standing in front of it, causing several people to collapse on the ground. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the vehicles in the video were ""trapped"" and that the crowd was throwing bricks and rocks, and that there was a bag on fire sitting on top of one of the vehicles. The source said the officers did not ""ram"" the protesters, but that they were ""trying to go forward and escape."" At a late-night news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the video, saying that although it was ""upsetting,"" it's also ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" ""That's wrong on its face,"" de Blasio said. ""I'm not going to blame officers who are trying to deal with absolutely impossible situation ... If a police officer is in that situation, they have to get out of that situation. The video was upsetting, and I wish the officers hadn't done that, but I also understood that they didn't start the situation."" No further information was provided when asked about the second vehicle that approached the crowd and clearly drove through a group of people. The bag thrown on top of the vehicle in the video does not appear to be on fire. Following the release of the video, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on de Blasio to bring the officers involved to justice, and not dismiss the case with ""internal reviews."" ""NYPD officers just drove an SUV into a crowd of human beings. They could've killed them, & we don't know how many they injured.

The splinter group of protestors walked to the Public Safety Building to stage a separate demonstration. One man in this group reportedly was interfering with traffic flow on New York St. and putting himself and others in danger. Rapid City Police Officers asked him to leave the roadway, but Medina said the man refused to comply. He was taken into custody at that point and has been placed under arrest with charges pending.

(Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family) ""For nine minutes and 27 seconds, my nephew begged for his life.” Selwyn Jones’ nephew, George Floyd, died in police custody Monday in Minneapolis after an officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes while Floyd laid handcuffed on the street. A bystander video shows that Floyd yelled out multiple times that he couldn’t breathe, and the footage sparked national protest, including a demonstration set in Rapid City which Jones plans to attend this weekend. The four officers involved in the case have been fired as the incident remains under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement. Derek Chauvin, the officer shown in the video kneeling on Floyd's neck, was charged Friday with third degree murder. “It’s pretty bad when you wake up and see (that) video in the news,” said Jones, a 54-year-old man from Gettysburg, South Dakota. “I’m thinking, 'Wow, not again.' Then my wife looks at me and says, 'You know who that is?'” Selwyn Jones is the uncle of George Floyd. He lives in Gettysburg South Dakota. (Photo: Submitted) As he continued to watch the video, Jones realized his nephew was the man under the officer’s knee crying for help. “The thing that disturbs me the most is hearing him call for my sister,” Jones said. “He starts calling for my sister and (his) mama because he probably knew that he was going to go away.” ‘He was always smiling’ Jones said he wants people to remember his nephew Floyd as a kind, gentle man who loved basketball and bodybuilding. “He always had a smile on his face,” Jones said. “He was always smiling and laughing.” Floyd, 46, had three children, Jones said, one of whom was a 6-year-old daughter still living in Houston with her mother. He moved from Houston to Minneapolis in 2014 to get “a change of direction in life to grow,” Jones said. Floyd was a star football player in high school, earning the nickname “gentle giant” for his 6’7 stature and his love for bodybuilding. Floyd also earned a basketball scholarship to a community college in Florida and went on to play on a club team known as To God Be The Glory Sports. More: George Floyd protests erupt across nation Floyd worked five years as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis and lost his job during Minnesota’s stay-home order. He also drove trucks and briefly worked security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. Jones lived in Rapid City for 20 years before moving to Gettysburg three years ago where he owns a motel. He said he was very close with Floyd and visited him in Minneapolis very often. Jones’s birthday was May 22, and he remembers Floyd texted him to wish him a happy birthday, the last communication they shared together. “George would have given the shirt off of his back” for anyone, Jones said. ‘He didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street’ Jones said it was hard to watch the officer in the video continue to roll his knee on Floyd’s throat. “That’s absolutely horrifying to see someone that’s loved get put into that situation,” Jones said. The video has millions of views, and that’s “millions of people who have seen my nephew get murdered in the streets of Minneapolis, for what reason?” Before moving to South Dakota, Jones grew up in a small town in North Carolina where he said he was used to seeing racism. “We’ve never seen a video of his caliber from start to finish,” Jones said. “He went unconscious because somebody felt some kind of power and control” over Floyd, Jones said. Jones said he is grateful for Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old who posted the video because without her, “none of this would have ever been known.” He said she just happened to be at a nearby bus stop and stayed close to Floyd filming the incident. “I talked to her last night and she said, ‘I can’t sleep.’ I can’t sleep, either. She said, ‘That’s all I can see. I can see your nephew begging, crying and dying at the same time. That’s all I can see: his face,’” Jones said. “Without her, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. She’s an angel. She is my hero right now.” Jones pointed to news reports that state Chauvin has had a history of use-of-force incidents over his career, including involvement as one of five officers placed on leave after they shot and wounded an indigenous man in 2011. “Doesn’t it disgust you to see someone put their knee around another human being’s neck, put their hand in their pocket and pose for the camera while he’s murdering somebody in broad daylight for everyone in the world to see?” Jones said. Mayor Jacob Frey called for Chauvin to be charged Wednesday, making no mention of the other three officers on-scene. “Maybe something will come from this that people stand up and see that this just isn’t right,” Jones said. “To watch my baby nephew suffer like an animal until they put him out of his misery … he didn’t deserve to die in the middle of the street like trash.” Before Chauvin was arrested, Jones said, “I will be at every hearing, every trial, because I’m going to see this one through. I am going to be there when they’re sentenced so I can look them in the eye.” If they do receive jail time, the amount of time they receive “is going to absolutely mean nothing to me, his kids, his nephews, his nieces, his sisters, his brother, because we don’t get to see him and his big smile anymore.” Demonstrations set for Rapid City Jones said many people who are heartfelt about the issue who are rioting in Minneapolis and across the country about Floyd’s death are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones said. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones said he plans to attend a walk in memory of his nephew in Rapid City this weekend, which he said should remain peaceful. The demonstration in Rapid City was first planned by a group of organizers including Shaylene Cordero, Bec Thompson and Jodi Prue, who reached out to him recently to ask if he would join. “She’s an angel,” Jones said of Prue “We need more people like this in the world.” The walk is set for 3 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Park. Jones said he also hopes to schedule a walk in Sioux Falls. Jones said funeral arrangements for Floyd are not yet finalized, but it will likely be closer to family in Houston, Texas. “I don’t know if this will ever change,” Jones said. But as stories of Floyd’s life gain more attention and more demonstrations take place, “I think we have an opportunity to get our word out a little bit farther than ever before.” Read or Share this story: https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2020/05/29/george-floyds-uncle-speaks-out-my-nephew-begged-his-life/5282609002/",0.0

""Our concern is it seems very clear that while some of our folks out there in the streets just crying out to be heard — that they believe that George Floyd should still be alive, that all four of those officers should be held accountable for their actions, and that we have deep soul-searching work to do as a nation to stop this pattern from happening over and over and over again — there also seems to be people in those crowds who are very intent on sparking violence, on breaking windows, on starting fires and on trying to convince those folks to engage in unlawful behavior,"" Carter said on ""Face the Nation."" Carter said advocates in the Twin Cities, including those who are active in the Black Lives Matter movement, don't recognize those in the crowds who are engaging in violence. ""They're seeing people jump out of those crowds to break a window and then go run back in behind those crowds. It's very concerning for me,"" he said, adding that law enforcement partners are working to determine who the agitators are and what their agenda is. Carter said protesters who have incited violence and destroyed businesses are ""drowning out the voices that we need to be hearing"" and overshadowing the need to end police brutality. ""We need to be having a conversation right now about how we stop this from happening. We need to be having a conversation right now about how traumatic it is to our community to see George Floyd killed in the gruesome way that he was, how critical it is that we change the culture of policing for once and for all in our country,"" he said. ""Those who are expressing that anger in a disgusting and destructive way are taking the focus away from what it should be while destroying our community institutions. It must stop."" On Saturday, Carter and other state officials said the majority of those arrested on Friday were from outside Minnesota, but later corrected those figures, saying they were inaccurate and based on flawed arrest data. Wesley Lowery, a correspondent for CBS News' ""60 in 6"" on the streaming platform Quibi, has covered protests and police brutality for years, and said mass demonstrations always attract ""a mixture of people in the streets."" ""The reality is it's always a confluence of people, a confluence of anger and frustration, and it can be too easy for us to think it's just some outside agitator. When you read the after-action reports and the contemporaneous coverage of basically every riot that's ever happened in the last hundred years, the local elected officials always say it's the outside agitators, it's not the people from here,"" Lowery said on ""Face the Nation."" ""We've seen in the last 48 hours the officials in Minnesota claim that, and the independent reporting prove that the vast majority of people arrested were local."" 60 Minutes' Wesley Lowery on racial tensions in America New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday morning also raised the idea of outside forces instigating violence. ""It is a small number of people. It is well organized even though many of the people associate with the anarchist movement and we often think of that as not an example of organization and hierarchy,"" de Blasio said. ""In this case, we've got a lot of people who are organized. They plan together online. They've got very explicit rules. There is an explicit agenda of violence."" Floyd, 46, died last week after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for eight minutes as he pleaded that he couldn't breath. Floyd's death sparked protests nationwide that in some places have turned violent. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder Friday, and the other officers involved were fired. Clashes between law enforcement and protesters in dozens of cities across the country erupted again Saturday, including in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Fifteen states have deployed the National Guard and more than two dozen mayors issued curfews. On Saturday, Attorney General William Barr blamed violent episodes that have occurred on ""far-left extremist groups,"" while President Trump said the incidents were sparked by ""Antifa and the Radical left.""

1621633981,2020-05-31 11:37:34,Majority of those arrested in George Floyd protests and riots gave Minnesota addresses,https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/crime-and-courts/6515335-Majority-of-those-arrested-in-George-Floyd-protests-and-riots-gave-Minnesota-addresses,en,False,,32194,mitchellrepublic.com,http://www.mitchellrepublic.com#spider,"ST. PAUL -- State officials said Saturday, May 30, that a number of outsiders are fueling the destruction and rioting in the Twin Cities, though most of those arrested so far appear to have Minnesota addresses. Gov. Tim Walz estimated on Saturday morning that about 80% of the people causing problems Friday night were from outside Minnesota. Later Saturday, he said, “We’ll find out when this is over. We’ll have a much bigger data set after tonight and we’ll be able to see what’s happening.” Hennepin County jail records and arrest records in St. Paul show the majority of those in custody gave Minnesota addresses. Four of 18 people arrested in St. Paul between Thursday and Saturday at 6 a.m. were from out of state — from Fort Worth, Texas, La Crosse, Wis., Grand Forks and Fargo. Two did not have addresses listed. The rest of the arrests in St. Paul were people from Minnesota: Five from St. Paul Three from Woodbury Two from Minneapolis One from St. Louis Park One from Mankato “The number of arrests we’ve made is a very, very small percent of the people who are out there causing problems,” Steve Linders, a St. Paul police spokesman, said Saturday. “We’ve been focused on protecting people and firefighters so they can protect property. I don’t think you can look at 18 people and say it reflects the total number of people out there causing problems.” Protests have been underway since George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday and unrest has been growing, with rioting, looting and arson being seen. Derek Chauvin, who has been fired from the Minneapolis police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Saturday that as officials make arrests, they are investigating who those individuals are and whether they are associated with any groups. “We have seen things like white supremacist organizers posting on platforms about coming to Minnesota,” Harrington said. He added that officials are also looking into connections with organized crime. Minneapolis arrests The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office provided the following details about arrests from 12:20 a.m. Friday to 11:21 a.m. Saturday, saying 42 of 57 people booked into the jail in connected to protesting gave a Minnesota address: 32 were from Minneapolis or St. Paul 13 were from other metro cities 2 were from non metro cities 10 were from other states/information not provided A Pioneer Press analysis of Hennepin County jail records revealed details about eight arrested who gave addresses from other states. They were: A Miramar, Fla., man, 22 , for burglary A Temperance, Mich., man, 27, for riot A Chicago man, 19, for burglary A Chicago man, 22, for burglary A Sutton, Ark., man, 21, for burglary A Matteson, Ill., man, 47, for possession of burglary tools A Kansas City, Mo., man, 29, for riot An Ames, Iowa, man, 22, was being held on a weapons charge. The rest of those in the jail after protest-related arrests were from other Minnesota cities, including Brooklyn Park, Hastings, Blaine, Burnsville, Lakeville, Big Lake, New Brighton and Inver Grove Heights. ‘Radical elements’ Attorney General William P. Barr said in a Saturday statement that while the outrage about Floyd’s death was real and legitimate, it is also being exploited by agitators. “Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,” his statement said. “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,” Barr continued. “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence. We must have law and order on our streets and in our communities, and it is the responsibility of the local and state leadership, in the first instance, to halt this violence.” Barr also noted that it was a federal crime to “cross state lines or to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting. We will enforce these laws.” Meanwhile, the St. Paul Branch of the NAACP released a statement on Saturday condemning the violence that accompanied protests as a “mockery of our long-standing efforts to create a peaceful society built on mutual respect, justice, and equality for all.” The NAACP said while it supports protesting “as a legitimate way of expressing the community’s sadness, anger, and frustration at the continued and systematic oppression of people of color in Minnesota and throughout our country” it condemns the violence that accompanied the protests.

(AP) — The uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending a peaceful demonstration in Rapid City this weekend, but that he doesn't approve of the violent protests taking place in response to the killing. George Floyd died Monday after a white police officer knelt on his neck. Floyd's death has set off days of violent protests in the Twin Cities and across the U.S. “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Floyd's uncle, Selwyn Jones, told the Rapid City Journal. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones planned to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said he understands the frustration of the people who have been rioting, but that they are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.”",0.0

Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

(KELO) — Protests calling for justice for George Floyd have been happening all across the nation, and South Dakota has joined. “I’m just tired of this violence from police. This needs to stop. I’m tired of not knowing whether our black men and women are going to be able to survive another day or if they’re going to get shot by the people that are supposed to protect us,” protest participant Jordan Borges said. Protests have happened nationwide calling for justice for George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody on Monday. Saturday, people in Sioux Falls gathered to show solidarity. “It’s important that I stand with the efforts to raise awareness about how important this issue is and the fact that, although the incident may have happened in Minneapolis or across the country, it could happen here. And I do feel unsafe because I’m just not certain if an officer, like in Minneapolis, is right here in this community. And it could happen here,” Terry Liggins, a protest participant said. Protestors lined the streets near the intersection of Minnesota Avenue and 41st Street this afternoon holding signs with various messages for Floyd and other people of color who have died. “I think Dr. King says it best. That protests is the language of the unheard. Riots is the language of the unheard. I don’t condone aggression or violence, but people are responding to their pain. We’re missing that part of what’s really happening,” Liggins said. People also held signs showing support for the Black Lives Matter movement. “History shows that black lives are the ones that have been marginalized. Black lives are the ones that have been oppressed. Black lives are the ones that have been enslaved. There’s been a consequence of that generationally and we’re still feeling it today,” Liggins said. “Waking up everyday, not knowing if you’re going to survive, not knowing what somebody’s going to say about your skin tone. Just being taken down and brought down just because of your skin tone. We are all equals. We are all human beings and we are a part of the human race,” Borges said.

PAUL — Saturday night, May 30, came and went with less destruction than Minneapolis and St. Paul saw days before, officials said Sunday, May 31. Fewer people stayed out after a cities-wide curfew to protest the death of local 46-year-old George Floyd, Gov. Tim Walz and local leaders said during a morning press conference. The looting and fire-setting that marked recent nights was less widely observed. Despite that, the officials announced that the 8 p.m. curfew would be extended and re-enter effect Sunday night. And regaining control of the streets, they added, does not mean that Floyd or his family have been served justice, nor does it mean the racism underpinning policing in the area have been addressed. ""We've got a lot of work to do ahead. What's happened to George Floyd,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, ""is etched into the soul of Minneapolis."" Floyd, 46, who was black, died Monday evening, May 25, following a confrontation with police officers responding to a counterfeiting incident reported by a south Minneapolis convenience store. Officers located him inside a vehicle matching one described in the initial call to police. Derek Chauvin, 44, the white officer who a bystander captured on video kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck shortly before he died, was fired last week, arrested and charged with murder in the third degree and manslaughter. Walz, Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter have decried the act as a murder, and Floyd's death set of a wave of anti-police brutality protests that spread from the Twin Cities to other cities across the region and major metro areas in the U.S. While many of the local protests unfolded peacefully, violence and destruction erupted intermittently as unrest boiled over. Dozens of businesses and storefronts, and at least one police station, were ransacked, burglarized and put to the torch, according to public safety agency reports. Local police departments responded with force Saturday evening, augmented by an additional 2,500 Minnesota National Guard airmen and soldiers deployed to the area as part of the service branch's first-ever, full-mobilization effort in the state. Thousands more could be sent in, the Guard has warned. With a tighter grip on and heftier presence in the cities, authorities saw to it that fewer major fires were reported Saturday night. Still, more than 50 people were arrested by 2 a.m. in Minneapolis and St. Paul combined, according to state Department of Public Safety commissioner John Harrington. Many were brought in for gun violations, he said. Forty to 50 more were arrested in the early morning, Harrington added, though arrest records have yet to be finalized. So far, Harrington said that about 20% of those arrested appear to have come from out of state. That does not entirely comport with the message Walz and city leaders gave on Saturday, when they pinned most of the rioting in the area on out-of-the-area groups with potential criminal ties. Walz acknowledged as much Sunday, but said he believed based off official intelligence that bad actors did try to infiltrate some of the more peaceful protests to incite riots. Whether they were tied to white supremacists or far-left groups, as state and U.S. officials have alternately suggested, remains unclear. Calls from lawmakers and Floyd's family members to appoint state Attorney General Keith Ellison as special prosecutor of the case against Chauvin, meanwhile, may yet come to fruition. Walz said his office is examining that possibility but that no decision has been made. Ellison's office had earlier deferred to the governor's for comment.",0.0

Dozens of police units descended on the Empire Mall after protesters began to congregate there and throw rocks at police, according to a Tweet from the Sioux Falls Police Department. Protesters had dispersed as of 11 p.m. The emergency declaration says that curfew is in place from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the entire city of Sioux Falls. It had previously been for the area bordered by 57th Street on the south to 26th Street on the north, Kiwanis Avenue on the east and Interstate-29 on the west, according to the City of Sioux Falls, but was extended to the entire city shortly afterward. ""The only exception during this order is for people going to and from work and seeking emergency services,"" the order said. The protest, which started in downtown Sioux Falls at 4:30 p.m., weaved throughout central Sioux Falls and headed westbound on 41st Street before arriving at The Empire Mall shortly after 9 p.m. Several businesses in the area of the Empire Mall had windows damaged, though protesters were starting to disperse away from the Mall at 10:30 a.m. National Guard activated Gov. Kristi Noem said they welcomed the peaceful protest, but once it turned violent, the South Dakota National Guard was staged and ready to be activated as soon as it turned violent. The National Guard was in downtown Sioux Falls within minutes, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area, Noem said late Sunday night. “Rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” Noem said. Noem said the number of people who traveled to South Dakota on Sunday is unknown. About 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed, she said. Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, she said. They’re in place to secure locations and keep people safe, she said. The Highway Patrol are also located throughout Sioux Falls, but she declined to say how many officers were in Sioux Falls due to security reasons. Other National Guard units are staged and ready to be activated in other parts of South Dakota on Sunday night if unrest occurs elsewhere, she said. The state is prepared for unrest in other cities in South Dakota, but Noem said she doesn’t expect the unrest in Sioux Falls to spread to other cities in the state. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken in a Facebook Live event on the Sioux Falls Police Department page said the events at the mall ""tarnished"" what was supposed to be a peaceful day acknowledging the death of George Floyd and to ""advance the conversation"" around race and violence. ""That is not what’s going to be remembered based on this evening,"" he said. He encouraged parents to get their kids home, saying he was saddened to see so many kids at the mall. ""We have videos of your children committing criminal acts. Your kids need to get home. This is not a joke. This is serious,"" TenHaken said. At the time of TenHaken's statement, he wasn't sure about civilian or police injuries. He reminded the public that a curfew had been enacted and that it would be enforced. ""Get your rear ends home,"" he said. Sioux Falls Police Lt. Jon Thum on scene said there were ""many"" officers hit by rocks and that at one point gun shots went off near TJ Maxx, where protesters had begun throwing things at windows. Situation escalated 'very quickly' The situation ""escalated very quickly,"" TenHaken said, and encouraged people to go home. ""We need everybody to go home,"" he said. ""Remember Sioux Falls is a great city, full of great people. We just need to let this cool down."" “South Dakota hoped for the best but prepared for the worst. We activated the National Guard the minute things turned violent in Sioux Falls,” said Governor Noem. “This is a specialized unit that is prepared for situations like this. We take protection of rights very seriously, including the right to peacefully protest, but rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota. Make no mistake, mob rule and violence do nothing to honor the memory of victims.” The Sioux Falls Police Department tweeted that some protesters were throwing rocks at police vehicles, but an Argus Leader reporter on scene said some protesters were protecting the police. Police also deployed tear gas on the protesters. Protests peaceful earlier in the day A crowd of well over 1,000 protesters weaved through Sioux Falls streets on Sunday night with chats of ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""I can't breathe"" and ""No Justice, No Peace"" after a ""March for George Floyd"" was held. Protesters headed to downtown from the police station and then north on Minnesota Avenue, west on Russell Street, south on Prairie Avenue and south on Minnesota Avenue toward 41st Street.

After 20 minutes at Van Eps Park, protesters moved to the courthouse across the street before ending at the Sioux Falls Police station. The protest was peaceful, and as of 6:30 p.m., parts of the crowd were walking in a separate protest in downtown Sioux Falls.

Journal",http://www.argusleader.com/news/business-journal/,"The City of Sioux Falls issued a declaration of emergency and Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protesters congregated at The Empire Mall on Sunday night. Dozens of police units descended on the Empire Mall after protesters began to congregate there and throw rocks at police, according to a Tweet from the Sioux Falls Police Department. Protesters had dispersed as of 11 p.m. The emergency declaration says that curfew is in place from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the entire city of Sioux Falls. It had previously been for the area bordered by 57th Street on the south to 26th Street on the north, Kiwanis Avenue on the east and Interstate-29 on the west, according to the City of Sioux Falls, but was extended to the entire city shortly afterward. ""The only exception during this order is for people going to and from work and seeking emergency services,"" the order said. The protest, which started in downtown Sioux Falls at 4:30 p.m., weaved throughout central Sioux Falls and headed westbound on 41st Street before arriving at The Empire Mall shortly after 9 p.m. Several businesses in the area of the Empire Mall had windows damaged, though protesters were starting to disperse away from the Mall at 10:30 a.m. National Guard activated Gov. Kristi Noem said they welcomed the peaceful protest, but once it turned violent, the South Dakota National Guard was staged and ready to be activated as soon as it turned violent. The National Guard was in downtown Sioux Falls within minutes, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area, Noem said late Sunday night. “Rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” Noem said. Noem said the number of people who traveled to South Dakota on Sunday is unknown. About 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed, she said. Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, she said. They’re in place to secure locations and keep people safe, she said. The Highway Patrol are also located throughout Sioux Falls, but she declined to say how many officers were in Sioux Falls due to security reasons. Other National Guard units are staged and ready to be activated in other parts of South Dakota on Sunday night if unrest occurs elsewhere, she said. The state is prepared for unrest in other cities in South Dakota, but Noem said she doesn’t expect the unrest in Sioux Falls to spread to other cities in the state. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken in a Facebook Live event on the Sioux Falls Police Department page said the events at the mall ""tarnished"" what was supposed to be a peaceful day acknowledging the death of George Floyd and to ""advance the conversation"" around race and violence. ""That is not what’s going to be remembered based on this evening,"" he said. He encouraged parents to get their kids home, saying he was saddened to see so many kids at the mall. ""We have videos of your children committing criminal acts. Your kids need to get home. This is not a joke. This is serious,"" TenHaken said. At the time of TenHaken's statement, he wasn't sure about civilian or police injuries. He reminded the public that a curfew had been enacted and that it would be enforced. ""Get your rear ends home,"" he said. Sioux Falls Police Lt. Jon Thum on scene said there were ""many"" officers hit by rocks and that at one point gun shots went off near TJ Maxx, where protesters had begun throwing things at windows.

Police also deployed tear gas on the protesters. Protests peaceful earlier in the day A crowd of well over 1,000 protesters weaved through Sioux Falls streets on Sunday night with chats of ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""I can't breathe"" and ""No Justice, No Peace"" after a ""March for George Floyd"" was held. Protesters headed to downtown from the police station and then north on Minnesota Avenue, west on Russell Street, south on Prairie Avenue and south on Minnesota Avenue toward 41st Street. The crowd stretched several blocks at one point, and Sioux Falls Police blocked traffic for them. As of 8 p.m., there appeared to be no major events or altercations.

At the beginning of the protest, chants of ""no justice, no peace"" spread through the crowd. It was interspersed with a ""say his name/George Floyd"" chant. After 20 minutes at Van Eps Park, protesters moved to the courthouse across the street before ending at the Sioux Falls Police station.

1621819033,2020-05-31 19:34:33,Breaking: Truck drives through crowd on I-35W in Minneapolis,https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/crime-and-courts/6515836-Breaking-Truck-drives-through-crowd-on-I-35W-in-Minneapolis,en,False,,32194,mitchellrepublic.com,http://www.mitchellrepublic.com#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS -- An afternoon of peaceful demonstrations across the Twin Cities Sunday was shattered when a tanker truck drove through — or nearly through — a crowd of demonstrators marching on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis. But apparently, it hit none of them, according to authorities, who were unclear of the driver’s motives as of 8 p.m. “Not to have a tragedy and many deaths is just an amazing thing,” Gov. Tim Walz said at 7 p.m., a little over an hour after the incident happened. The driver was mobbed by the crowd, detained for police, who arrested him. After being treated at a hospital for non life-threatening injuries, he was released into police custody. The horrifying and chaotic incident was still being investigated as nightfall approached, heralding the third straight night of curfew and highway closures as the metro area and thousands of law enforcement and National Guard personnel braced for whatever the night might bring. The area is reeling following a week that witnessed widespread and unchecked violence, looting and fires until Saturday night, when the state’s largest-ever assemblage of law enforcement — a militarized force, really — was aided by widespread curfew compliance and seized control of the streets. In a pattern that has played out in cities across the nation, the demonstrations followed by escalating violence began after Monday’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on him. Arsonists’ caches There were signs that those intent on doing harm — and it’s unclear exactly who they are — would try again Sunday. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said authorities continued to discover caches of incendiary materials in vehicles and other places. Some appeared to be days old and were found in areas where fires previously had been set, while others appeared to have been placed within the previous 24 hours. They were associated with a fleet of vehicles, many if not all stolen, that have been stripped of license plates. Harrington said the pattern speaks to sophisticated planning and coordination. 1,500 protesters march from Capitol About 1,500 people who gathered for a large protest at the Capitol in St. Paul on Sunday began marching later in the afternoon and walked onto Interstate 94. They headed westbound for about an hour before they exited. Police described the group as organized and peaceful. After leaving the Capitol, the group used the St. Anthony Avenue ramp to enter Interstate 94 West shortly after 4 p.m. They exited at Lexington Parkway about 5 p.m. to University Avenue and headed east. The protest began at 1 p.m., with people calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed in the case of George Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer was seen on video kneeling on his neck. Derek Chauvin, who was fired from the police department, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Later Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Attorney General Keith Ellis will lead the case. People at Sunday’s protest were also calling for three other officers who were present, and who have also been terminated from the Minneapolis police department, to be arrested and charged. Arrest total: 155 More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. Truck vs. crowd TV aerial video and state traffic cameras showed a disturbing and chaotic series of events before 6 p.m. after a large crowd of marchers had taken to I-35W, which was officially closed at 5 p.m. Harrington said that preliminary reviews of state traffic cameras suggested the driver was already on the highway when crews began closing it. There were no signs the driver ever drove around any barriers, he said. Here’s the full statement by the Department of Public Safety: “Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck.” The 18-wheeler tanker truck drove toward and into the edge of the crowd at what appeared to be swift speed before coming to a halt. The crowd largely appeared to scatter in advance of the truck. The truck did not appear to swerve or veer toward the crowd as it came to a stop. The cab was soon mobbed. Video shows the truck then begin to drive forward again with people on its hood and clinging to both sides of the cab. One of them appeared to break the driver’s front window, and the truck stopped rolling. That person can be seen breaching the cab through the driver’s front window. Immediately following, the crowds fled from the stretch of interstate, which is elevated as it approaches a span over the Mississippi River. Some people could be seen vaulting over guardrails. Police soon swarmed the area. Around 6:20 p.m., a convoy of National Guard trucks, including some with a medical insignia, arrived on the scene. Before the incident, a large crowd of perhaps thousands had been marching and sitting on the bridge in what appeared to be a largely peaceful protest. They arrived there as one of several bands of crowds that had recently left a peaceful protest at U.S. Bank Stadium. Nick Ferraro, Fred Melo and Mara H.

New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores.

Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” George Floyd protests:Records dispute claims that most people arrested came from outside Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection.

""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. Peaceful marches, burning cars:Protests for George Floyd take varying turns “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed.

The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse.

The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Follow this story:For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up to get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” George Floyd protests:Records dispute claims that most people arrested came from outside Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable.

Read the latest update here. Video captured by CBS Minnesota and a webcam shows a tanker truck apparently trying to drive through a large crowd of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis on Sunday night. Officials said the man was arrested and taken to a local medical center with non-life-threatening injuries. Footage shows a tanker truck approaching the throng of people at a high speed, as protesters frantically try to avoid being hit. The truck slowly stops and is then surrounded by protesters who pull open both the driver and passenger doors. The State Police said there was no immediate word of injuries. CBS Minnesota said some 5,000 protesters were on the interstate at the time. The crowd was part of a protest group marching against the death of George Floyd, and demonstrators had taken position to take a knee on the bridge, CBS Minnesota reports. It had been a relatively peaceful protest up until that point.

Police intervened into the tense situation minutes later and could be seen dispersing the crowd with a liquid.

Four Minneapolis officers have been fired and one, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Protests have spread across the state and country, with some turning violent. For the first time since World War II, the National Guard was fully activated in response to the violence and a curfew was placed on the Twin Cities.

PAUL -- More than 155 people were arrested on Saturday night and Sunday as law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard changed tactics after several nights of arson and looting in the Twin Cities. Based on intelligence gathered by law enforcement and with the cooperation of community members, the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center “deployed fast-moving teams to targets that were of high value and high probability of attack,” according to a statement from the Department of Public Safety. Thousands of officers from the National Guard, Minnesota State Patrol, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and local law enforcement worked on the strategy. There has been unrest in the Twin Cities since George Floyd, 46, died on Monday after a Minneapolis officer pinned him with his knee by the neck. The officer has since been charged with murder. “We prepositioned staff so they would be immediately adjacent and told them ‘get there fast,’” said Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. “Speed was of the essence to stop the violence and criminal activity.” People were arrested on suspicion of curfew violation, weapons possession, narcotics possession and rioting, according to DPS. The State Patrol confiscated seven firearms and the Minneapolis Police Department recovered five firearms. St. Paul police officers stopped several vehicles without license plates and “within those vehicles were tools that could be used for destructive purposes,” according to a DPS statement. St. Paul police arrested 15 people between Saturday and early Sunday; the number doesn’t reflect all the arrests in the city, but only those made by St. Paul officers. Seven had St. Paul addresses, four had Minneapolis addresses, and one each were residents of Blaine and St. Michael in Wright County. Two had unknown addresses. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office reported 73 people were cited and released for curfew violations — 50 had Minnesota driver’s licenses, five had California driver’s licenses, two had Colorado driver’s licenses, and one each had licenses from Florida, Illinois, South Dakota and Texas. Information about the addresses of the others couldn’t be confirmed. There were 52 protest-related arrests in Hennepin County — 22 on suspicion of riot, 20 for failing to comply with a peace officer, five for weapons, two for assault, one for assault and weapons, one for burglary and one for curfew violation. Forty-one of those arrested listed a Minnesota address. Of the others, four listed a Wisconsin address, two an Iowa address and one each from Oregon, Nebraska, North Dakota, Illinois and Australia.

At the earlier rally, KSFY-TV reported that Floyd's uncle, Selwyn Jones of Gettysburg in central South Dakota, had traveled to join the march and urged protesting in the ""most peaceful way possible."" He told the station that the people walking with signs for his nephew would have put a smile on his face. He described his nephew as a ""big, gentle giant"" with an infectious smile.",0.0
1621986016,2020-06-01 01:30:00,Violence Escalates As Protests Over George Floyd Death Continue,https://listen.sdpb.org/post/violence-escalates-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,en,False,,116405,sdpb.org,http://sdpb.org/,"Updated 2:25 p.m. ET Protesters staged large-scale demonstrations across the country on Sunday, expressing outrage at the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and, more broadly, anger at police brutality. Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.""

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls. NPR's Gerry Holmes contributed to this report. : 6/03/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said the truck drove into the crowd while westbound on Interstate 35.

A city-wide emergency declaration was issued this evening after protests broke out in Sioux Falls tonight in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Monday, May 25. A curfew was set in place from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the entire city. Demonstrations have been growing across the country all week. In a statement earlier today, Governor Noem sent out a warning to those who might choose to protest in South Dakota. “Make no mistake, mob rule and violence do nothing to honor the memory of victims. If asked, the State stands ready to assist local authorities to ensure everyone’s rights are protected. Rioting and looting, like we’ve seen in other cities and states, will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” said the governor. Noem was true to her word tonight. In a late news conference she said, “Within minutes of the city requesting help, they were on the ground in downtown Sioux Falls, securing that location so that local law enforcement and highway patrol could move to the mall and deal with the situation that was going on, and their role is to step in and do that when violence started.” According to Noem, 70 Guard members were deployed from the 114th Fighter Wing and the 235th Army Guard, who are trained as military police. “This is a specialized unit that’s prepared for situations like this. I commend the local law enforcement, the Highway Patrol, and the Guard for being prepared and for acting quickly to take control of the situation at the mall.” In the news conference and in her earlier statement, the governor reiterated her belief that her administration supports the right to protest. “We take the protection of people’s rights very seriously, as we’ve demonstrated over the last several months, including the right to peacefully protest.” Authorities are gathering information as to whether the protesters were from South Dakota or came in from other communities. The number of arrests is not known at this time.",0.0

Chiara de Blasio was at a protest in downtown Manhattan. The New York Post obtained an arrest report saying she refused to leave a Manhattan street that officers ordered cleared because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. It was one of hundreds of arrests at protests in the city over the weekend, CBS New York reports. The demonstration Chiara attended was among countless ones around the country over the fatal arrest of George Floyd. While many other cities have imposed curfews in response to protests, Bill de Blasio has insisted New York doesn't need one. At the press briefing, De Blasio praised police for showing ""restraint"" Saturday evening. But he also criticized the actions of some officers he said showed ""a callous disregard for fellow New Yorkers."" ""I didn't like what I saw one bit. I never want to see something like that. I don't want to see anything like that again. We need to do a full investigation and look at the actions of those officers and see what was done, why it was done, how it could've been done differently,"" the mayor said. ""But I also want to emphasize that situation was created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle, a tactic that we had seen before in the last few days, a tactic that can be very very dangerous to everyone involved.

An hour before an 11 p.m. curfew ordered by Mayor Muriel Bowser, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. Fire is set and U.S. flag burned during protest near White House on May 31, 2020 over death at police hands of George Floyd in Minneapolis the week before.

Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, ""Who do you serve? Who do you protect?"" Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. CBS News confirmed that President Trump was briefly brought to the White House bunker Friday night after protests erupted near the White House. The Palm Beach Post reports that the demonstrations outside the White House spurred additional security measures outside the president's Mar-a-Lago resot in Palm Beach, Florida. Back in Washington, there was a fire Sunday night in the headquarters of the AFL-CIO. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. Among the fires was one in the basement of the historic St. John's Episcopal Church. It was quickly extinguished by firefighters who arrived under police escort, according to The Washington Post. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was activated to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Paul, 23, has been charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly, the Scottsdale Police Department announced Thursday. Police said they received ""hundreds"" of tips and videos identifying Paul as a participant in the demonstration at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall on Saturday. Police said Paul was present at the mall after the protest was declared an unlawful assembly and ""rioters"" were ordered to leave. He also illegally entered the mall when it was closed. In response, Paul tweeted Thursday, ""gimme my charges and let's put the focus back on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter."" gimme my charges and let’s put the focus back on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter https://t.co/nwBZmsxFFz — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) June 4, 2020 Paul denied that he ""engaged in any looting or vandalism"" despite being seen with friends on video as people around them appeared to be damaging property. Demonstrators all over the country continued to protest the death of George Floyd over the weekend, calling for an end to police violence. ""To be absolutely clear, neither I nor anyone in our group was engaged in any looting or vandalism,"" Paul said in a statement Sunday. He claimed that he and his friends ""spent the day doing our part to peacefully protest"" Floyd's death and claimed they were tear-gassed for filming the protests. ""We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighborhood we traveled through; we were strictly documenting, not engaging,"" he added. ""I do not condone violence, looting or breaking the law."" Paul said he understands the ""anger and frustration that led to the destruction we witnessed."" Multiple videos showing Paul and his group at the Arizona mall surfaced on Twitter late Saturday and into Sunday morning. New York Times Reporter Taylor Lorenz was one of many who shared the viral videos on the platform. She claimed the footage showed Paul and his friends ""'looting' and trashing property in a Scottsdale mall last night amid protests."" Much of the footage appears to be Instagram stories posted by Paul's photographer/videographer, Andrew Blue. Blue also put out a statement on his Instagram stories denying their party took part in the alleged looting or vandalism. The viral videos appear to show Paul walking around both the outside and the inside of the mall wearing a white face mask with a red stripe. Multiple people are seen on camera damaging the property, walking into stores and running around. The footage doesn't clearly show if Paul did or didn't participate in the alleged vandalism or take anything from the businesses. Paul is no stranger to public incidents and viral moments.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry - boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. Demonstrators protest near White House on night of May 31, 2020 after death of George Floyd during arrest in Minneapolis earlier in week. Getty Images  A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard - roughly 1,700 soldiers - was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for ""overwhelming force"" against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Mr. Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades, a senior administration official confirmed to CBS News. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. That account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the Floyd killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts and blocking highways to breaking curfews. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" Yet thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying they weakened calls for justice and reform. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it ""really shocking to watch."" In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. ""We're not done,"" said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a recent string of racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit, Minneapolis, Omaha and Louisville in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Mr. Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said.",0.0

Read the latest update here. A man in Louisville was shot and killed by police just after midnight Monday morning, CBS affiliate WLKY-TV reported. Officers said they were fired at before opening fire. It came on a night when demonstrators protested over the death of Breonna Taylor as nationwide protests continued over the death of George Floyd. Police said they were trying to clear a large crowd in a parking lot, WLKY reported. The victim's family identified him as David McAtee, WLKY reported. Louisville Chief Steve Conrad said Louisville police and the National Guard were breaking up a large group there when someone fired a shot at them. Law enforcement then returned fire. The station reports that an onlooker said people at the scene weren't protesting and were just ignoring the city's curfew. It wasn't clear whether the dead man was a suspect in what authorities said was the initial gunfire. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has called on Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the shooting. He held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there is significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. Beshear is calling on all of it to be released quickly. ""I'm not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,"" Beshear said. The station reports at least 40 people were arrested at demonstrations in Louisville Sunday night. Louisville was home to Taylor, who was in bed with her boyfriend when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door in March. Gunfire erupted and Taylor was killed. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Breonna Taylor Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no-knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely.",0.0

(KELO) — The words “Justice for George Floyd” and “No Justice. No Peace,” rang through downtown Sioux Falls as protestors marched. “I think it’s important that, in a city like ours, where you don’t have a lot of law enforcement violence on citizens, it’s definitely still a good thing to come out and protest and have our voices heard for those that aren’t as fortunate as we are here,” Ahmed Bushra, a protest participant said. Organizers want to peacefully support the Black Lives Matter movement and call for an end to police brutality. “I’m born and raised here, he’s not, but to see all those people and to see all the support, it’s amazing. It’s overwhelming, it’s like something that you can’t describe,” protest participants Skylar and Sean Fisher said. The city and police worked with organizers to help make this happen. “We’re looking for empathy. We understand that there are good police officers, I’ve had chances to interact with them, it’s been fantastic. But understand that it’s not just a few bad apples, it’s a systemic issue,” Bushra said. Danielle Koang tells KELOLAND News that another protest had been planned, but organizers decided to cancel that one for fear of violence. “Originally I was going to go to that one, just because I did feel like siding with the police kind of defeats the purpose of protesting the police. So when that one got cancelled, I decided I’m still going to come to this one because they both support the exact same movement,” Koang, a protest participant said. Protestors want to not only show their support, they want to bring an understanding to Sioux Falls about the unrest the nation is feeling right now. “The Black Lives Matter movement is not at all dismissing the lives of police officers. It’s not dismissing the lives of every other race. It’s simply stating the fact that Black Lives Matter as well and that we should be treated like we are valued as well. I want everybody to understand that just because there aren’t as many police brutality cases here in Sioux Falls or in South Dakota as a whole, it’s just as important that we speak up as well. It’s important that everybody else in the nation knows that we’re standing with them and that we see them and we hear them,” Koang said.",0.0

(KELO) – Sunday was an emotional day for Sioux Falls as thousands gathered to protest peacefully calling for justice for George Floyd and calling for an end to racism. However, as that event ended and the sun began to set, things took a turn as rocks and glass bottles began being thrown at police officers and the Empire Mall began being vandalized. Early Sunday night, thousands gathered for a peaceful protest honoring George Floyd and calling for an end to police brutality. Vaney Hariri, a civic leader and co-founder of Think 3D Solutions spoke at the march. “We talked about managing anger. As a person of color who’s been angry for a lot of their lives because of our personal experiences, I don’t want to be angry. I want to be safe. I don’t want to be angry, I want to be respected. I want to be appreciated, I want to be valued,” Hariri said. That march began at Van Eps Park then moved its way to the courthouse and ended at the police department. Afterwards, protestors continued to take to the streets separately from that peaceful protest. As the sun went down, reports of vandalism and violence began near the Empire Mall. “A lot of those were young folks and we don’t know what the motives were for why they were doing what they were doing. I’d imagine that some of them may lack the maturity and understanding and realize that they were setting what we were trying to do back. But ultimately, they’d only be setting it back if people allow it to be,” Hariri said. As Sioux Falls wakes up this morning, Hariri hopes everyone can focus on the peaceful protest that did happen and not the one that happened late last night. “Both of those ones are fires, right, those are fires that are burning. One with passion, one with anger. Whatever one you choose to put your log on, that fire is going to burn brightest. If that is where you put your energy, that is the fire that will burn brightest. Why would you put your energy to that? Put your energy to the one that is your brothers and sisters and your neighbors and your community that’s trying to tell you that they are passionate, fired up and ready to go to do something to take us to the next level in terms of what we can be as a community,” Hariri said. The organizers of Sunday’s peaceful protest had worked with the city of Sioux Falls and the police department.",0.0

(KELO) – What began as a peaceful protest for most of Sunday evening turned violent later that night. “People were getting increasingly hostile toward us as we were facilitating their march and blocking intersections and… allowing them to express what they needed to express,” Sioux Falls Police Department Lieutenant Jon Thum said. Violent protesters began hurling rocks at business in and around the mall. When Lt. John Thum and his fellow officers tried to stop them, they also became targets. “We got hit by a lot of rocks. We have an officer who may have a broken hand… another one got hit in the throat, I think. Numerous more were hit, thankfully with protection,” Thum said. But not all protesters showed them that hostility, as some actually came to their aid. “The initial onslaught, a group of protesters did amazing work by linking arms in front of us and trying to stop what was happening,” Thum said. Unfortunately, Thum says it didn’t work. Eventually more officers arrived on scene deploying tear gas to try and detain the situation. “I’m extremely grateful for the group, and I know later, as gas got deployed, they may not understand that we didn’t intend that for them but we simply had to take action,” Thum said. Deputies from the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office and Highway Patrol eventually came to back them up – bringing almost 100 officers to the area. “They came and stood shoulder to shoulder with us and helped us when we needed it and made the difference for us,” Thum said. While it was a disappointing end to what was a peaceful protest, Lt. Thum and his fellow officers are still remaining hopeful. “Before tonight started, we were like, ‘You know, we’re Sioux Falls. We’re going to show everybody how we can do it. We’re going to show everybody how it’s done… and I still believe we can do that. I still believe we can come together. If we don’t at least start locally, start with the relationships we built and everything great we have going for us with our relationship with the community, we’ve worked really hard to build that and that’s got to count,” Thum said.",0.0

(By The City of Sioux Falls issued a declaration of emergency and Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protesters congregated at The Empire Mall on Sunday night. Dozens of police units descended on the Empire Mall after protesters began to congregate there and throw rocks at police, according to a Tweet from the Sioux Falls Police Department. Protesters had dispersed as of 11 p.m. The emergency declaration says that curfew is in place from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the entire city of Sioux Falls. It had previously been for the area bordered by 57th Street on the south to 26th Street on the north, Kiwanis Avenue on the east and Interstate-29 on the west, according to the City of Sioux Falls, but was extended to the entire city shortly afterward. “The only exception during this order is for people going to and from work and seeking emergency services,” the order said. The protest, which started in downtown Sioux Falls at 4:30 p.m., weaved throughout central Sioux Falls and headed westbound on 41st Street before arriving at The Empire Mall shortly after 9 p.m. Several businesses in the area of the Empire Mall had windows damaged, though protesters were starting to disperse away from the Mall at 10:30. National Guard activated Gov. Kristi Noem said they welcomed the peaceful protest, but once it turned violent, the South Dakota National Guard was staged and ready to be activated. The National Guard was in downtown Sioux Falls within minutes, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area, Noem said late Sunday night. “Rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” Noem said. Noem said the number of people who traveled to South Dakota on Sunday is unknown. About 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed, she said. Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, she said. They’re in place to secure locations and keep people safe, she said. The Highway Patrol are also located throughout Sioux Falls, but she declined to say how many officers were in Sioux Falls due to security reasons. Other National Guard units are staged and ready to be activated in other parts of South Dakota on Sunday night if unrest occurs elsewhere, she said. The state is prepared for unrest in other cities in South Dakota, but Noem said she doesn’t expect the unrest in Sioux Falls to spread to other cities in the state. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken in a Facebook Live event on the Sioux Falls Police Department page said the events at the mall “tarnished” what was supposed to be a peaceful day acknowledging the death of George Floyd and to “advance the conversation” around race and violence. “That is not what’s going to be remembered based on this evening,” he said. He encouraged parents to get their kids home, saying he was saddened to see so many kids at the mall. “We have videos of your children committing criminal acts. Your kids need to get home. This is not a joke. This is serious,” TenHaken said. At the time of TenHaken’s statement, he wasn’t sure about civilian or police injuries. He reminded the public that a curfew had been enacted and that it would be enforced. “Get your rear ends home,” he said. Sioux Falls Police Lt. Jon Thum on scene said there were “many” officers hit by rocks and that at one point gun shots went off near TJ Maxx, where protesters had begun throwing things at windows. Situation escalated ‘very quickly’ The situation “escalated very quickly,” TenHaken said, and encouraged people to go home. “We need everybody to go home,” he said. “Remember Sioux Falls is a great city, full of great people. We just need to let this cool down.” “South Dakota hoped for the best but prepared for the worst. We activated the National Guard the minute things turned violent in Sioux Falls,” said Governor Noem. “This is a specialized unit that is prepared for situations like this. We take protection of rights very seriously, including the right to peacefully protest, but rioting and looting will not be tolerated in South Dakota. Make no mistake, mob rule and violence do nothing to honor the memory of victims.” The Sioux Falls Police Department tweeted that some protesters were throwing rocks at police vehicles, but an Argus Leader reporter on scene said some protesters were protecting the police. Police also deployed tear gas on the protesters. Protests peaceful earlier in the day A crowd of well over 1,000 protesters weaved through Sioux Falls streets on Sunday night with chats of “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No Justice, No Peace” after a “March for George Floyd” was held. Protesters headed to downtown from the police station and then north on Minnesota Avenue, west on Russell Street, south on Prairie Avenue and south on Minnesota Avenue toward 41st Street. The crowd stretched several blocks at one point, and Sioux Falls Police blocked traffic for them. As of 8 p.m., there appeared to be no major events or altercations. Earlier, speakers addressed a huge crowd at Van Eps Park, the Minnehaha County Courthouse and the Sioux Falls Police Station, voicing their support for George Floyd and pleading for justice amid similar gatherings nationwide. At the beginning of the protest, chants of “no justice, no peace” spread through the crowd. It was interspersed with a “say his name/George Floyd” chant. After 20 minutes at Van Eps Park, protesters moved to the courthouse across the street before ending at the Sioux Falls Police station. The protest was peaceful, and as of 6:30 p.m., parts of the crowd were walking in a separate protest in downtown Sioux Falls.",0.0

(KELO) — Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Monday morning that the violence, vandalism and looting Sunday night was “one of the darkest days in the history of Sioux Falls.” Unfortunately, TenHaken said most of the damage, violence and looting that happened last night was caused by high school and middle school aged students. “These were mostly kids,” TenHaken said. TenHaken said he recognized some suspects from local high schools. “Our city has failed these kids, our parents have failed them,” TenHaken said. TenHaken said he saw kids as young as 13 or 14. Why were those kids out Sunday night at the scene of violence, looting and vandalism, he said. City officials were also contacted by a middle school teacher who recognized some students, TenHaken said.

As of Monday morning, police had already made several arrests, TenHaken said. “We will hold you to account,” Burns said. TenHaken said the city plans to release photos of suspects in order to help the police investigate.

Burns and TenHaken also stressed that the city had two events last night. One was a peaceful demonstration that started at 5 p.m. The other was an event that started around 9 p.m. at the Empire Mall that included the destruction and violence. City police wanted to stand beside those who were in the peaceful protest that started in the downtown near the statue of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Burns said. What happened a few hours later, forced the police force, county deputies and National Guard members to protect property and the public at the Empire Mall while facing confrontation including five-to seven pound rocks being thrown at them, city officials said. Burns said at least two officers received minor injuries. Some squad calls were also damaged by rocks, Clemens said. Although there were reports or rumors about outside agitators being bused to Sioux Falls, Burns said “We don’t know if that materialized.” Burns said police had people watching for any arriving buses or information.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast.

Log in Sign up Become a Member WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has sent to Brazil more than 2 million doses of a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as potentially protecting against and treating the coronavirus, even though scientific evidence has not backed up those uses. No large, rigorous scientific studies have found the drug, hydroxychloroquine, safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19, and some smaller studies have indicated worse outcomes from those taking the drug. Brazil, now Latin America’s hardest-hit country, continues to see a surge in virus cases, and last week Trump announced that the U.S. was restricting travel from the country to prevent travelers from spreading the virus in the U.S. In a joint statement with the Brazilian government on Sunday, the White House said the doses of hydroxychloroquine had been sent to Brazil as a prophylactic for front-line health workers and as a therapeutic for those who may come down with the virus. The White House said it was also delivering 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. Trump revealed in May that he took a two-week course of the drug to protect against the coronavirus, despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for COVID-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects.",0.0

Police then came in force to clear the highway in the city where violence erupted after the death last week of Floyd, who was black.

The Republican governor deployed National Guard troops to the scene of a violent protest in Sioux Falls on Sunday night after stores were vandalized and protesters hurled rocks at police. Her comments came shortly after President Donald Trump told governors in a video conference call they “look like fools” for not deploying more National Guard members to demonstrations across the country. Noem said she would keep the National Guard “pre-staged” nearby protests planned in other cities across the state. “Rioting and looting will not be tolerated,” she said. The governor said there was a “stark contrast” between the peaceful protest in downtown Sioux Falls and the vandalism that occurred during the night near the city’s largest mall.

The term homicide means only that a person's death was caused by another person. Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged. The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests.

He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.

Kristi Noem said she is open to solutions in light of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and the subsequent protests in the last week. She said on Monday that she has asked her team to find possible legislative changes and called for everyone to find solutions for policies and policing. She said having conversations will put the state on a better path for every resident to have an equal change at success. Noem didn't give specific details of state laws that could be changed, but she said her administration has been considering possible changes that facilitate fairness, law and order and allowing people to have their voices heard. ""We've been having this conversation about race and inequality for decades in this country and a lot of politicians and public figures stand up and talk and frankly, I'm more interested in what we can do,"" Noem said.

Duba said she wants the organizers of Sunday's march to be part of the conversation. She said there's been no talk among legislators about potential changes to state laws since the events in Minneapolis began last week. However, Duba said, state laws are ""only as good as the paper it's written on. It's just words on a page. There's got to be accountability on all sides of the equation and without accountability, we make no change."" National Guard activated Meanwhile, the South Dakota National Guard remains on active status in Sioux Falls after a night of clashes between law enforcement and protesters on Sunday, but the Guard's numbers and locations may change based on actions elsewhere in the state, Noem said. Noem noted that other protests are planned elsewhere in South Dakota and the state plans to be prepared with resources staged like they were in Sioux Falls on Sunday. The full South Dakota National Guard is available to be activated and the assessment is ongoing of where they should be deployed based on skills and equipment, Noem said. Noem activated the South Dakota National Guard in Sioux Falls on Sunday night when protesters began breaking into stores and throwing rocks at police. The National Guard was deployed to downtown Sioux Falls, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area. The National Guard were in place to secure locations and keep people safe, Noem said on Sunday night. Ellis column: On night filled with nervous energy and flashes of violence, disaster was averted About 70 Guard members were in Sioux Falls. Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, according to Noem. Noem said she trusts South Dakotans to do the right thing and the vast majority of residents made the right decision on Sunday night. The peaceful protest on Sunday honored the memory of Floyd while recognizing that everyone needs to take action to ensure people are treated fairly, Noem said. However, that agenda changed on Sunday night, she said. ""Today, the conversation isn't about peaceful protest. It's about the violence that happened last night,"" Noem said. Duba attended the march on Sunday, but saw the clashes between police and protesters unfold on TV. She said the activation of the National Guard was ""probably a good idea."" It was appropriate that Sioux Falls police weren't in riot gear during the march, but riot gear was appropriate during the events in the Empire Mall area later on Sunday night, she said. ""The violence that I saw on TV was upsetting to me and frustrating after the time that I spent for an hour and a half downtown Sioux Falls,"" she said. ""We're better than this, Sioux Falls, and I think a lot of folks who went to clean up showed that we're better than this."" Buy Photo Jeff Halberstadt speaks with Gov.

State vehicles used to bring deaf and hard-of-hearing children to appointments were damaged and those families won't have that service available now, she said. ""These aren't protesters that did these actions last night. These are violent criminals. Do not call them protesters,"" she said. Noem's new riot boosting law goes into effect July 1. Noem said that law involves civil penalties instead of criminal activities and the activities on Sunday night were criminal, she said. She said she supports people's right to peacefully protest, but residents got a ""glimpse"" of what can happen when a peaceful protest becomes violent. ""That was necessary legislation to make sure that we have tools ready when they are required to make sure that we're being fair and just and we're facilitating peaceful protests,"" Noem said. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken thanked the state for the support it provided on Sunday night in the press conference with Noem, Public Safety Secretary Craig Price and Brig. Gen. Russ Walz, the assistant adjutant general of the South Dakota Air National Guard. A ""whole lot of behind-the-scenes legwork"" went on in recent days to ensure the city had proper resources to respond to protesters' actions on Sunday night, TenHaken said. He said Sioux Falls' priority is ensuring that safety continues, but the city is ready to help out other communities in the state if the need arises.

The frustration and anger seen in protests across the country in the last week are the result of past promises for reform going unfulfilled and an ever-growing list of people of color who have been killed by police, according to the ACLU.

Kristi Noem said she is open to solutions in light of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and the subsequent protests in the last week. She said on Monday that she has asked her team to find possible legislative changes and called for everyone to find solutions for policies and policing. She said having conversations will put the state on a better path for every resident to have an equal change at success. Noem didn't give specific details of state laws that could be changed, but she said her administration has been considering possible changes that facilitate fairness, law and order and allowing people to have their voices heard. ""We've been having this conversation about race and inequality for decades in this country and a lot of politicians and public figures stand up and talk and frankly, I'm more interested in what we can do,"" Noem said.

Duba said she wants the organizers of Sunday's march to be part of the conversation. She said there's been no talk among legislators about potential changes to state laws since the events in Minneapolis began last week. However, Duba said, state laws are ""only as good as the paper it's written on. It's just words on a page.

National Guard activated Meanwhile, the South Dakota National Guard remains on active status in Sioux Falls after a night of clashes between law enforcement and protesters on Sunday, but the Guard's numbers and locations may change based on actions elsewhere in the state, Noem said. Noem noted that other protests are planned elsewhere in South Dakota and the state plans to be prepared with resources staged like they were in Sioux Falls on Sunday. The full South Dakota National Guard is available to be activated and the assessment is ongoing of where they should be deployed based on skills and equipment, Noem said. Noem activated the South Dakota National Guard in Sioux Falls on Sunday night when protesters began breaking into stores and throwing rocks at police. The National Guard was deployed to downtown Sioux Falls, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area. The National Guard were in place to secure locations and keep people safe, Noem said on Sunday night.

Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, according to Noem. Noem said she trusts South Dakotans to do the right thing and the vast majority of residents made the right decision on Sunday night. The peaceful protest on Sunday honored the memory of Floyd while recognizing that everyone needs to take action to ensure people are treated fairly, Noem said. However, that agenda changed on Sunday night, she said. ""Today, the conversation isn't about peaceful protest. It's about the violence that happened last night,"" Noem said. Duba attended the march on Sunday, but saw the clashes between police and protesters unfold on TV. She said the activation of the National Guard was ""probably a good idea."" It was appropriate that Sioux Falls police weren't in riot gear during the march, but riot gear was appropriate during the events in the Empire Mall area later on Sunday night, she said. ""The violence that I saw on TV was upsetting to me and frustrating after the time that I spent for an hour and a half downtown Sioux Falls,"" she said.

""These aren't protesters that did these actions last night. These are violent criminals. Do not call them protesters,"" she said. Noem's new riot boosting law goes into effect July 1. Noem said that law involves civil penalties instead of criminal activities and the activities on Sunday night were criminal, she said. She said she supports people's right to peacefully protest, but residents got a ""glimpse"" of what can happen when a peaceful protest becomes violent. ""That was necessary legislation to make sure that we have tools ready when they are required to make sure that we're being fair and just and we're facilitating peaceful protests,"" Noem said. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken thanked the state for the support it provided on Sunday night in the press conference with Noem, Public Safety Secretary Craig Price and Brig. Gen.

TenHaken, standing in front of a monitor that showed surveillance footage of people breaking store windows and vandalizing police cars, opened with positive remarks about the crowd that gathered at Van Eps Park for a peaceful demonstration. But once a group broke off from that protest and made it to the Empire Mall, he said, ""the day deteriorated into lawlessness."" A rock taken from the scene where unrest unfolded Sunday evening was placed on the podium TenHaken stood behind. He estimated it weighed between five and seven pounds, not unlike others that were thrown at police officers in the mall parking lot. ""There's going to be accountability for what happened in Sioux Falls,"" TenHaken said — and finding the culprits starts with the video, photos and license plates that law enforcement has collected. Some of that evidence will be shared with the public in hopes of finding those who police have not yet been able to identify. ""If you want to do the right thing,"" he said, ""and you know you committed crimes last night, you should turn yourself into the police department."" Timeline: How protests unfolded in Sioux Falls on Sunday night Police Chief Matt Burns said the rioting, violence and looting made for ""a tough night last night in our city."" Police had a detailed plan in place to stand beside the peaceful protesters, and provide a safe space for them to exercise their First Amendment rights, he said. But the night's events ""at a certain point that turned in a dark way,"" Burns said. Only minor injuries were reported among Sioux Falls cops, with Burns noting one struck in the hand by a rock. Several police vehicles were damaged or tagged with graffiti, he said. Buy Photo People face a line of armed police officers shouting ""hands up, don't shoot"" on Sunday, May 31, in Sioux Falls.

One of them had an Omaha address. It wasn't clear how many of the protesters were from out of state. Burns said the police department was aware of rumors that a group of agitators were being bused in from Fargo, which experienced violent demonstrations the night prior, but that appeared to be a ""false flag."" ""We don't know that that materialized,"" he said. The mayor said it's clear the primary suspects involved in the rock throwing, vandalism and looting were teenagers from Sioux Falls. ""I recognize kids on this video,"" he said. ""I saw them wearing shirts of local sports leagues and local high schools."" TenHaken said repeatedly that he was particularly troubled by the involvement of juveniles in the violence, saying that ""we cannot afford to have a lost generation in our city.""

Journal",http://www.argusleader.com/news/business-journal/,"Gov. Kristi Noem said she is open to solutions in light of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and the subsequent protests in the last week. She said on Monday that she has asked her team to find possible legislative changes and called for everyone to find solutions for policies and policing. She said having conversations will put the state on a better path for every resident to have an equal change at success. Noem didn't give specific details of state laws that could be changed, but she said her administration has been considering possible changes that facilitate fairness, law and order and allowing people to have their voices heard. ""We've been having this conversation about race and inequality for decades in this country and a lot of politicians and public figures stand up and talk and frankly, I'm more interested in what we can do,"" Noem said.

(Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) Rep. Linda Duba, a Democrat who represents central Sioux Falls, welcomed Noem's interest in taking a look at potential changes to state laws on Monday. Duba said she wants the organizers of Sunday's march to be part of the conversation. She said there's been no talk among legislators about potential changes to state laws since the events in Minneapolis began last week. However, Duba said, state laws are ""only as good as the paper it's written on. It's just words on a page. There's got to be accountability on all sides of the equation and without accountability, we make no change."" National Guard activated Meanwhile, the South Dakota National Guard remains on active status in Sioux Falls after a night of clashes between law enforcement and protesters on Sunday, but the Guard's numbers and locations may change based on actions elsewhere in the state, Noem said. Noem noted that other protests are planned elsewhere in South Dakota and the state plans to be prepared with resources staged like they were in Sioux Falls on Sunday. The full South Dakota National Guard is available to be activated and the assessment is ongoing of where they should be deployed based on skills and equipment, Noem said. Noem activated the South Dakota National Guard in Sioux Falls on Sunday night when protesters began breaking into stores and throwing rocks at police. The National Guard was deployed to downtown Sioux Falls, which freed up local authorities downtown to respond to the Empire Mall area. The National Guard were in place to secure locations and keep people safe, Noem said on Sunday night. Ellis column: On night filled with nervous energy and flashes of violence, disaster was averted About 70 Guard members were in Sioux Falls. Twenty-six members are from the 114th Fighter Wing of the Sioux Falls-based Air National Guard and 44 members from the 235th Army National Guard, which is a military police unit, according to Noem. Noem said she trusts South Dakotans to do the right thing and the vast majority of residents made the right decision on Sunday night. The peaceful protest on Sunday honored the memory of Floyd while recognizing that everyone needs to take action to ensure people are treated fairly, Noem said. However, that agenda changed on Sunday night, she said. ""Today, the conversation isn't about peaceful protest. It's about the violence that happened last night,"" Noem said. Duba attended the march on Sunday, but saw the clashes between police and protesters unfold on TV. She said the activation of the National Guard was ""probably a good idea."" It was appropriate that Sioux Falls police weren't in riot gear during the march, but riot gear was appropriate during the events in the Empire Mall area later on Sunday night, she said. ""The violence that I saw on TV was upsetting to me and frustrating after the time that I spent for an hour and a half downtown Sioux Falls,"" she said. ""We're better than this, Sioux Falls, and I think a lot of folks who went to clean up showed that we're better than this."" Buy Photo Jeff Halberstadt speaks with Gov. Kristi Noem after damage was done to his business when Sunday's protests turned violent on Monday, June 1, 2020 at Halberstadt's in Sioux Falls, S.D. (Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) Law enforcement was attacked with rocks and business owners were victimized when stores were looted and vandalized, Noem said. State vehicles used to bring deaf and hard-of-hearing children to appointments were damaged and those families won't have that service available now, she said. ""These aren't protesters that did these actions last night. These are violent criminals. Do not call them protesters,"" she said. Noem's new riot boosting law goes into effect July 1. Noem said that law involves civil penalties instead of criminal activities and the activities on Sunday night were criminal, she said. She said she supports people's right to peacefully protest, but residents got a ""glimpse"" of what can happen when a peaceful protest becomes violent. ""That was necessary legislation to make sure that we have tools ready when they are required to make sure that we're being fair and just and we're facilitating peaceful protests,"" Noem said. Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken thanked the state for the support it provided on Sunday night in the press conference with Noem, Public Safety Secretary Craig Price and Brig. Gen. Russ Walz, the assistant adjutant general of the South Dakota Air National Guard. A ""whole lot of behind-the-scenes legwork"" went on in recent days to ensure the city had proper resources to respond to protesters' actions on Sunday night, TenHaken said. He said Sioux Falls' priority is ensuring that safety continues, but the city is ready to help out other communities in the state if the need arises. More: TenHaken: 'There's going to be accountability for what happened in Sioux Falls' ACLU calls for changes On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota called on South Dakota lawmakers and stakeholders to create policies that ""break down the unchecked systemic racism."" The frustration and anger seen in protests across the country in the last week are the result of past promises for reform going unfulfilled and an ever-growing list of people of color who have been killed by police, according to the ACLU. Heather Smith, executive director of the ACLU of South Dakota, said they're troubled by the continued insistence that ""these things don't happen in South Dakota."" Timeline: How protests unfolded in Sioux Falls on Sunday night ""Invariably, people of color in South Dakota face systemic barriers to education, health care, employment and justice,"" Smith said in a statement. There must be real accountability from law enforcement, the legal system and elected officials to move from outrage to healing, she said. ""There must be healing and a fundamental shift in our state's priorities. It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,"" she said.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.”",0.0

COVID-19 cases increased by 41 on Monday for a total of 5,034 cases, according to the South Dakota Department of Health. That doesn’t include people who show symptoms or are asymptomatic but are not tested. A total of 1,533 test results were reported on Monday and the positive rate for coronavirus tests on Monday was 2.7%. The number of coronavirus deaths in South Dakota remained at 62. In Brown County, two new cases were confirmed Monday, pushing the total to 275 with 61 active. One person has died, 13 people have ever been hospitalized and there have been 1,532 negative tests. Of the 164 cases connected to DemKota Ranch Beef in Aberdeen, 134 have recovered, according to Clayton. The state has 1,069 active COVID-19 cases, according to the health department. Recoveries statewide increased to 3,903. The state health department noted 435 total people have been hospitalized during the pandemic, and 87 are currently hospitalized. There have been 40,627 negative tests. Coronavirus patients are occupying 4% of staffed hospital beds in the state while 54% of hospital beds are available, according to the health department. Coronavirus patients are occupying 6% of intensive care unit beds, and 47% of ICU beds are available. Six percent of ventilators are being used by coronavirus patients while 78% of the state’s ventilator capacity is available. The death of a coronavirus patient in the 20-29 age range was reported during the weekend. State Epidemiologist Josh Clayton said the person didn’t have any underlying medical conditions. Beadle County saw the largest increase in cases on Monday with 14 new cases, for a total of 275. Thirty-three of the 83 cases connected to the LSI Jack Link’s facility in Alpena have recovered, according to Clayton. The state is providing support to the company to hold mass testing events for its employees, one of which took place during the weekend and another that’s scheduled for later this week, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said. Mass testing A total of 4,077 nursing home residents and 6,023 nursing home staff have been tested for the coronavirus so far in the state’s plan to mass test long-term care facilities, according to Malsam-Rysdon. About 98% of nursing homes in communities with substantial community spread have completed the mass testing and nearly three-quarters of nursing homes in communities without substantial community spread have completed the mass testing, according to Malsam-Rysdon. The next mass testing will take place at assisted living facilities. Sioux Falls rally fallout It could take up to two weeks for new coronavirus cases to appear that were caused by the virus’ spread during Sunday’s protest in Sioux Falls, health officials said on Monday. More than 1,000 protesters gathered in Van Eps Park and marched through Sioux Falls on Sunday afternoon to support justice for George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. Later in the night, protesters congregated at the Empire Mall, where they broke store windows and threw rocks at police. It takes two to 14 days for a new case to appear and could take upwards of two weeks for new coronavirus cases to appear that are the result of close contact during the protest, Clayton said. There is a risk of a spreading the coronavirus wherever people congregate, Clayton said. People should take precautions of staying 6 feet away from others and wear masks to reduce the chance of the virus spreading, he said. People will also be heading to the polls across South Dakota for the primary election on Tuesday. Clayton said health officials gave guidance on safety precautions at the polls and election officials also reviewed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

PAUL -- Officers arrested 276 people between Sunday and early Monday, mostly for curfew violations, as people have continued taking to the streets over the death of George Floyd. Included in the number were 150 people who were arrested in the area of Washington Ave and Interstate 35W in Minneapolis on Saturday night after the 8 p.m. curfew, after law enforcement said they gave dispersal orders. During the arrests, officials found two bulletproof vests and four handguns hidden in nearby bushes, along with two handguns in people’s backpacks, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. The Minneapolis fire department reported one new fire overnight, which was on the corner of 44th North and Penn avenues. Firefighters also responded throughout the night to several rekindled fires from earlier in the weekend. There were no fire-related injuries reported. In St. Paul, there was no major activity overnight. Law enforcement arrested 21 people for curfew violations in St. Paul — seven at the Capitol and 14 others elsewhere, according to the police department. “Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest,” the Department of Public Safety tweeted Sunday night. “Please go home and stay there.” Sunday was the third night of an 8 p.m. curfew in St. Paul and Minneapolis. There have been peaceful protests since Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody last Monday, but also large-scale looting, arson and other violence. An officer, who has been terminated from the department, was charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death on Friday. Since the Minnesota Multi-Agency Command Center was set up Friday to respond to the unrest, there have been 481 arrests.",0.0

Journal",http://www.argusleader.com/news/business-journal/,"CLOSE As the George Floyd protesters neared the Empire Mall on Sunday night, a new energy began to circulate among the crowd. A nervous giddiness that something inevitable was about to go down. If you’ve ever been involved in one of these clashes, you know it’s a dangerous energy. An energy that can spark a crowd into a mob intent on destruction. I’ve felt this energy twice before: At 1992’s Martin Luther King Day parade in Denver, I watched anger grow as thousands of protesters yearned to break police lines to confront a rag-tag group of white supremacists who were protesting at the state Capitol. After police evacuated the supremacists, the protest erupted into violence. Police in riot gear fired tear gas into the crowds to disperse them. Stores were looted, people attacked. It was a similar story in Seattle, 1999, at the World Trade Organization protest. What started as a protest to confront what organizers believed were the injustices of global capitalism blew up into an orgy of looting and destruction. More: Here's what businesses have reported damage in Empire Mall area And Sunday, as protests sparked violent confrontations across the country in response to Floyd’s death, I could feel that energy start to take hold as protesters neared the Empire Mall. Buy Photo Protesters form a line in front of the Sioux Falls police to protect them from projectiles on Sunday, May 31, 2020 in Sioux Falls, S.D. (Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) For a tense couple of hours, Sioux Falls stood on that precipice. Would the crowd descend into a mob, intent on looting and destroying? Or would the protest dissipate? In the end, it wasn’t pretty, but it could have been a lot worse. Enough protesters turned on those who wanted to make it violent. And good police work applied enough pressure without inflaming tensions more. I had joined several of my Argus Leader colleagues to chronicle the night, walking with the protest south on Minnesota Avenue, and then turning westbound on 41st Street. It was a caravan of people on foot, motorcycles and vehicles. The majority of people appeared to be high school aged or a little older. It was noisy, with honking cars and revved-up engines often drowning out chants. More: TenHaken: 'There's going to be accountability for what happened in Sioux Falls' By this point, the authorized, permitted protest had ended, and this was extemporaneous. But the Sioux Falls police, who normally loathe closing roads for events like races and parades, were letting them have their way. Supporters stood on the sidewalk, taking videos, while others delivered water bottles to those walking. But as we neared the Empire Mall, the celebratory, jovial feel started to turn. At the Eyemart parking lot, about two blocks away from the mall, a group of protesters had words with some bystanders and confronted them. The bystanders escaped in their vehicles as protesters tried to pull them out of their cars. As the mall came into view, marchers started whooping and running toward the parking lot. Vehicles and those on foot streamed into the parking lot. It was a dangerous mix of vehicles and pedestrians. A crowd gathered in front of the north entrance, which was guarded by a handful of police officers. At one point the crowd made a hasty retreat, but then started to drift forward again.

A nervous giddiness that something inevitable was about to go down. If you’ve ever been involved in one of these clashes, you know it’s a dangerous energy. An energy that can spark a crowd into a mob intent on destruction. I’ve felt this energy twice before: At 1992’s Martin Luther King Day parade in Denver, I watched anger grow as thousands of protesters yearned to break police lines to confront a rag-tag group of white supremacists who were protesting at the state Capitol. After police evacuated the supremacists, the protest erupted into violence. Police in riot gear fired tear gas into the crowds to disperse them. Stores were looted, people attacked. It was a similar story in Seattle, 1999, at the World Trade Organization protest. What started as a protest to confront what organizers believed were the injustices of global capitalism blew up into an orgy of looting and destruction.

And good police work applied enough pressure without inflaming tensions more. I had joined several of my Argus Leader colleagues to chronicle the night, walking with the protest south on Minnesota Avenue, and then turning westbound on 41st Street.

His critics, among them NFL players, pointed to the handling of Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protests. In his statement, Goodell said the ""NFL family is greatly saddened by the tragic events across our country"" and the ""protesters' reactions to these incidents reflect the pain, anger and frustration that so many of us feel."" ""As current events dramatically underscore, there remains much more to do as a country and as a league. These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Gooddell added. ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society."" In response, Texans wide receiver Kenny Stills tweeted, ""Save the bulls***."" Stills is one of the few players who continue to kneel on the sidelines during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. ""Shame on you. This is beyond hollow + disingenuous. This is a lie. Your actions show who you are,"" said director Ava DuVernay. ""You've done nothing but the exact opposite of what you describe here. Keep Mr. Floyd's name out of your mouth. Shame on you + the 'consultants' of this travesty of an organization."" ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" tweeted Michael-Shawn Dugar, a reporter with The Athletic. Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since the 2016-2017 season when he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. In 2017, Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid filed a grievance against the league, alleging they remained unsigned because of collusion by owners following the kneeling protest. Reid would later sign with the Carolina Panthers the following year. In February, the NFL and lawyers for Kaepernick and Reid reached a private settlement for an undisclosed sum. Jed York, CEO of the 49ers, tweeted a statement in response to the protests. ""People throughout our country are hurting,"" York said. ""Emotions are raw, and rightfully so. Heinous acts have been committed in recent weeks. Before we are able to realize impactful change, we must first have the courage and compassion as human beings to come together and acknowledge the problem: black men, women, children and other oppressed minorities continue to be systematically discriminated against."" Former NFL player Torrey Smith, who played for the 49ers during the 2015-2016 season, defended York. ""I've had countless conversations with Jed about these issues when I was in SF. I'm grateful for his commitment to the Bay and injustices everywhere,"" Smith tweeted. Reid, who knelt beside Kaepernick, criticized York. ""I see that a lot of y'all think that it takes money to get justice. It does not. It takes money to facilitate injustice. Justice is easy, the system chooses not to give it,"" Reid tweeted. Reid also responded to Smith, who said York supported players' sidelines protests, adding that he never once heard York tell players not to kneel. ""You speak based on your experience and I understand that. However, I can tell you that you never heard him say 'don't kneel' because you never knelt. He begged me not to kneel,"" Reid tweeted.",0.0

""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in the statement, which was shared on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration."" The hall-of-famer's statement comes after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in Minnesota sparked nationwide protests. George Floyd died on Monday after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground, pressing his knee into Floyd's neck. Video of the incident shows Floyd pleading ""I can't breathe."" Four officers involved were fired, and one, Derek Chauvin, is now charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Floyd's death set off protests in Minneapolis that have now spread nationwide. ""I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough,"" Jordan said in his statement, which was released Sunday after several days of unrest. ""I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy, and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change,"" he continues. Jordan added that his heart goes out to the family of George Floyd ""and the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice."" A look at the history of fear of black men in American society He joins a growing list of pro athletes who have spoken out following Floyd's death. Former NFL player Colin Kaepernick shared a statement on social media last week, saying: ""When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction. The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance. We have the right to fight back!"" He is also supporting a legal defense initiative for those he calls ""Freedom Fighters"" in Minneapolis. Kaepernick's football career was sidelined after he began protesting police brutality and racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games in 2016. Last Tuesday, LeBron James shared side-by-side photos of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck and Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem, writing: ""Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you??"" The next day, the NBA star posted a 2014 photo of himself wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words, ""I can't breathe"" following the death of Eric Garner, a black man who repeatedly said ""I can't breathe"" as he was placed in a fatal chokehold by an NYPD officer. They are the same words uttered by Floyd in his final moments last week. Fellow NBA star Stephen Curry took to Instagram to share a statement as well: ""George has a family. George didn't deserve to die,"" Curry wrote. ""George pleaded for help and was just straight up ignored, which speaks loud and clear that his black life didn't matter. George was murdered. George wasn't human to that cop that slowly and purposefully took his life away.""",0.0
1622605646,2020-06-01 15:07:57,George Floyd's family releasing independent autopsy results,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-death-family-independent-autopsy/,en,False,,152133,kotaradio.com,http://kotaradio.com/,"George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died after an officer arresting him pressed his knee onto his neck, died by homicide, according to the results of two autopsies released on Monday — one by the county medical examiner and the other by independent pathologists commissioned by Floyd's family. But the two autopsy reports differed on exactly how the man died. Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation. But the report released later Monday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office said Floyd died of ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression."" The manner of death was ruled homicide, but the office noted that ""is not a legal determination of culpability or intent."" A preliminary autopsy report cited earlier by prosecutors said the county medical examiner's review ""revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation."" Floyd's death has led to widespread outrage, protests and unrest across the nation. The Minneapolis officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The independent autopsy was conducted by Wilson and Dr. Michael Baden. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was also hired in 2014 to conduct the autopsy of Eric Garner, a black man who died when an NYPD officer used a banned chokehold during his arrest. Both Garner and Floyd pleaded with officers that they couldn't breathe before their deaths seen on disturbing videos, and ""I can't breathe"" has become a rallying cry among those protesting police brutality. George Floyd, left, and former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with third-degree murder for Floyd's death. Baden said Floyd died as a result of compression on his neck and back from the officer, which interfered with blood flow and his breathing. ""George died because he needed a breath,"" said Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Floyd's family. ""He needed a breath of air."" The Hennepin County medical examiner's office, however, said Floyd experienced cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by the officer. The county autopsy said Floyd had ""other significant conditions"" including ""arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; [and] recent methamphetamine use."" The office had not previously released the findings pending toxicology reports. But Baden said the further testing wouldn't reveal evidence of compressive pressure on Floyd's neck and back since the pressure would have been released when it was no longer applied. He said large areas of scrapes and abrasions on Floyd's face indicated the force that was used to press him into the ground. Baden also said that he could find no underlying conditions that contributed to Floyd's death, saying he was in good health. In a criminal complaint, Hennepin County prosecutors said Chauvin ""had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was ""non-responsive."" Crump said Floyd's death was the result of that sustained pressure to his neck and the pressure on Floyd's back from other officers holding him down. ""What those officers did, as we have seen on the video, is his cause of death — not some underlying, unknown health condition,"" Crump said. ""George Floyd was a healthy young man."" Crump said Floyd died on the scene. ""The ambulance was his hearse,"" Crump said. Floyd family attorney says charge against officer should be upgraded to first-degree murder Crump said the family understands the ""righteous anger"" of protesters and said they support the people who want to work towards change, but he called the violence ""unacceptable."" He encouraged the community to ""take a breath for justice, take a breath for peace, take a breath for our country, but more importantly, take a breath for George, since he didn't get the opportunity to take a breath."" Another lawyer representing Floyd's family, Antonio Romanucci, said the three other officers involved are also criminally responsible for Floyd's death. All have been fired, but none of the others have been charged. He called those officers ""shameless"" and said they had every opportunity to prevent Floyd's death, knowing that restricting his airway could kill him. The family has called for those officers to be charged, and for Chauvin to face first-degree — rather than third-degree — murder charges. Romanucci also blasted the Minneapolis police department for what he described as a failure to properly train officers about chokeholds and restraint. ""This was a brutal and public display of an eight-minute prolonged death,"" Romanucci said. ""This was the lowest level of human respect and dignity that any community should ever have to endure. What this really was was the weight of the Minneapolis police department on George's neck."" The Minneapolis police department has not responded to requests from CBS News for information about its training.

A nervous giddiness that something inevitable was about to go down. If you’ve ever been involved in one of these clashes, you know it’s a dangerous energy. An energy that can spark a crowd into a mob intent on destruction. I’ve felt this energy twice before: At 1992’s Martin Luther King Day parade in Denver, I watched anger grow as thousands of protesters yearned to break police lines to confront a rag-tag group of white supremacists who were protesting at the state Capitol. After police evacuated the supremacists, the protest erupted into violence. Police in riot gear fired tear gas into the crowds to disperse them. Stores were looted, people attacked. It was a similar story in Seattle, 1999, at the World Trade Organization protest. What started as a protest to confront what organizers believed were the injustices of global capitalism blew up into an orgy of looting and destruction.

Buy Photo Protesters form a line in front of the Sioux Falls police to protect them from projectiles on Sunday, May 31, 2020 in Sioux Falls, S.D. (Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) For a tense couple of hours, Sioux Falls stood on that precipice. Would the crowd descend into a mob, intent on looting and destroying? Or would the protest dissipate? In the end, it wasn’t pretty, but it could have been a lot worse. Enough protesters turned on those who wanted to make it violent. And good police work applied enough pressure without inflaming tensions more. I had joined several of my Argus Leader colleagues to chronicle the night, walking with the protest south on Minnesota Avenue, and then turning westbound on 41st Street. It was a caravan of people on foot, motorcycles and vehicles. The majority of people appeared to be high school aged or a little older. It was noisy, with honking cars and revved-up engines often drowning out chants. More: TenHaken: 'There's going to be accountability for what happened in Sioux Falls' By this point, the authorized, permitted protest had ended, and this was extemporaneous. But the Sioux Falls police, who normally loathe closing roads for events like races and parades, were letting them have their way. Supporters stood on the sidewalk, taking videos, while others delivered water bottles to those walking. But as we neared the Empire Mall, the celebratory, jovial feel started to turn. At the Eyemart parking lot, about two blocks away from the mall, a group of protesters had words with some bystanders and confronted them. The bystanders escaped in their vehicles as protesters tried to pull them out of their cars. As the mall came into view, marchers started whooping and running toward the parking lot. Vehicles and those on foot streamed into the parking lot. It was a dangerous mix of vehicles and pedestrians. A crowd gathered in front of the north entrance, which was guarded by a handful of police officers. At one point the crowd made a hasty retreat, but then started to drift forward again. The planters in the mall parking lot contain stones, and soon there was the unmistakable sound here and there of the police vehicles parked near the entrance getting hit. Night was coming and tensions were getting higher. One young man turned to a girl and said, “Let’s leave.” Buy Photo Two protesters kneel in a cloud of tear gas on Sunday, May 31, 2020 in Sioux Falls, S.D.

But immediately after, another protester jumped in front of the SUV, his arms raised, imploring the crowd not to use violence. That would emerge as a theme of the night: As police reinforcements arrived, protesters would urge fellow protesters not to use violence, and the rocks would stop for a bit. At one point, protesters joined hands and stood in front of the police line, chanting, “Keep the peace.” They did so at great risk. With no protective gear, they exposed themselves to potential injury from flying rocks. More: While some threw rocks at police and The Empire Mall, others pleaded with them to stop Police formed a tight phalanx near the entrance. The arrival of SWAT officers and two armored cars brought more crowd dispersal inventories, including gas and flash-bang grenades. Officers inside the armored vehicles announced that a curfew had been imposed and ordered the crowd to leave. It was slow going, but a steady stream of cars started heading for the mall exits. Officers began expanding their line as protesters retreated. Still, the occasional rock kept coming, and officers used gas and flash-bangs to encourage them to go. In at least one instance, a protester tried to throw a gas canister back at police, but he was met with rubber bullets.

But the officers applied an even mix of patience and incremental pressure. The final pocket of resistance left at around 11:30 p.m., and a riot had been averted. “I thought Sioux Falls was better than this,” one of the officers said. As I made the long walk back to my vehicle, I encountered a handful of businesses that had been vandalized, their windows broken. But by midnight, the traffic on 41st Street and Minnesota Avenue had thinned. It looked more like a normal Sunday night in Sioux Falls, but it had been anything but normal.

Hours before the March for George Floyd rally to honor the man who died while in custody of Minneapolis police a week ago kicked off at Van Eps Park in downtown Sioux Falls, at least two business organizations took to social media to call on their members to prepare for possible riots similar to what is happening across the nation. The Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Sioux Falls, Inc. had received tips from an unnamed sources that protesters from outside of Sioux Falls planned to attend the rally and incite violence.

Chamber president Jeff Griffin said the goal of sharing the information he received was to alert business owners of a potential for the march to devolve into destruction. And when that goal was achieved, the tweet was deleted so he didn't have to dedicate a staff person to ""babysit"" the comment section for unsavory and bigoted responses that had followed. In hindsight, the chamber didn't need to specifically mention Fargo or the potential for outsiders to participate in the demonstrations in Sioux Falls, he said.

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

Chief Matt Burns said Lincoln County Sheriff’s deputies made the arrests. He said most officers focused on protecting property. “When you have a mobile field-force operation, it is imperative that they stay very, very disciplined to the task which they’re applied,” Burns said. “And that was to protect the integrity of that building. But for their actions there and this firm line that they held, we would’ve had that group breach the Empire Mall, and run riot within that structure, with close to 140 stores.” Matt Burns comments Burns said he expects more arrests. Police are reviewing video from bystanders and surveillance cameras to identify people. The violence at the mall came after a larger, peaceful protest in downtown Sioux Falls. People at the mall broke windows and stole items from several businesses. Sioux Falls is one of dozens of cities across the country with protests and violence after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: America's police officers are at the center of a national storm. They are hearing the rage over what happened to George Floyd at the same time they've been tasked with containing the violence. Some have been accused of cracking down on legitimate protesters, others criticized for being too permissive toward vandals and looters. To give us a sense of what the nation's police officers are thinking right now, we're joined by NPR's law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste, who's been talking with his police sources today. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: First, just give us a sense of the mood of the police officers that you're talking to. KASTE: The mood is gloomy. It's tense. And I think it's fair to say that there is some fear I've heard in some of the things I've heard from especially officers who are kind of on the front lines of crowd control and scenes we've seen so much in the last couple of days. There's also kind of a sense of frustration for a lot of officers when they hear what they think - what they perceive to be sort of a note of understanding or the sense that it's acceptable that this kind of violence, this looting and arson accompany these protests - they find that kind of frustrating. SHAPIRO: Are they angry just about the violence or also about the public response condemning the Minneapolis police involved in the death of George Floyd or, in some cases, about the actions of police officers that, you know, wear the badge as well? KASTE: Well, this anger I was talking about is about this violence. To be clear, when it comes to Minneapolis cops in that video, the police - it's actually struck me how unanimous they've been in condemning - from early on, from last week - condemning what they saw in that video. I've heard cops just going off on those Minneapolis police officers, saying they've made it so much harder to be a police officer in this country now. And you know, I was talking about this yesterday with Robert Hollis, who's a police patrol commander in Kent, Wash., which is a very diverse suburb of Seattle. And he told me that as a black man, he felt sick to his stomach watching that video of Floyd. But he also saw some reason for hope in this sort of widespread condemnation he was hearing from this world of policing. ROBERT HOLLIS: Numerous unions, numerous police chiefs are coming out and saying, this is not the type of officer that we want - 'cause I guarantee you five years ago, it would be more of a, let's wait and see what's going on. Let's hold off, wait for all the facts to come out. But this time, it was outcry from the get-go. SHAPIRO: And as an African American police officer, what is his take on the protesters' accusation that the police are inherently racist, that there are unfortunate trends and, you know, that it run through the institution? KASTE: Well, I mean, he took a nuanced approach to this when we were talking about it. You know, he said that policing, by its very nature, changes slowly. But he thinks, also, that in his 19 years as an officer, he has seen substantive improvements. One example he gave is his own department. A few years ago, they still permitted that knee-to-the-neck technique that we saw used on George Floyd. But a few years ago, a trainer said, this is dangerous. And the department banned it. And he also thinks the implicit bias training of just the last few years, the last five or six years has kind of shaped the views of the new generation of leaders inside of police departments, which may be behind this sort of unanimous condemnation we're hearing. But he still said that he understands that when people see something like this case with George Floyd, that they say, if one of you did it, you all did it. HOLLIS: I don't blame them. At the same time, I still would say to those community members, you need to keep working with us, and we want to keep - continue to keep working with you because we recognize that there's a need to change. We're doing our best to try and make those changes. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Martin, as somebody who's been covering these issues since before Ferguson, do you see the same kind of gradual improvement that Commander Hollis is describing? KASTE: There have definitely been policy changes. There's been sort of a change in attitude in departments on how use of force is used and documented. But you know, policing is a patchwork in this country. There's some talk now about changing the rules under which police can be sued. SHAPIRO: OK. KASTE: That's something that Congress is now maybe picking up the next few days. That might be something that unites left and right. SHAPIRO: NPR's Martin Kaste, thank you. KASTE: You're welcome.

Every individual needs to be seen as the person they are, and not just what they look like,” Smith said. “The black community has always felt inferior or viewed differently and history has repeated itself.

(Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) As the national protests over the death of George Floyd made their way to South Dakota over the weekend, the state’s sports figures watched intently. South Dakota is one of the whitest states in the U.S., with 86.5 percent of the population made up of non-Hispanic whites, but the sports arena is one of the few areas where some diversity exists. For black athletes in South Dakota, who play almost exclusively for white coaches in front of white fans, protests against police misconduct and racism have sparked emotion during what was already a politically charged era. For much of the last few years, players and coaches on both sides of the political aisle have mostly let their differences exist below the surface. Politics and current events are rarely addressed on social media, instead replaced by feel-good messages about tolerance, coexistence and putting differences aside for the pursuit of a common goal. But as both peaceful protests and acts of vandalism dominate the nation’s consciousness, more and more players, athletes and administrators here in South Dakota are speaking up. Buy Photo Former SDSU running back Mikey Daniel talked about racism and reactions to national protests. (Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) Mikey Daniel, a running back from Brookings who played at South Dakota State and signed with the Atlanta Falcons, has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks. He’s challenged his friends and fans to listen to him and others like him just as much when they talk about their experiences as black Americans as they do when he’s scoring touchdowns. “I’m not with all the looting and the rioting and the destroying of communities – I’m not,” Daniel said. “But the people making such a big deal about the looting and destroying of communities are the same people that are saying let’s protest peacefully, and are the exact same people that when Colin Kaepernick was peacefully taking a knee, using his platform to spread awareness throughout the country about what’s really going on and things that we battle with every single day, those same people wanted to have an issue with that and flip the narrative talking about, ‘Oh, well, we’re disrespecting America, we’re disrespecting the flag, we’re disrespecting veterans.' It had nothing to do with any of that, and everything to do with the war on race. The same people that are doing that talking are the same people that told LeBron James to shut up and dribble.” Daniel’s former SDSU teammate, Cade Johnson, posted an illustration of Floyd superimposed over a Black Lives Matter flag as his Twitter background photo, and offered his thoughts on the Minneapolis tragedy and its aftermath.

(Photo: Briana Sanchez / Argus Leader) “As others have weighed in on (Floyd) it has really left me feeling confused, angry, and quite sad,” wrote Johnson, who grew up in Nebraska. “My mother and father have always preached these things when raising us. I’m proud to be an American, but I pray the Lord shines his light in times like these. In life it’s called standing up for what you believe in. Everybody has a voice. If you don’t like what’s going on and what people are doing to stand up for what they believe in, you are the problem.” SDSU’s coach, John Stiegelmeier, is a 63-year-old white man from rural South Dakota. But in his 20-plus years as the Jacks coach Stiegelmeier has made efforts to continue to diversify his staff and create an inclusive team atmosphere in which players feel free to celebrate their individuality. SDSU had a team meeting Sunday night to share feelings about the protests. “We had a special team meeting last night with a number of our black coaches and athletes speaking from the heart,” Stiegelmeier said on Twitter. “It was powerful. There is a solution to any problem. We each need to do what we can to be part of the solution. Doing nothing is doing nothing. Start with love.” Buy Photo Chris Johnson led USF to the NSIC South title this year (Photo: Argus Leader file photo) Christian Smith is one of SDSU’s black coaches, and in a long statement posted on his Twitter account, the Jacks’ defensive line coach related his experiences with racism as a youth and how it shaped him as a person and now as a coach. “How do we move forward as a country and stop ignoring the racial issues that make everyone uncomfortable? Every individual needs to be seen as the person they are, and not just what they look like,” Smith said. “The black community has always felt inferior or viewed differently and history has repeated itself. The reaction to George Floyd is a cry for help and awareness for things not changing. A lot of hurt, sadness, pain and anger has led us to where we are today. I fully support peaceful protest for the cause of change and we can do that together.” Many white coaches and athletes have expressed empathy for the cause as well, showing support for their black teammates and colleagues while acknowledging their role and their own privileged perspective.

Value all life – period.” USD offensive line coach Andrew Prevost vowed to be more aggressive in speaking out after the Coyote staff had a team meeting to hear each other’s thoughts. “It was humbling to hear our student-athletes speak about the turmoil that is going on in our country regarding racial inequality. I want to say sorry for not speaking up earlier,” Prevost wrote. “As a leader I have a responsibility to address this. It angers me that we can’t figure out how to educate ourselves and treat each other. There is a difference between right and wrong and what is going on in our country is inherent racism and is wrong. I commit to you that I will do everything in my power to further people’s understanding of the injustice going on. I commit to you that I will speak up when I hear something that is wrong. I will stand with you.” Current Nebraska and former USD women's basketball coach Amy Williams. (Photo: Nati Harnik, AP) Coaches are parents, too, and the current turmoil has them reflecting on how to educate at home as well as in the locker room. Former USD women’s basketball coach Amy Williams, now at Nebraska, addressed that concern in her own social media message. “I have cried a lot of tears, prayed a lot, but mostly I have been listening,” Williams said. “Listening to my husband describe how he feels when he is the subject of unjust suspicion. Listening to some of my best friends describe the fear they have raising their beautiful black sons in today’s world. Listening to the players I have been blessed to coach discuss their experiences as black women living among today’s social injustices. Listening to my daughters ask questions about what the color of their skin could cause them to face in their futures. While the protests will eventually end and Floyd's case may finally see justice, those speaking out want to make sure their messages aren't forgotten later on. ""I tell white people protesting and marching –thank you,"" Daniel said. ""We see that. But I hope to God that it's not just a show, not just a thing people are doing and you want to fit in. You have to take that and live that. There's a war on race and that's lived daily, it's not just a one-time thing.

A Facebook group called ‘Defend Rapid City Police Department’ has been created in anticipation of a second protest in Rapid City. More than 3,000 people have already joined with some threatening protesters with guns and others offering to guard police officers and businesses from attackers. However, there isn’t a confirmed protest planned in Rapid City. A peaceful memorial walk and protest took place in Rapid City over the weekend. Rumors of a second are circulating in the Defend Rapid City Police Department group--including speculation that people might be traveling to different communities to stir up trouble. The Sioux Falls police department did not confirm busses of rioters. There isn’t confirmation of any sort of second protest happening in Rapid City this week. About 30 members of the Facebook group met in person with a few Rapid City sheriff and police officers to discuss the group. Lieutenant Andy Becker asked them not to get involved. “Trust me, I get the good intentions. You guys want to see the community safe as well. However, for us to be able to do our job, we can’t have groups fighting. That just causes…” “Well we want to see you guys safe.” “I agree and we want to be safe and that’s why we train..” Becker says the department wants to bring community members together and if there is a clash between the groups, it would be more difficult for the police department to handle. “Even these folks, they have a right to, what happened was a horrible deal, they have a right to speak out against it. But we are there to keep the community safe, the people safe.” local businessmen Kenneth Dirk started the Defend Rapid City Police Department group. He says he planned to peacefully guard the police, and that members threatening protesters with guns don’t speak for him. “Why don’t we get together and instead of everything being race, everything is race. It’s like you know what, I put my boots on one [at a] time, you put your shoes on one at a time. We’re alike in that way. Why don’t we focus on what we do together instead of what separates us.” He says everyone agrees that the murder of George Floyd was wrong, and that this is about protecting businesses and lives. ""Everybody’s under a lot of stress. Everybody’s been locked up for three months. They’re unemployed. They've got all these problems and this doesn’t help. But what definitely doesn't help is tearing apart businesses and setting them on fire.” The Rapid City and Police Department are prepared for any protests, but haven't confirmed rumors.",0.0

City and state officials said they would aggressively seek out those who threw rocks at police, businesses and broke into a number of establishments in Sioux Falls on Sunday night, using video footage and photos of the night. ""Those responsible for assaulting our offices, destroying our property, stealing our goods, they will be prosecuted,"" he said in a Monday, June 1, press conference. TenHaken and Sioux Falls Police Chief Matt Burns were quick to separate the violence from an earlier peaceful protest in downtown Sioux Falls that was closely coordinated with city officials. ""I saw two events happen yesterday,"" TenHaken said. A crowd numbering up to 3,000 took part in the protest in Van Eps Park and several other sites in downtown Sioux Falls Sunday afternoon to call for justice for Floyd, who died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly eight minutes. The event, captured on video, has sparked protests across the nation. After the downtown protest in Sioux Falls on Sunday, some of those at the protest marched down nearby Minnesota Avenue to 41st Street, both busy commercial corridors. The march ended at the Empire Mall. The scene at the mall spiraled into violence and destruction, with some protesters throwing rocks at police officers and squad cars and through windows at some of the businesses in the area. Other protesters linked hands in front of the police, forming a human shield against further violence. Shortly after the rock-throwing started, Gov. Kristi Noem quick-deployed a South Dakota National Guard unit to aid police and sheriff's deputies on the scene. City officials issued a curfew for a large area around the mall starting at 10 p.m., then later extended it for the entire city through 7 a.m. Monday, and that seemed to limit further incidents, TenHaken said. One of the break-ins took place at Fleet Farm, six miles away from the mall on the north side of the city, where several firearms were stolen, said Sioux Falls Police Chief Matt Burns. Police officers received only minor injuries from the rock-throwing, TenHaken said, although he held up rock he said weighed between five to seven pounds he said was like those thrown at officers. 'These were mostly kids' State and city officials seemed to differ on their assessment of those involved in the violence. Many of those at the mall throwing rocks were children, including some recognized by their middle-school teacher, TenHaken said. ""These were mostly kids, and mostly that were raised here. I recognized kids on this video, I saw them wearing shirts of local sports league and local high schools,"" he said. ""Our city has failed these kids, and these parents have failed their children. These kids should be ashamed, the rest of us should be embarrassed. It’s heart wrenching."" Burns discounted rumors that held an out-of-town group that had been in Fargo for protests was traveling via bus to Sioux Falls in time for the protests here. Burns said there was no sign of buses or an out-of-town group. ""We had heard those rumors, too,"" he said. ""We don’t know that that materialized."" Of the two people arrested, one was from Omaha, TenHaken said, and it's not uncommon for people to travel from around the region to take part in a well-publicized protest. Noem traveled to Sioux Falls to visit with those whose businesses were damaged Sunday night. In a press conference Monday afternoon, clad in National Guard camouflage ball cap and a polo shirt with the Air National Guard logo, she had much harsher language for those involved in the violence and destruction. “These aren’t protesters that did these actions last night, these are violent criminals,"" she said, ""Do not call them protesters.” More work to do TenHaken said violence and destruction doesn't honor Floyd or advance a cause, but he noted the city has work to do on larger questions such as the racial makeup of the city's police force. “Many are growing impatient with generations of marginalization, with racism, and in some cases, injustice,"" TenHaken said. ""Sioux Falls is not immune to that, But like other places in the nation, we have work ahead of us here to do, to be more inclusive as a city."" Noem also joined TenHaken in expressing a willingness to re-examine state laws and policies regarding law enforcement. ""The questions before us is, what do we want for policies and policing for our cities in the future, what do we want it to look like?"" Noem said. ""Let’s be problem solvers here today and work together.” The state needs a fundamental shift in priorities, said Heather Smith, executive director of ACLU of South Dakota. Smith said the ACLU supports the protesters' cause and called for ""meaningful change"" on behalf of those who have faced system and individual racism from police. “We’re troubled by a continued and pervasive insistence that ‘these things don’t happen in South Dakota.’ South Dakota is not immune to systemic racism,” Smith said in a statement. “Invariably, people of color in South Dakota face systemic barriers to education, health care, employment and justice. In order to move from a place of outrage to a place of healing, we must see real accountability from police departments, the legal system and our elected officials — and that’s just the bare minimum.""",0.0

The Republican governor deployed National Guard troops to the scene of a violent protest in Sioux Falls on Sunday night after stores were vandalized and protesters hurled rocks at police. Her comments came shortly after President Donald Trump told governors in a video conference call they “look like fools” for not deploying more National Guard members to demonstrations across the country. Noem said she would keep the National Guard “pre-staged” nearby protests planned in other cities across the state. “Rioting and looting will not be tolerated,” she said.

(KELO) — Last night’s violent protest near the Empire Mall is taking focus away from some of the positive interactions in downtown Sioux Falls earlier in the evening. It can be easy to amplify the intense moments happening right now but there are interactions like this one taking place as well. South Dakota State Representative Linda Duba attended the event downtown and was happy with what she saw. “The police were respectful. First of all, they didn’t come out in riot gear. And they were very respectful to the participants and the participants also showed their respect to the law enforcement, as we should,” Duba said. Protesters calling for justice for George Floyd and for an end to racism took time to speak with local officers on the streets. They even offered up fist bumps and handshakes. “That’s an incredibly important part of this,” Burns said. Chief Burns says the protest at the courthouse should be set apart from the rest of the evening. He says his officers were proud to stand with individuals to make sure they had a safe space to pursue their First Amendment rights. “We are part of the community. We represent every person in this city. We want every person in this city regardless of race, creed or ethnicity to understand that they can come to us with any problem, report any crime and that we stand with them. I think that was on display yesterday with our officers that were a part of the crowd early on,” Burns said. For Duba, it’s important to establish trust. “That is the way that you police a city, especially when you come out for a peaceful protest. You show that you trust the people of the city to be dignified and accountable and that’s exactly what everyone was. We were all accountable,” Duba said.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/02/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Biden met with political and faith leaders for roughly 90 minutes at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware, where he answered questions, delivered remarks and heard concerns about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Biden said that if he defeats President Trump in November, he would create the oversight board within his first 100 days in office and address institutional racism. ""Hate just hides,"" Biden, who at times lowered the mask he was wearing due to the coronavirus, told attendees. ""It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks."" The former vice president said there should be a change in the way police are trained and suggested, for instance, that when law enforcement officers are confronted with a person without a firearm but ""coming at them with a knife or something,"" cops ""could shoot them in the leg instead of the heart."" ""There are a lot of different things that can change,"" Biden said. Later Monday, the former vice president hosted a virtual roundtable discussion with several mayors, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Biden stressed the importance of ""finding a balance"" between safety and allowing the protests taking place in cities nationwide. The Democratic presidential hopeful's meeting with faith and community leaders comes a day after he visited a protest site in Wilmington. In a post on social media, Biden encouraged the nation to turn ""anguish to purpose."" ""As president, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington,"" Biden wrote. Demonstrations opposing police brutality have erupted in major cities across the country in the days following Floyd's death last Monday. A police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck while he was prone on the pavement for more than eight minutes. In the final minutes of the incident, Floyd was unresponsive, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the 46-year-old's family, said Sunday. The police officer who held Floyd down on the pavement, identified as Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder. While some of the protests against Floyd's death and those of other unarmed African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement have been peaceful, others have left to violent clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The National Guard has been activated in nearly two dozen states and the District of Columbia, and mayors in major U.S. cities have imposed curfews. During a virtual fundraiser last week, Biden said Floyd's death, which he called ""brutal,"" has ""ripped open anew this ugly underbelly of our society."" The former vice president has also called for police reforms that allow for police who engage in misconduct to be held accountable and said he spoke with Floyd's family members.",0.0

There have been a number of violent clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators across the country — but in some cities, officers have knelt in solidarity with demonstrators. In Coral Gables, a city near Miami, a peaceful protest attended by hundreds on Saturday included a moment of prayer with police officers, CBS Miami reported. Powerful images from the demonstration show officers kneeling, heads bowed, in solidarity with protesters.

Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak said he and the organizers of the protest will keep the dialogue going this week though Zoom. The two chiefs of police also acknowledged the need for better training and reviewing protocols. A similar scene played out in parts of New York City. Although there have been clashes in parts of the city, one official in Queens took a knee as demonstrators chanted ""thank you"" and ""keep the peace,"" CBS New York reported. Another officer was seen taking a knee in solidarity in Times Square on Sunday, prompting a hug from a demonstrator. In Washington, D.C., a group of officers lined up and took a knee in front of the Trump International Hotel. ""There was an immediate outburst of joy and fist bumping,"" tweeted CBS News' Julia Boccagno, who captured video of the scene. In Ferguson, Missouri, the non-profit Heroic Imagination captured the moment when protesters and Ferguson police officers kneeled for over nine minutes in solidarity, CBS affiliate KMOV reported. Ferguson, where an 18-year-old black man named Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in 2014, was the catalyst for widespread protests against brutality at the time. Photos from Houston, Texas, show Police Chief Art Acevedo walking with protesters during their march. And in Bellevue, Washington, Police Chief Steve Mylett knelt in solidarity with a group of protesters. He then addressed the crowd, telling them, ""We are with you, we're not against you,"" video showed.

The move follows a night of violence after a day of largely peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd. ""I stand behind the protesters and their message, but unfortunately there are people who are looking to distract and discredit this moment,"" Cuomo said. ""The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause. While we encourage people to protest peacefully and make their voices heard, the safety of the general public is paramount and cannot be compromised."" Even before Monday's curfew took effect, de Blasio tweeted there would be another curfew beginning at 8 p.m. on Tuesday night. ""These protests have power and meaning. But as the night wears on we are seeing groups use them to incite violence and destroy property,"" he wrote. ""Our first priority is keeping people safe, so I'm extending the curfew to Tuesday. It will begin at 8pm."" New York City — which has more than 8 million residents — is following other large cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. Cuomo had said earlier he would speak with de Blasio about a curfew, and said ""legally, I can impose a curfew."" There have been curfews imposed in some of New York's smaller cities, including Buffalo and Albany. Cuomo also said the NYPD will double its presence on the street from 4,000 officers to 8,000 officers. Earlier Monday, Cuomo had said he thought the size of the NYPD would avoid him having to activate the National Guard, like other cities have done. The NYPD said more than 400 people were arrested overnight, adding that several police officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries and roughly a dozen police vehicles were damaged, CBS New York reported. Earlier Monday, Cuomo said ""last night was bad for New York City."" There has been criticism over the NYPD's reaction to protesters, including an incident involving an NYPD vehicle that drove into a crowd of protesters. Cuomo has repeatedly said he has appointed Attorney General Letitia James to review police conduct. There have been days of unrest nationwide following Floyd's death in Minneapolis on May 25. Floyd, a black man, died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded for air. One officer has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, and he was fired along with three others. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead all prosecutions related to Floyd's death, officials announced Sunday night. Audrey McNamara contributed to this report.",0.0

(KELO) — Peaceful protests gave way to criminal acts Sunday night in Sioux Falls. Monday, Governor Kristi Noem met with city leaders, law enforcement, and victims. Governor Kristi Noem says protests have a purpose, and that Sunday’s peaceful protests honored the memory of George Floyd, but then the agenda changed. “Today, the conversation isn’t about the peaceful protest, it’s about the violence that happened last night, and violence will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” Governor Kristi Noem said. Noem says mob rule does nothing to honor victims. After police officers had rocks and obscenities tossed their way, authorities say the criminal acts spilled into the private sector. “Property was destroyed, business owners were victimized, stores were looted and vandalized,” Noem said. The governor, alongside Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, visited with victims Monday, including a stop at Riddle’s Jewelry, where an estimated $45,000 worth of theft and damage occurred. “These aren’t protesters that did these actions last night, these are violent criminals, do not call them protesters,” Noem said. Noem says change only happens if we create change, and has charged her team with finding solutions through legislative action. “We have been having this conversation about race and inequality for decades in this country and a lot of politicians and public figures stand up and talk, and frankly I’m more interested in what we can do,” Noem said. Despite last night’s violence, Noem says a vast majority of South Dakotans made the right decision. “There is no other governor in this country that has trusted her people more than I have, and I still do trust the folks of this state,” Noem said. The governor says she’s aware of planned protests in other South Dakota cities, and is working to help make sure those protests remain peaceful.",0.0

Authorities are looking into how a peaceful protest in the name of racial equality turned into vandalism, theft, tear gas, injuries and the activation of the National Guard. Police say protestors threw large rocks at officers and vandalized several businesses near the Empire Mall. There were also break-ins at some stores nearby. People we talked with Sunday night said officers deployed tear gas and used rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. You could find empty tear gas canisters and rubber bullets in the parking lot. It’s the tale of two protests. First, there was one in Downtown Sioux Falls in which community members came together in the name of George Floyd and countless others. When the sun went down, a crowd made its way to the Empire Mall and things escalated. “We just want peace. We’re tired of – that ain’t happening. We’ve been pushed to the edge. People like us have been pushed to the edge,” Tupak Kpeayeh said. “This group of white people that were standing right behind me, they were from out of town, they grabbed these rocks and started throwing them at the mall. Started throwing them at the mall and tried to ruin everything we tried to accomplish today,” Christina Ristesund said. “This rock actually physically came from the scene last night at the Empire Mall. We had rocks much larger than that narrowly miss our officers,” Chief Matt Burns, Sioux Falls Police Dept., said. Chief Burns says officers worked with organizers on the afternoon event. “I do not want those events at the mall in Southwest Sioux Falls and other areas to put a dark stain on that,” Burns said. However, they prepared for the worst later on. Police, deputies, guard members, and highway patrol troopers were all in the mall parking lot. “If you think you can riot, loot, steal, burglarize, create property damage and hurt others in this city with impunity, you’re mistaken,” Burns said. Police say officers have arrested two people. One of the suspects is from Omaha. However, Mayor Paul Ten Haken says a lot of the people in surveillance videos and pictures are local. Authorities are looking at pictures and video of people committing crimes, and working with the State’s Attorney on any more charges. “We will then work to communicate and seek justice on behalf of our community, both our persons and the businesses within our community and we will seek to hold them responsible according to what they have done,” Crystal Johnson said. Kpeayeh, who wasn’t in the Empire Mall parking lot, but in the area, says what we’re seeing here and all over the nation is a boiling point over racial inequality. “I’ve got siblings. I’ve got little sisters. I’ve got brothers all that. If they got pulled over, I don’t want them to get shot. When my mom calls, she’s going to be scared if I get pulled over, because she’s going to think I will get shot or something,” Kpeayeh said.",0.0

Bunch discussed the ongoing unrest throughout the country. Lonnie Bunch: The protest is always the way those who are voiceless speak. And so, I've always thought that protests, in some ways, is the highest form of patriotism, because you're really trying to make a country better. Norah O'Donnell: What about the violence connected with these protests? I also understand that there's frustration. What I think we want to make sure is that these protests keep focused on what this is about. It's about honoring George Floyd. It's about making sure this country realizes that this is the moment it can change itself. What do you think history teaches us about this moment we're in?

So, it tells me this is a time for us not to rest. For a time to realize that history suggests that this is part of a long arc. The arc of history bends towards justice. But it bends slowly. It bends towards justice slowly. And the challenge for us is to recognize that this is a moment that really needs to be a tipping point.

""We are working expeditiously, as fast as we can, but we have a duty to be fair and we're going to be fair,"" Ellison told Elaine Quijano, anchor of ""Red & Blue"" on CBSN. ""But let me tell you, my eyes work pretty well, I saw what everybody saw, and I am committed to justice in this case."" Ellison's comments come after nearly a week of nationwide protests, which have turned into violent clashes between police and demonstrators in many U.S. cities. In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz fully mobilized the state's National Guard this weekend. The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died on May 25 after a police officer pressed his knee onto his neck — despite Floyd's repeated pleading for air. Earlier Monday, an independent autopsy concluded that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation, and the medical examiner called his death a homicide. A second autopsy commissioned by Hennepin County also called his death a homicide, but disagreed on how exactly he died. Derek Chauvin, the officer who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck, was charged last Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But protesters have called for more serious charges against Chauvin and for the other officers present to be charged. Read Quijano's interview with Ellison below: Quijano: I want to start by getting your reaction to the independent autopsy results released today. A lawyer for George Floyd's family says it found he died from ""asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain."" Does that change how Derek Chauvin should be prosecuted? Ellison: You know at this point, it's not proper for me to comment on the evidence. We have been in touch with Mr. Crump, we're receiving a copy of this autopsy. It is important information and we take it very seriously, and we will factor it in. All the information we can get our hands on, we want to use that. We are taking a fresh look at the charges, at the evidence, and at any individual who we may or may not eventually also include as a defendant in this case. So, it's important and it's influential, clearly, but I really can't assign a weight to it because I haven't read it myself, and neither has my staff. We are arranging to get a copy, and when we review it, we will factor it into our calculations. As you know, there are calls for the other three police officers involved in George Floyd's arrest and subsequent death to also face charges. Do you anticipate that will happen? Certainly, it's on the table. Let me be clear, it is very important that I protect this prosecution, meaning that I don't want anybody to say that there was a rush to judgment or that the charges are the product of public pressure. I need to be able to say that based on the facts and the behavior of the individuals involved, and the law, that these charges are just and are fair and are right. What I am sharing with you and everybody else is that they can count on me to hold people to maximum accountability based on the available charges and the facts that exist in the case. With neither fear or favor, we are going to hold people accountable and get justice for this victim, Mr. George Floyd. This question of accountability — when people see that video, for some, it is clear. But could you talk about some of the unique challenges prosecuting police officers in particular? Well, these cases have challenges. Look at the Freddie Gray case, nobody eventually got convicted for that. If you look at the Walter Scott case, even Philando Castile a few years ago here in Minnesota. I'm old enough to remember the Rodney King case where there was an acquittal in that Simi Valley jury on the first round. These cases are not easy. I know people look at the video and they are like, ""What is the problem? Charge him."" It is simple, we see it — but by time an experienced defense attorney gets a hold of this case, they begin to look for any crack that they can, and they are experienced in trying to raise doubts. That means we have to be prepared. That means we have to work very hard and make certain that we have an airtight, ironclad case, and that takes preparation. So I am asking for folks who have invested their trust in me to conduct this prosecution to allow me to do the kind of preparation that will give them long-term satisfaction that justice was done, as opposed to short-term promises about who is going to be charged and with what. We are working expeditiously, as fast as we can, but we have a duty to be fair and we're going to be fair. But let me tell you, my eyes work pretty well, I saw what everybody saw, and I am committed to justice in this case. What do you say to someone who says, ""If that's the case, and these challenges are so great, does that reflect a problem here, a weakness in our criminal justice system when it comes to protecting particularly African American men?"" Yes, absolutely that is true. I would agree with that, there is no doubt about it. Our criminal justice system is used as a system of social control so often. I mean, just look at the drug laws. I mean, blacks and whites use marijuana at the exact same rate and blacks are arrested way more, go to prison way more — and now that the country is saying we are going to go into the cannabis business, very few African Americans are even allowed to participate in that industry. So yeah, injustice has been a hallmark of our criminal justice system as it relates to African Americans, but I'd also add other peoples of color, poor white people. You know, we fund prosecution, we don't find public defense systems. All over the country, this is a very serious problem and it contributes to the rage and anger that we see all across our country. And I think that we can, and I will do all that I can — Is that something you can help address, Mr. Attorney General? Absolutely. Well, the first thing is justice for Mr. George Floyd. That's what we've got to do, that is job number one. But that will not bring us to justice. We have got to have, in every state, city, and in the federal government, we've got to have a deep-seated analysis of how we make this society truly just. I will say that the federal government under President Donald Trump has not brought a single pattern-or-practice lawsuit against a single municipality. President Obama did, but even, he tried to roll those back when he came into office. We need the federal government as a partner, and I'm urging them to step up and look at this particular crisis as an opportunity to do the right thing. You mentioned the president. I also want to ask you about comments he made. What is your reaction to his call for governors and law enforcement to ""dominate"" protesters? I think this attitude and spirit of domination is exactly what has sparked the problem. The fact that Mr. George Floyd was not talked to — according to the complaint, they walked him to the car with a gun drawn even though he was suspected, never convicted, of a nonviolent offense, I think that is the heart of the problem. It doesn't work. In fact, it has caused protests all over the United States and the world. It causes civil judgments for cities, it causes loss of life, injury, distrust of law enforcement. And low-income communities need law enforcement, they are so often the greatest victims of criminal action — so we need a trusting relationship with law enforcement, but we don't have one because of this attitude of domination. I think the president is incorrect, desperately so. The president has asserted many of the protesters are members of antifa. Do you agree with that assessment? We have no evidence that that is true at all. We do have evidence that people who are not in any way supportive of the protest or justice for George Floyd are actually at work committing acts of arson. We have seen them on tape, they have been confronted by some of the legitimate protesters, but where they come from and what their ideology is premature. Nobody really knows that, and it is irresponsible to jump to conclusions before we have evidence. I do want to ask about 2018 when you faced criticism for tweeting a photo of yourself holding the antifa anti-fascist handbook. Has your opinion of the antifa movement changed since you became Minnesota's attorney general? The first time I ever heard the word is when Trump said it. I walked into a bookstore and thought it was funny, that I just heard Trump mention it, and here's a book that is right there with the name on it. So I thought it was actually funny, and I didn't think it would be nearly the thing that the people, for political reasons, wanted to try to push. It's a photo, it was meant to not even be a serious thing — but in American politics, anything and everything somebody can use to try to discredit you, they do. So that's just the way it is. All right, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Mr. Ellison, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. We really appreciate it. Thank you.",0.0

""I'm challenging everybody in my race to step up and find a better way, but I am also challenging the white counterparts, my white peers — this starts with you,"" Hayes told CBSN. ""My people, black people, the black race, the minority, have been fighting for hundreds of years for equality,"" he said. ""We have led the frontline, and we will continue to do so, but we need the white communities who know and feel that right now social injustice is happening. And we need them to step up with us and hold their white peers accountable."" Protests have erupted across the country over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee onto Mr. Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Two autopsies released on Monday concluded that Mr. Floyd's death was a homicide. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Protesters are calling for the four police officers present to be arrested and charged with murder. Numerous demonstrations have been peaceful, while others have resulted in property destruction and violent responses from law enforcement. A video of Hayes at a protest in Charlotte, North Carolina, urging two black men, ages 16 and 45, to turn their anger into action was shared widely online. Hayes said Monday that he felt compelled to intervene in the situation in order to prevent the teenage protester from turning to rage. ""I do not want that 16-year-old to look at your anger and take it, and turn it into rage,"" Hayes said of the 45-year-old. ""Because you are angry, and I wanted to let him know that I hear you, but there's a way to do it... I want you to turn your anger and use your voice for the better and for the good.""

""We read about what's going on and we look at the protests... we only see the images, we only hear people yelling… but we're not listening to what they're yelling about. We're not listening to what they're screaming about, we're not listening to why they are marching,"" he said. ""We see the smoke, we see the tear gas, and we think: 'This is chaos.' But no one ever stops to say 'how did we get to the chaos?'"" Hayes is a small business owner, and a father of a five-year-old son. He said he still hasn't ""figured out a way"" to tell his son about the social injustice faced by African Americans. ""We want our kids to walk in the same footsteps as us and be like us, but I don't want him to walk in the same footsteps as me because I am walking in the footsteps of my ancestors and people before me. I do not want him to experience the social injustice,"" Hayes said, choking up. ""I do not want him to experience the unequal opportunities that we face right now. I want him to be able to be just a man in America, that raises his kids, that fulfills his purpose, to dedicate his life to being a better man than we all have,"" he said. ""I do not want him to walk in the same footsteps or experience the same hurt, the same anger that I have experienced, or my ancestors before me.""",0.0
1622813086,2020-06-01 20:53:27,2020 Daily Trail Markers: Trump declares “we will dominate the streets”,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-daily-trail-markers-trump-declares-we-will-dominate-the-streets/,en,False,,152133,kotaradio.com,http://kotaradio.com/,"President Trump appeared at the White House Rose Garden for a last-minute address to the nation in the wake of demonstrations, Monday evening, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. ""We will end it now,"" Mr. Trump said, calling himself, ""your president of law and order."" Exactly one week after Minnesotan George Floyd's death in police custody, the president said he has recommended every state executive deploy its National Guard: ""We will dominate the streets."" Mr. Trump added that if states or cities refuse to act in response to protests, ""then I will deploy the U.S. military and quickly solve the problem for them."" He also announced the federal government will dispatch ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed soldiers"" and police to enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, D.C., tonight, adding that violators would be detained and prosecuted. Loud explosions echoed through the Rose Garden as police deployed tear gas canisters and flash bangs on peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park to clear the way for the president. Flanked by members of his cabinet and staff, Mr. Trump departed White House grounds for a visit to historic St. John's Church, a sanctuary where presidents past have long worshipped. Boarded up following last night's demonstrations that briefly set the church's basement ablaze, the president did not enter to pray, but vowed to keep the country ""nice and safe"" while wielding a Bible. Only hours earlier, President Trump unloaded on the nation's governors Monday morning, calling them ""weak"" for failing to more aggressively enforce law and order over the weekend, as some of the nation's biggest cities burned in the wake of the death of George Floyd, reports CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. On a video teleconference, the president warned that the law enforcement presence across Washington would be set to intensify later Monday. He said the protests are ruining the nation's standing on the world stage. And he called on governors to pass new bans on flag burning, a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. ""Washington was under very good control, but we're going to have it under much more control,"" Mr. Trump said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""We're going to pull in thousands of people."" He added later, ""We're going to clamp down very, very strong."" The president's comments came as Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that the nation's capital would be under a 7 p.m. ET curfew for the next two nights. And the president spoke as his presumed Democratic Party rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, was praying and meeting with religious and community leaders in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, about the violence roiling the country. During the call, the president repeatedly called into question the leadership and decisions made over the weekend by governors and big-city mayors, pressuring them to make broader use of the National Guard and other military capabilities. ""You're making a mistake because you're making yourselves look like fools,"" he told the governors at one point. ""And some have done a great job. But a lot of you, it's not – it's not a great day for our country."" One participant on the call described the president's words and tone as ""unhinged."" ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time. They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate,"" the president told governors. The president said that the violence ""is coming from the radical left — you know, it everybody knows it — but it's also looters, and it's people that figure they can get free stuff by running into stores and running out with television sets. I saw it — a kid has a lot of stuff, he puts it in the back of a brand new car and drives off. You have every one of these guys on tape. Why aren't you prosecuting them? Now, the harder you are, the tougher you are, the less likely you're going to be hit."" This kind of violence has happened before, Mr. Trump said. ""It's happened numerous times. And the only time it's successful is when you're weak. And most of you are weak. I will say this, what's going on in Los Angeles — I have a friend lives in Los Angeles — they say all the storefronts are gone,"" the president continued. ""They're all broken and gone. The merchandise is gone. It's a shame. It didn't look as bad to me — maybe it was the sunshine, I don't know. But in Los Angeles, the storefronts are gone. Philadelphia's a mess. What happened there is horrible."" Prior to his press conference this evening, the president himself hadn't been seen publicly since Saturday, when he attended a space shuttle launch and addressed the death of George Floyd in Florida. Mr. Trump was briefly moved to the White House bunker on Friday evening as protests were being held near the White House. Mr. Trump was joined on the call by Attorney General William Barr — who he said he plans to ""activate very strongly"" — General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. ""We can't play whack-a-mole,"" Barr told the governors — before the president interjected. ""If you're weak and don't dominate your streets, they're going to stay with you until you finally do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And you don't want it. Philadelphia, you'd better toughen up. Because what's going on in Philadelphia, like New York, is terrible. It's terrible. You'd better toughen — they'll never leave. I know you want to say, 'Oh, let's not call up the Guard, let's call up 200 people.' You've got a big National Guard out there that's ready to come in and fight like hell. I tell ya, the best, what they did in Minneapolis was incredible."" ""We're shocked that you're not using the greatest resource,"" the president added — urging governors to call up the National Guard. Esper told the governors that so far just two states had called up more than 1,000 Guard troops. ""You've got to arrest these people. You've got arrest these people — and you've got to charge them,"" the president said to the governors. ""And you can't do this deal where they get one week in jail. These are terrorists, these are terrorists, they're looking to do bad things to our country. They're Antifa and they're radical left."" Amid talk of more aggressive police tactics, the president made specific suggestions on how law enforcement should engage aggressive protesters: ""When they have bricks — you know they come armed with bricks. And they have bricks and rocks, big rocks, and they have other big things, and they throw them. You know, you're allowed to fight back, folks. You don't have to have a brick hit you in the face, and you don't do anything about it. You are allowed to fight back,"" the president said. Mentioning Barr, the president said, ""Bill —... if a brick is thrown at somebody, and it hits them, or maybe if it doesn't hit them, your very tough, strong, powerful people are allowed to fight back against that guy. And very strongly and powerfully."" FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN At Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, Joe Biden sat in front of the altar area with a notepad in his hands and a mask on his face to listen to the ideas of local political and religious leaders on how to engage communities after the death of George Floyd, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. For his part, Biden said he would recommend a ""police oversight board"" within the first 100 days of his administration. In the next few weeks, Biden said he would make several national addresses about how the country should proceed. For these addresses, he was taking suggestions from the community members as they socially-distant gathered in the church pews. Reverends and bishops spoke about engaging youth leaders and not hearing their ideas filtered through a ""youth minister."" Some of the political and business leaders said that economic help, including addressing poverty, was vital, too. One of the most emotional moments was when Delaware Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, an ally of Biden's, displayed her bracelet dedicated to Floyd's words during the arrest: ""I can't breathe."" Blunt Rochester said Floyd's death is an example that minorities' ""breath has been taken away, and we have to get it back."" The congresswoman also was straightforward with Biden that the country has ""so many programs"" that have not been effective. ""We need action and we need resources,"" she told him. Others gathered, like Reverend Shanika Perry, described to Biden that it was difficult to be his ""surrogate"" with young people she knows because they have hesitations about his role with the 1994 crime bill. Perry and one other bishop added that one way Biden could positively move forward is by picking a black woman as his running mate. Later in the day, Biden virtually gathered with the mayors of major cities including Mayor Melvin Carter from St. Paul, Mayor Lori Lightfoot from Chicago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms from Atlanta and Mayor Eric Garcetti from Los Angeles. These mayors echoed many of the sentiments of the local leaders in the morning session. Biden reiterated to the mayors he believes it is important for their citizens to ""find a balance"" between understandable protests and emotions (""I'm angry too,"" Biden said) and the destruction that has occurred in some places. Carter said St. Paul residents are not willing to ""return to quiet"" but instead are adhering to an approach of ""peace but not patience."" Lightfoot called the nationwide reaction to the alleged actions of Officer Derek Chauvin ""momentous,"" as she described it as a rallying moment for people, politicians and uniformed officers alike. All four mayors expressed their own grievances with the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent protests. Lance Bottoms explained that the president said he would send the military to help with the protests but doesn't send a ""single dime"" into communities like hers. ""The simple answer,"" Garcetti said, was ""we need money and morals"" from the federal government. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters during today's briefing that President Trump has ""a long history of condemning white supremacy and racism."" But the president, in fact, has a long history of stoking racial tensions dating back to his time as a New York City real estate mogul, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. In 1989, the president called for the state of New York to adopt the death penalty following the conviction of the ""Central Park Five,"" five black and Latino men who as teenagers were wrongly convicted of the raping of a jogger in Manhattan. As late as 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump falsely claimed that President Obama was not born in the United States. The president remarked there were ""fine people"" on ""both sides"" of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, following a white supremacy rally in 2017. And last year, the president said a group of four minority congresswomen should ""go back"" to the countries they came from, a factually inaccurate, racial trope. The White House confirmed President Trump is scheduled to travel to Maine, Friday. Earlier today on the president's call with state leaders, Maine Governor Janet Mills expressed her concerns with Mr. Trump that his trip might ""cause security problems"" following Maine's peaceful protests. The president said he expects a ""tremendous crowd"" but no problems. ""I think most of them are very favorable,"" Trump said of the anticipated audience. ""They like their president."" LIFE AFTER 2020 CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker announced the framework for policing reform legislation says CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The former presidential candidate called for reforming 18 U.S.C. Section 242, a federal statute that governs police misconduct, for greater police accountability in the federal court system. Part of the legislation also includes the creation of a national police misconduct registry that would provide increased transparency in police misconduct data. In addition, Booker wants to improve police training by banning religious and racial profiling, funding racial bias training and ""incentivizing states to adopt policies banning the use of choke-hold and other airway restrictive holds in their use-of-force policies."" In a press call, Booker said, ""Persistent and unchecked bias in policing and this deep history of a lack of accountability are wreaking havoc in African-American communities. And we are seeing the protests. Millions of people expressing outrage for change."" ISSUES THAT MATTER PROTESTING President Trump has signaled the federal government ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" even though there is no existing legal authority for the move, reports CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. As protests over the death of George Floyd continue for a second week, President Trump is holding left-wing extremists groups responsible for the damage and discord on the streets of America. This morning on a call with governors, the president said that the violence ""is coming from the radical left, you know it, everybody knows it."" A new report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism says an initial assessment of protests revealed that ""while a number of extremists – including anti-government agitators, anarchists and a handful of white supremacists – are taking an active role, these protests should not be categorized as ""extremist"" events at this point."" According to the ADL assessment ""a handful of white supremacists have shown up at Black Lives Matter rallies around the country,"" while other white supremacists are using violent images and videos of the protests as recruitment tools. On social media, ADL found that some white supremacists, especially those supportive of ""accelerationism"" – the view that a long-promised race-war is imminent – are celebrating the prospect of increased violence and urging others to take full advantage. The ADL assessment also found that right-wing anti-government extremist groups like the ""boogaloo"" movement, are also reacting to the protests. While most boogalooers are not white supremacists, the ADL says, they variously anticipate and prepare for a future civil war. ""Many boogalooers have seen the protests as an opportunity to further their anti-police crusade and make common cause with others angry at police,"" the ADL report reads. ""In sharp contrast to the boogalooers, members of the militia movement and allied groups have expressed very little empathy with the protesters. Their reactions have been far more hostile, in part because the militia movement views the protests as organized by the extreme left for nefarious purposes."" While the ADL assessment provides several examples of right-wing groups showing up at protests across the country and using the moment for personal gains on social media, it only makes one reference to Antifa, simply mentioning that they have ""also shown up at protests."" Asked about extremist groups showing up at protests to cause chaos, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said during a press conference Monday there will be investigations about who is causing the damage and admitted ""I got out over my skis a little bit on this and as I said, I think it was probably hard for me to fathom that this was coming internally. You cannot have a blind spot."" Walz said in addition to the social media posts from extremist groups, the data set ""has to be much broader"" in order to provide a better understanding of the issue. John Harrington, commissioner of Minnesota Department of Public Safety, also said there is a need for more data outside of social media to understand and prove the involvement of extremist groups at protests. Harrington said he heard ""crazy stuff"" about the ""Klan marching down the street and we've got traffic cams, we've got – none of that happened."" He added that ""some of it looks like it is deliberately being planned as misinformation."" STATE-BY-STATE CALIFORNIA California Governor Gavin Newsom said he cares more about unity ""than some of the noise"" he heard on a phone call with President Trump this morning. Newsom said his reaction to Monday morning's call where the president called governors ""weak"" is ""to focus on the things that unite us not what divides us."" CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says Newsom added that California will provide resources needed to local officials and community leaders to address the rise in violence ""but we must resolve to provide those resources to address the systematic problems."" Reacting to the calls for justice that have led to nationwide protests, Newsom said ""the black community is not responsible for what is happening in this country right now. We are. We are. Our institutions are responsible. We have a unique responsibility to the black community in this country and we've been paying lip service about that for generations."" The California governor said people have lost patience ""because they haven't seen progress."" In order to meet the moment, Newsom said leaders need to listen, adding ""society becomes how we behave, we are our behaviors. Each and every one of us has an obligation to do better."" Since the coronavirus outbreak, Newsom has been hesitant about directly criticizing President Trump, but he's often said the country lacks leadership. During Monday afternoon's press conference Newsom said leaders can be found everywhere. ""Leadership is not just some fancy title,"" Newsom said. ""We are desperate for leadership in this country,"" he added. President Trump has recently blamed ANTIFA, left-wing anti-fascist extremists, for inciting the violence at protests. Mr. Trump also tweeted Monday afternoon a video with the caption ""Anarchists, we see you!"" But Newsom refused to name any specific groups on Monday. ""You have groups that are hell-bent on creating problems and anarchists groups. You've got folks that are well defined that have been highlighted by the president and others,"" Newsom said. He added that he's not suggesting the names of the groups should be hidden, ""but I also see every time elected official like me mentions them, they start to be spread between their supporters, and with all due respect of some of these groups, I'm not going to give you that privilege right now."" FLORIDA Amid ongoing protests that took place over the weekend in response to the killing of George Floyd, Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini warned ""fake protesters"" in a tweet Sunday that an AR-15 rifle ""will be a very common sight upon illegal entry"" into businesses in Lake County. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that the post, which included a photo of an AR-15, has garnered more than 18,000 likes and 9,000 retweets within the past day. ""The tweet is a warning. It warns people that in places like Lake County and any more medium-sized county or a rural county, you won't be able to just loot a business without consequences,"" Sabatini told Mitchell. Sabatini, who also works part-time as an officer for the Florida Army National Guard, added that his message was a ""sincere warning"" that if people ""try to rob a business, they're going to be shot, period. It's just the way it works."" Sabatini continued. ""Those who are peacefully protesting — first of all, all 330 million Americans, I think agree with them…Nobody's defending the actions of that horrible police officer. But one thing I would tell them is to be very careful to disassociate with anyone who believes that breaking laws is justified to further their protest…"" The Florida Democratic Party called on Twitter to remove Sabatini's account for violence but in a message sent to the Lake County representative, Twitter said it couldn't identify any violations of their rules. ""Although Twitter may think it's okay to incite violence, Florida will not stand for it,"" the FLDP tweeted Monday. ""Representative, be prepared to get voted out."" GEORGIA Next week voters in Georgia will participate in their primary – one that has been delayed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While former Vice President Joe Biden will essentially run unopposed, the senate race bidding for the seat of incumbent Senator David Perdue has its fair share of excitement. The Democratic Primary for the seat remains unpredictable and crowded. One candidate, former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson, spoke with CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry about the protests taking the country by storm and some of her proposals in addressing policing. ""What we have seen this last three and a half years in this current administration and the complicity of the Republicans is really a dissolving of those civic structures that kept us together as a people,"" Tomlinson said. She spoke about the need to amend the Civil Rights Act to address the issue of qualified immunity, that some say has prevented police from facing consequences for their alleged misconduct. ""We need to go ahead and legislatively take the responsibility of defining how much immunity is going to apply to the work the police officers do,"" Tomlinson said and added, ""no way is there immunity for these types of brutal killings."" Finally Tomlinson took a jab at one of her Democratic primary rivals, Jon Ossoff, who, along with another contender, Sarah Riggs Amico, transferred their personal money into their respective campaigns. ""I believe they made the miscalculation that this race can be run on money and ads."" Tomlinson also added that she has continued to outraise her opponent in dollars raised from Georgia residents. IOWA Iowa Congressman Steve King is facing his toughest primary race in years on Tuesday, as Republicans who usually safeguard their incumbents have either shied away from defending him or backed his challengers, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster and CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. While King has drawn headlines for years for his controversial comments, the message from those hoping to unseat him has focused more on what King isn't able to do in Washington. In 2019, King was stripped of his House committee assignments after comments he made about white nationalism and white supremacy, which prompted a swift bipartisan backlash. ""White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"" King said in a New York Times interview in January 2019. Republican candidates and outside groups have honed in on King's waning influence. He has not only lost his committee assignments, but Republicans aren't even listening to his opinions, says Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa Republican leader who has endorsed King's main primary opponent, Iowa state Senator Randy Feenstra. ""He can't even influence the committees because they're not accepting his voice,"" said Vander Plaats, who is president and CEO of the Family Leader, a Christian conservative group in Iowa. ""Just because you can scream conservative issues really, really loud in the middle of the street, the fact is, if nobody's listening to you, it doesn't make a difference anymore."" King has chalked up his white nationalist comments in The New York Times to a misquote and ""weaponizing"" of the term. At a debate on Tuesday, he said the backlash and his removal were ""ginned up"" by the ""never-Trumpers."" King has comfortably held the rural, conservative Iowan district since 2002, but in 2018 his seat was very much in play. First-time congressional candidate Democrat J.D. Scholten lost to King by just three points and Scholten is poised to be the Democratic nominee again in 2020. In deeply Republican Sioux County, where King got 72% of the vote in 2018 and 80% in 2016, Republican county chair Tammy Kobza is backing King. ""He's the one that will best defend America, its greatness and Donald Trump's agenda,"" she said. In addition to the U.S House primaries in Iowa, there is a Democratic Senate primary where four candidates are competing to take on Republican Senator Joni Ernst in November, notes CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed businesswoman Theresa Greenfield who has led the pack in total contributions in fundraising reports filed ahead of the primary. Greenfield is up against Eddie Mauro, Michael Franken, and Kimberly Graham. In total, Democratic candidates and outside groups have booked almost $11 million in ad reservations from the start of the year through the primary, according to data from Kantar/CMAG. The Senate Majority PAC has contributed the bulk of that figure by spending almost $7 million on ads supporting Greenfield. KANSAS Monday was the deadline for candidates to file to run in the U.S. Senate primary in Kansas, and after months of speculation Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not file to run, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Pompeo has told reporters numerous times over the past few months that his intention was to continue to serve as secretary of state but speculation continued in part because there is a large pool of relatively unknown Republican candidates and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wished Pompeo would run. The Kansas secretary of state's office posted the unofficial list of candidates who have filed for the open seat, and the list includes 11 GOP candidates and two Democratic candidates. The seat will be open since Republican Senator Pat Roberts announced last summer he would retire at the end of his term. MICHIGAN Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said of President Trump's teleconference with governors that the call was ""deeply disturbing."" She said at a press conference later Monday that ""[Mr. Trump] repeatedly and viciously attacked governors who are doing everything we can to keep the peace while we're working to save lives in a once in a generation pandemic."" Whitmer added that the country is in a moment that requires ""empathy and humanity and unity."" Whitmer also announced Monday she is rescinding Michigan's safer-at-home order and allowing businesses and restaurants to begin opening with capacity limits in the next week, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The controversial order was at times one of the strictest in the country and has drawn legal challenges from Republicans in the state legislature. Retailers will be able to open on June 4 and restaurants will be able to open on June 8. Restaurants will need to operate at 50% capacity and maintain six feet of distance between groups. Whitmer is also allowing day camps for children to open on June 8. Gyms and fitness centers will be allowed to conduct outdoor classes, practices, training sessions or games as long as ""coaches, spectators, and participants maintain six feet of distance from one another during these activities."" Effective immediately, Michigan is also allowing groups of up to 100 people to gather outdoors as long as people practice social distancing. Whitmer is still requiring Michiganders to wear face masks while in enclosed public spaces and asking people to work from home as much as possible. Some businesses that involve ""close contact and shared surfaces"" will remain closed, including ""gyms, hair salons, indoor theaters, tattoo parlors, casinos, and similar establishments."" In testimony before a House subcommittee on Tuesday, Whitmer is expected to criticize the Trump administration for the ""confusion"" in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic over the allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE) from the federal government, according to her prepared remarks obtained by CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Her prepared remarks note that the state was directed to receive PPE from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), but Whitmer says there was confusion, since Mr. Trump had also suggested states think about buying equipment from private suppliers. ""As the state pursued PPE on the national and international markets, the lack of centralized coordination at the federal level created a counterproductive competition between states and the federal government to secure limited supplies, driving up prices and exacerbating existing shortages,"" her remarks read. Whitmer is also planning to call for clearer information from the federal government on testing supplies. The Democratic governor is expected to ask Congress for more federal assistance as the state faces a projected budget shortfall. Also in Michigan, the state's Republican party is calling on Whitmer and Senator Gary Peters to respond to a statement from Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes that said people who support President Trump are racist. ""If you support Donald Trump, you are a racist. Here is where it gets tricky and uncomfortable. Donald Trump is a racist, and if being a racist is not a dealbreaker for you, you are the reason Black people are being murdered for being Black,"" Barnes said in a statement Sunday in the wake of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. ""We have arrived at the turning point, where silence is not an option. I hope we can all see the difference between protesting and rioting. There is so much anger, I am angry also, but I am not moved by pleas for understanding. Here is what I want to see: I want the economic oppression of Black communities to stop, including holding the oppressors accountable. I want meaningful criminal justice reform. And I want law enforcement to actually do their jobs and prosecute hate crimes, and when law enforcement participates in racist conduct I want them held accountable — not by the prosecutors and colleagues they work with every day, but by an independent body, that they hold no sway over,"" Barnes' statement continued. Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox responded to Barnes today, calling it ""inflammatory"" and accusing her of ""fanning the flames that are burning in our cities."" In a statement Cox said, ""Far too often, African-Americans receive unfair treatment from law enforcement, and we must do more as a nation to ensure that due process rights are guaranteed for all citizens regardless of race."" She continued, ""However, Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes calling over 2 million Michiganders ""racist"" is unacceptable and only makes this tragedy worse."" In a separate statement, Cox wrote, ""As representatives for all Michiganders, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Senator Gary Peters must condemn Lavora Barnes' statement immediately. It is time to put the people of Michigan above politics."" PENNSYLVANIA With the clock ticking on the deadline for counties to receive mail-in ballots in for the June 2 Pennsylvania primary, Governor Tom Wolf said he would extend their deadline by a week, reports CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. ""I can't do anything about the election date, but I am extending the time to actually get votes in,"" Wolf said in a press conference in Philadelphia. In the first year of no-excuse mail-in voting in the state, over 1.8 million Pennsylvanians applied to vote by mail, straining local elections boards with nearly 18 times the number of voters who applied to do so in the 2016 primary. As of Monday morning, counties had processed over a million mail-in ballots, but over a third remained. Wolf's decision came after counties and voting rights advocates argued voters who applied toward the deadline to apply for mail-in voting could end up without enough time to get their ballots in before election day. Pennsylvania residents had until May 26, a week before the primary election, to apply for mail-in ballots, leaving only a week for their ballot to be issued and returned. The issue has been playing out across court levels in the state. Counties across the state have installed drop-off boxes for mail-in ballots, and voters who applied for mail-in ballots but didn't mail back can file a provisional ballot in person. But there will be far fewer polling places in the state, since the State Department approved a 60% polling place cut across all counties and major polling place slashes for the state's largest counties, from 831 to 190 in Philadelphia and by nearly 90 percent in Allegheny. WISCONSIN The Wisconsin Supreme Court today agreed to hear a case that could take about 130,000 voters off of the state's voter rolls before the November election, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The case involves voters who the state believes may have moved and haven't responded to a mailing from October 2019 either confirming they stayed at a location or registered at a new address. The letter was initially sent to about 230,000 voters last fall, but some have confirmed their address, re-registered at a new address or been removed from the active voter list for other reasons. A county court initially ruled to remove the voters from the rolls, but the state appeals court overturned that decision in February. The Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked earlier this year on whether to hear the case before the appeals court weighed in. In late April, conservative Justice Dan Kelly announced he would be participating in the case once again, since the April election where he was on the ballot had passed. One interesting angle for the case is the schedule for filing briefs. The court is allowing up to 60 days for briefs to be filed and if the full time is used, there could be a new justice on the bench. Liberal Justice Jill Karofsky will be sworn in on the court on August 1 to replace Kelly. That would narrow the conservative edge on the court to a 4-3 majority. If the court rules to remove the voters, they could still re-register in time for the November election, but some activists have said it's more difficult to do so during the coronavirus pandemic. The case will be closely watched. since Wisconsin's 2016 presidential election was decided by about 23,000 votes.",0.0

""I will fight to protect you — I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" Mr. Trump said. While only states can activate the National Guard, Mr. Trump said he would deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of heavily armed soldiers to Washington D.C. About 200 troops were moved out of Fort Bragg to deploy to the Washington area to be ready on short notice if needed, CBS News' David Martin reported. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D.C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" President Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House on Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. AP The president made the announcement amid the backdrop of tear gas and flash bangs on the other side of the White House in Lafayette Park. Shortly before the president spoke and declared himself an ""ally of peaceful protesters,"" demonstrators described as peaceful and journalists across from the White House were tear-gassed, clearing them from the area. Democrats quickly denounced the president's statement. ""The fascist speech Donald Trump just delivered verged on a declaration of war against American citizens. I fear for our country tonight and will not stop defending America against Trump's assault,"" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden tweeted. ""These are not the words of a president. They are the words of a dictator,"" Democratic Senator Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter. The president had been criticized by even some of his usual defenders for staying in the White House since his trip to the Florida space station. After his statement, the president and his staff walked through a cleared-out Lafayette Park and took photos in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, whose basement was set ablaze Sunday night. Mr. Trump held up a Bible as he stood in front of the church. Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., said she was ""outraged"" by Mr. Trump's visit to the church. ""The president just used a Bible ... and one of the churches of my diocese without permission as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything our churches stand for ... I am outraged,"" she told CNN afterward. ""The president did not pray when he came to St. John's … nor did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now and in particular, the people of color in our nation who wonder if anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred worth,"" she added White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement that ""the perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Mr. Trump said he is mobilizing ""all available federal resources — civilian and military — to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights."" The Justice Department reiterated that sentiment in a statement later. ""Today, President Trump directed Attorney General Barr to lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,"" Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. ""Beginning tonight, the Department of Justice has deployed all of its law enforcement components – FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals, and BOP – and is closely coordinating with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to maximize federal security presence throughout the District. The Department is working hand-in-hand with the Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol Police, the Federal Protective Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the D.C. National Guard."" The president vowed that George Floyd, whose death sparked many of the protests nationwide, ""will not have died in vain."" Mr. Trump then quickly pivoted to ending the violence the streets, saying the nation is under siege by ill-intended actors and listing some of the criminal acts and vandalism that have taken place across the country over the last several days. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror,"" Mr. Trump said. On a call with governors Monday, the president called them ""weak"" and ""fools"" for not cracking down harder on the civil unrest gripping their cities.",0.0

They also marched to the Empire Mall, where the peaceful protest took an unexpected turn. “They threw a rock at a cop, and then things kind of got a little violent,” Schmidt said. “When I first got there, there was a guy, and he was just taking these huge rocks and throwing them at the police, and he was one of the first people I saw just smash the windows, and we went up to him, and we were like, ‘Excuse me, this is for peace. This is not the time to be violent,'” Alberda said. The two took part in a human barricade between law enforcement and those who weren’t peaceful. “Most of the time we just had our hands in the air and just tried to deflect things that were kind of coming,” Schmidt said. “Me and Bailey kind of communicated to each other to make sure that if we saw a rock, make sure kind of deflecting that, water bottles, deflect them.” “I have the privilege to say something, people are going to listen to me because of my skin color,” Alberda said. “I have the responsibility of having my voice at least in unity with the black people up there as well, protecting and in that human shield.” Their words and their actions didn’t go unnoticed. “That group of protestors who stood in front of us, arms linked, that’s the Sioux Falls I know, right, and that’s the Sioux Falls we know,” Sioux Falls Police Department Lieutenant Jon Thum said.

Charges included burglary, arson, aggravated assault, rioting, looting, defacing public property and violating curfew. There were protests throughout the country over the weekend stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security issued an alert on Thursday warning that violent protest movements will grow and domestic violent extremists and others will seek to take over government facilities and attack law enforcement, a law enforcement source told CBS News senior investigative reporter Pat Milton. While a number of local officials said they felt the violence was started by people coming in from outside areas, none of the cities that reported that data saw a sizeable number of out of town arrests. In Miami, where local officials told the public that most of the ""agitators"" were ""outsiders,"" only 9 out of the 92 people arrested had out-of-state addresses. Police officers arrest a demonstator Sunday, May 31, 2020, in Los Angeles, during a protest over the death of George Floyd, who died May 25 after he was pinned at the neck by a Minneapolis police officer. Ringo H.W. Chiu / AP The three most populous cities in the country — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — had the most arrests, but those cities did not provide data for ""out-of-town"" arrests. In Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti imposed a curfew and asked Governor Gavin Newsom to deploy the National Guard, 1,600 people were arrested over the three-day period, the most of any city. Roughly 1,000 guard personnel began arriving overnight Sunday, and Newsom announced Monday an additional 1,100 National Guard troops would deployed to cities throughout the state. Over 400 people were arrested in neighboring Santa Monica, the police department said. Chicago had the second-most arrests with 699. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the majority of the arrests were for looting, and 461 of those arrests came from the South and West sides, CBS Chicago reported. A total of 132 officers were injured. There were 48 shootings, 17 people killed and more than 64 guns recovered on Sunday, Brown said. It was not immediately clear how many of those shootings and fatalities were related to the protests. The Minneapolis Department of Public Safety said there were 481 arrests in the city, where protests first began six days ago. The U.S. Attorney's office said Monday it had charged Illinois resident Matthew Lee Rupert, 28, with causing civil disorder, a riot and possessing unregistered explosive devices. The charges allege Rupert was trying to stoke chaos during Friday night's protests. There were 398 people arrested in New York City, where a curfew wasn't declared until Monday. Other cities with arrests included Phoenix, where police said more than 300 were arrested, Richmond, Virginia, where at least 233 people were arrested, and Dallas, where 191 people were arrested. At least 40 people were arrested at demonstrations on Sunday in Louisville, Kentucky, where protests have erupted over the death of Breonna Taylor. Taylor was in bed with her boyfriend when three plainclothes police detectives entered her home in March. Gunfire erupted and Taylor was killed. A black business owner was shot and killed by police Sunday night in Louisville. CBS affiliate WLKY reported police said they were trying to clear a large crowd in a parking lot. But officers body cameras were not activated, and Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad was fired on Monday and both officers involved were placed on administrative leave.

""It only takes one person to do something foolish, to start something foolish. And that's really hard to manage no matter who you are,"" Hariri said.

Hariri said he understood the anger the demonstraters felt but urged them to channel it in a more constructive way. ""The problem is, often times when someone is angry we want them to be calm.

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said.

And then it became clear. President Trump wanted to walk from the White House through the park to the Episcopal church. Camera crews scrambled to keep up with him as he strode through the park, followed by his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, along with Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials. Trump stopped briefly outside the church and held up a Bible. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" he said. ""Keep it nice and safe."" The visit came just after Trump delivered remarks at the White House, declaring himself ""your president of law and order"" and demanding that governors deploy National Guard units and ""dominate the streets."" St. John's Church opened in 1816 and is known as ""the Church of the Presidents,"" having hosted every U.S. president since James Madison. On this occasion, however, the president's visit was unannounced, and church authorities were furious that the White House did not bother to alert them. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" said the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Episcopal bishop of Washington, with oversight responsibilities for the church. When the president held up the Bible, without praying or quoting a verse appropriate for the moment, Budde was further incensed. ""It almost looked like a prop,"" she told NPR. ""That is the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks messages of love, of God, love of neighbor. I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way."" The church has long been known for its support of social justice causes, and in the hours before the president showed up, clergy and lay volunteers had been ministering to the protesters in the plaza. Protests, some of them violent, had occurred around the church on previous nights, and the church was briefly in danger on Sunday after a fire started in the church basement. The Bible teaches us to love God and our neighbor; that all people are beloved children of God; that we are to do justice and love kindness. The President used our sacred text as a symbol of division. — Mariann Budde (@Mebudde) June 2, 2020 A former St. John's minister, Gini Gerbasi, was among those attending to the protesters in front of the church when the police moved in. ""We were literally DRIVEN OFF of the St. John's, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. ""PEOPLE WERE HURT SO THAT [President Trump] COULD HAVE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH!!! HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO STEP OVER THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES WE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE WERE BEING TEAR GASSED!!!!"" In a statement Monday evening, the Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joined in the criticism of Trump's visit. ""This evening, the President of the United States stood in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, lifted up a bible, and had pictures of himself taken,"" Curry said. ""In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us."" The church visit was praised, however, by a member of Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board, the Rev. Johnnie Moore. ""I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly & in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette Square to St. John's Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,"" Moore tweeted.

Rumors of vans hauling out-of-state rioters and looting sparked contention in Rapid City Monday. Police weren’t able to confirm the protest, but took preemptive measures. Nearly 300 peaceful protesters-mostly young locals-ended up marching through a heavily policed downtown area. Rumors of a riot scheduled for 6p.m. downtown built a palatable tension in the city. Law officers lined every corner of the street. Some store owners and adults opposing the riots sat in front of businesses-some yielding baseball bats and guns. At 6p.m. people slowly started gathering to protest, many of them teenagers. Within an hour, almost 300 young people were peacefully chanting in front of the courthouse. Police officers followed the group everywhere, making sure that antagonizers shouting things from their car didn’t lead to violence, and even blocking off the streets with department cars and cones for the group to march safely. The whole event stayed peaceful-and that was intentional. The organizer is 16 year old Carly Siers from Rapid City. “I actually got death threats when I planned this out. People were messaging me telling me they’re going to find out where I live, that they’re going to kill me, they’re going to murder my whole family for me organizing this, organizing a peaceful protest.” She says it was disturbing because many of the messages were from older people. She says young people need to fight for their future. “This is for George and all the police brutality that’s been unspoken of. I am speaking for the silence, I am speaking for the unspoken.” Rumors still circulated during the protest of massive groups of counter protesters. Brendyn Medina does communications for the Rapid City Police Department. “There have been so many rumors flying around today, it’s been hard to keep up with just how many of them there are. Obviously, we can see that there’s one demonstration going on, this is the only one I’m aware of and it’s going just the way it should.” Organizers of the protest mentioned plans for a second peaceful protest Tuesday night.",0.0

In New York City, largely peaceful demonstrations were punctuated by people smashing storefront windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors to the storied Macy’s store on 34th Street, leaving the major Manhattan thoroughfare littered with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Just happened: a protest in a car run over a group of cops in Buffalo NY…Some of them might be dead  #BlackLivesMatter #protests2020 pic.twitter.com/UraxbRhMuV — Yousef NH (@YousefNH2) June 2, 2020 Demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day that Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the location where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest began to mount, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. The police chief in Louisville was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by security forces during unrest early Monday. Military helicopters flying dangerously low over crowds in Washington, DC pic.twitter.com/KmjMhRjCY1 — Michael Pegram (@MichaelNBC12) June 2, 2020 An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas, where police have made 338 arrests during three nights of violence that followed peaceful protests earlier in the day. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. The latest wave of protests came on the day that Trump portrayed himself as hard-nosed, law-and-order president and police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump emerged after two days out of public view and threatened in remarks from the White House Rose Garden that he would deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. The photo op was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. The nation has been roiled by violence over the death of Floyd for nearly a week. The protests come after years of seeking police reforms over repeated cases of minorities dying in police custody, and at a time when the country is already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, whose officers have made hundreds of arrests. The president, seeking his second term in office, demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos at the historic house of worship. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him.

As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy's flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. New York police officers park their vehicles outside Macy's store after it was broken into hours after a solidarity rally calling for justice over the death of George Floyd, on June 1, 2020. Wong Maye-E / AP People also rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. ""We worked hard to build up the business, and within a second, someone does this,"" said the owner of a ransacked Manhattan smoke shop, who identified himself only by the name Harri. ""Really bad."" The NYPD confirmed that police made at least 700 arrests through the night, but said they were still tallying the final number. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. They came on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the vandalized stores were already closed due to the pandemic, and now many, especially the mom-and-pop shops that were hit, may never reopen again, points out CBS New York. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifted at 5 a.m. De Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo said the outbreaks of violence the previous two evenings — which left stores ransacked and police vehicles burned — gave them no choice to impose a curfew and boost police presence, even as they insisted they stood with the throngs of peaceful demonstrators who have spoken out for several days against police brutality and racial injustice. ""We can't let violence undermine the message of this moment,"" de Blasio said in a statement. He and Cuomo are Democrats. Big crowds rallied in Times Square and Brooklyn on Monday afternoon and marched through the streets for hours. As in previous days, the demonstrations in daylight were peaceful, with officers mostly keeping their distance from marchers. A nighttime march through Brooklyn was also peaceful, and police let it continue for hours after the 11 a.m. curfew passed. But midtown Manhattan descended into chaos as night fell. There were dozens of arrests, police said. De Blasio tweeted at 1 a.m. that there were also ""real problems"" in the Bronx, which had largely escaped previous nights of unrest unscathed. Video posted on social media showed multiple piles of rubbish on fire on a debris-strewn street and people smashing into stories. Another video showed a group of men beating a police officer who was alone and down on the ground, smashing him with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. Yet another video showed an officer being hit by a car after responding to a report of a break-in at a pawn shop. The drive got away. The officer was in serious but stable condition, police said. After the curfew took effect, police moved more actively to clear the streets, chasing after and knocking down some people who wouldn't comply as they streamed toward Times Square. At the same time, the city's elected public advocate, Jumaane Williams, and some other officials held a news conference in Brooklyn criticizing the curfew. ""In the black community, every time we ask for resources or assistance, they send police,"" said Williams, a Democrat. Earlier in the day, one Times Square demonstrator, Giselle Francisco, considered the curfew necessary. ""There are people who have ulterior motives, and they're trying to hijack the message,"" the New Yorker said. Monday marked the fourth night in a row of mainly peaceful daytime demonstrations, chaotic nights, hot spots of violence and arrests, with the mayor's daughter among those arrested over the weekend. Chiara de Blasio, 25, refused to leave a Manhattan street officers were clearing Saturday because people were throwing things. She was released with a court summons. Her father said Monday she told him she'd behaved peacefully and believed she had followed officers' instructions. ",0.0

Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters in an overnight briefing that the demonstrations ""led to"" both incidents.

While trying to detain some people, Lombado said, ""a shot rang out and our officer went down."" The officer was on life support and a suspect was in custody. Downtown, city police and federal officers were posted at the stairs of the federal building to protect it from protesters when a man with ""multiple firearms who appeared to be wearing body armor"" reached for a firearm, Lombardo said. He was shot by an offier and pronounced dead at a hospital. ""This is a sad night for the (local police) family and a tragic night for our community,"" Lombardo said.

Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn't breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before he stopped moving. Police in Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of demonstrations. Officers used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds late Saturday downtown and Sunday on the Las Vegas Strip. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanor crimes to receive court summonses instead of time behind bars to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

(KCCR) – People protesting the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police took to the State Capitol steps Tuesday and peacefully advocated their views. Many in the crowd of around 60 held signs supporting the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement. Protesters sat mostly quiet on the retaining wall along the sidewalk of Capitol Avenue near the first set of steps from the sidewalk to the Capitol steps talking among themselves and waving to honking motorists. Some drivers and vehicle occupants shouted out against the protest with no reaction from those assembled. Around 6 p.m., the protester began a march west on Capitol Avenue. Law enforcement was heavy across the city. A group of armed business owners were perched outside their businesses along South Pierre Street. Joining them were Pierre police, South Dakota Highway Patrol and National Guard members. As of 5 a.m. South Dakota National Guard soldiers could still be seen pacing around both the Governor’s Mansion and State Capitol Complex. There have been no reports so far of any overnight criminal activity connected to the protest.",0.0

The reporter and her cameraman were covering a protest outside the White House — part of the groundswell of public anger over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. ""We have asked the Australian embassy in Washington D.C. to investigate this incident,"" Marise Payne said after the journalists were shoved, punched and hit with a baton live on television. ""I want to get further advice on how we would go about registering Australia's strong concerns with the responsible local authorities in Washington."" Australia's 7News reporter Amelia Brace told her network that both she and her cameraman Tim Myers were left ""pretty bruised, but okay"" after their encounter with police in riot gear outside the White House. ""It all happened so quickly,"" Brace said of the Monday incident. ""We were at some distance, expecting a crackdown at curfew time... but their surge took everyone by surprise,"" she told 7News. ""Cameraman Tim Meyers and I are both okay. Pretty bruised, but okay."" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison reached out to the network to check on the journalists and has asked his government to push for an investigation. The network said his government offered its support should the crew wish to pursue a formal complaint against the police through the Australian Embassy in Washington. CNN reporter talks about his arrest during Minneapolis protest There have been other incidents, including at least one captured on live television, in which news crews identifying themselves clearly to police have been placed under arrest. Other videos have shown police appearing to deliberately target members of the media covering the protests. The non-profit group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Monday that at least 125 press freedom violations had been reported nationwide by journalists covering the demonstrations, which have devolved into violence, looting and destruction in multiple cities in recent nights. Multiple police and other law enforcement officers have been shot amid the chaos. But the arrests of and violence against journalists by law enforcement officers covering the protests is something the United States has not seen during previous waves of unrest over police killings. ""We are horrified by the continued use of harsh and sometimes violent actions of police against journalists doing their jobs. These are direct violations of press freedom, a fundamental Constitutional value of the United States,"" CPJ Program Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in the statement released Monday. ""We call on local and state officials to explicitly exempt the news media from curfew regulations so that journalists are able to report freely."" The U.K. government voiced concern about the treatment of journalists covering the protests on Monday. The official spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the attacks on journalists ""very concerning"" after a BBC News crew's camera operator was charged by an officer in riot gear in Washington D.C. ""Journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authority to account without fear of arrest or violence,"" said spokesman James Slack. Last week a freelance photographer in Minneapolis was reportedly blinded in one eye by a rubber bullet fired by police.

The county said Monday evening that Arlington County Police Department officers who were assisting with the response to the protests left the District of Columbia around 8:30 p.m. ""at the direction"" of the county manager, county board and police chief. ""The county is re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations,"" the county said. Libby Garvey, a member of the Arlington County county board, said on Twitter she was ""appalled"" that the ""mutual aid agreement [was] abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op."" We ordered @ArlingtonVaPD to immediately leave DC. Appalled mutual aid agreement abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op. — Libby Garvey (@libbygarvey) June 2, 2020 Protesters and members of the media gathered outside the White House gates Monday afternoon and into the early evening, ahead of the district's 7 p.m. curfew, to protest the death of George Floyd for a seventh day. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes while he was prone on the pavement. For the final minutes the officer's knee was pressed to Floyd's neck, the 46-year-old was unresponsive. Floyd's death has sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and the deaths of unarmed African Americans at the hands of law enforcement. In the District of Columbia, mostly peaceful daytime demonstrations have given way to some violence and vandalism after sunset. On Sunday night, stone barriers and statues outside the White House in Lafayette Park were spray painted, and part of St. John's Church, known as the ""Church of the Presidents"" and located across from the White House, was set on fire. But on Monday, the peaceful protest turned chaotic when police outside the White House used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse protesters. After the area was cleared, Mr. Trump, flocked by a contingent of Cabinet members, aides and Secret Service, left the White House to walk across Lafayette Park to St. John's Church. Once there, Mr. Trump stood for photos and held up a Bible, but did not pray or read from it. Garvey, the chair of the Arlington County board, told CBS News the actions taken to disperse protesters were ""evil and wrong."" ""This was an abuse and perversion of the mutual aid agreement. You have an agreement with someone and suddenly you find yourself in a very different situation than what you agreed to,"" she said. ""We're not having our officers put in danger for a photo-op."" Arlington County has a mutual aid agreement with the National Park Service under which police will assist in large-scale events like an inauguration or demonstrations. Garvey said the National Park Service requested assistance from Arlington County for the protests in downtown Washington several days ago, and the county agreed to send officers for a short time. In earlier protests, Garvey said Arlington police were primarily relieving other officers when needed and operating in the background. But that changed Monday evening, as photos emerged of Arlington County Police Department officers in protective gear helping to disperse the crowd of protesters from Lafayette Park, after which Mr. Trump walked across the area. The county then decided to withdraw its officers. ""The idea of mutual aid is to protect people and you help people and you do the right things. This was just an absolute abuse,"" Garvey said, adding it was a ""breach of trust."" Law enforcement officers hold a perimeter near the White House during protest on June 1, 2020 in Washington, D.C.

(Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) As the national protests over the death of George Floyd made their way to South Dakota over the weekend, the state’s sports figures watched intently. South Dakota is one of the whitest states in the U.S., with 86.5 percent of the population made up of non-Hispanic whites, but the sports arena is one of the few areas where some diversity exists. For black athletes in South Dakota, who play almost exclusively for white coaches in front of white fans, protests against police misconduct and racism have sparked emotion during what was already a politically charged era. For much of the last few years, players and coaches on both sides of the political aisle have mostly let their differences exist below the surface. Politics and current events are rarely addressed on social media, instead replaced by feel-good messages about tolerance, coexistence and putting differences aside for the pursuit of a common goal. But as both peaceful protests and acts of vandalism dominate the nation’s consciousness, more and more players, athletes and administrators here in South Dakota are speaking up. Buy Photo Former SDSU running back Mikey Daniel talked about racism and reactions to national protests. (Photo: Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader) Mikey Daniel, a running back from Brookings who played at South Dakota State and signed with the Atlanta Falcons, has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks. He’s challenged his friends and fans to listen to him and others like him just as much when they talk about their experiences as black Americans as they do when he’s scoring touchdowns. “I’m not with all the looting and the rioting and the destroying of communities – I’m not,” Daniel said. “But the people making such a big deal about the looting and destroying of communities are the same people that are saying let’s protest peacefully, and are the exact same people that when Colin Kaepernick was peacefully taking a knee, using his platform to spread awareness throughout the country about what’s really going on and things that we battle with every single day, those same people wanted to have an issue with that and flip the narrative talking about, ‘Oh, well, we’re disrespecting America, we’re disrespecting the flag, we’re disrespecting veterans.' It had nothing to do with any of that, and everything to do with the war on race. The same people that are doing that talking are the same people that told LeBron James to shut up and dribble.” Daniel’s former SDSU teammate, Cade Johnson, posted an illustration of Floyd superimposed over a Black Lives Matter flag as his Twitter background photo, and offered his thoughts on the Minneapolis tragedy and its aftermath.

(Photo: Briana Sanchez / Argus Leader) “As others have weighed in on (Floyd) it has really left me feeling confused, angry, and quite sad,” wrote Johnson, who grew up in Nebraska. “My mother and father have always preached these things when raising us. I’m proud to be an American, but I pray the Lord shines his light in times like these. In life it’s called standing up for what you believe in. Everybody has a voice. If you don’t like what’s going on and what people are doing to stand up for what they believe in, you are the problem.” SDSU’s coach, John Stiegelmeier, is a 63-year-old white man from rural South Dakota. But in his 20-plus years as the Jacks coach Stiegelmeier has made efforts to continue to diversify his staff and create an inclusive team atmosphere in which players feel free to celebrate their individuality. SDSU had a team meeting Sunday night to share feelings about the protests. “We had a special team meeting last night with a number of our black coaches and athletes speaking from the heart,” Stiegelmeier said on Twitter. “It was powerful. There is a solution to any problem. We each need to do what we can to be part of the solution. Doing nothing is doing nothing. Start with love.” Buy Photo Chris Johnson led USF to the NSIC South title this year (Photo: Argus Leader file photo) Christian Smith is one of SDSU’s black coaches, and in a long statement posted on his Twitter account, the Jacks’ defensive line coach related his experiences with racism as a youth and how it shaped him as a person and now as a coach. “How do we move forward as a country and stop ignoring the racial issues that make everyone uncomfortable? Every individual needs to be seen as the person they are, and not just what they look like,” Smith said. “The black community has always felt inferior or viewed differently and history has repeated itself. The reaction to George Floyd is a cry for help and awareness for things not changing. A lot of hurt, sadness, pain and anger has led us to where we are today. I fully support peaceful protest for the cause of change and we can do that together.” Many white coaches and athletes have expressed empathy for the cause as well, showing support for their black teammates and colleagues while acknowledging their role and their own privileged perspective.

Value all life – period.” USD offensive line coach Andrew Prevost vowed to be more aggressive in speaking out after the Coyote staff had a team meeting to hear each other’s thoughts. “It was humbling to hear our student-athletes speak about the turmoil that is going on in our country regarding racial inequality. I want to say sorry for not speaking up earlier,” Prevost wrote. “As a leader I have a responsibility to address this. It angers me that we can’t figure out how to educate ourselves and treat each other. There is a difference between right and wrong and what is going on in our country is inherent racism and is wrong. I commit to you that I will do everything in my power to further people’s understanding of the injustice going on. I commit to you that I will speak up when I hear something that is wrong. I will stand with you.” Current Nebraska and former USD women's basketball coach Amy Williams. (Photo: Nati Harnik, AP) Coaches are parents, too, and the current turmoil has them reflecting on how to educate at home as well as in the locker room. Former USD women’s basketball coach Amy Williams, now at Nebraska, addressed that concern in her own social media message. “I have cried a lot of tears, prayed a lot, but mostly I have been listening,” Williams said. “Listening to my husband describe how he feels when he is the subject of unjust suspicion. Listening to some of my best friends describe the fear they have raising their beautiful black sons in today’s world. Listening to the players I have been blessed to coach discuss their experiences as black women living among today’s social injustices. Listening to my daughters ask questions about what the color of their skin could cause them to face in their futures. While the protests will eventually end and Floyd's case may finally see justice, those speaking out want to make sure their messages aren't forgotten later on. ""I tell white people protesting and marching –thank you,"" Daniel said. ""We see that. But I hope to God that it's not just a show, not just a thing people are doing and you want to fit in. You have to take that and live that. There's a war on race and that's lived daily, it's not just a one-time thing.

Andy Becker told the Journal Monday morning. Becker said armed civilians preemptively patrolling businesses could actually encourage protesters who had no plans to show up. He also said armed civilians shouldn’t try to help law enforcement if any violent protest does break out. “We need to be able to do our job, to contain the problem and issue, and having folks threatening to take matters into their own hands actually only makes it harder for us to do the job,” he said. Becker spoke to the Journal in the parking lot outside of the old Sears at the Rushmore Mall where several dozen members of the Defend RCPD/Rapid City Facebook group gathered at 11 a.m. The members — some carrying handguns on their belts — were met by Becker, the department's community relations specialist, a deputy from the Pennington County Sheriff's Office and the mall manager.",0.0

(KELO) — Peaceful protests gave way to criminal acts Sunday night in Sioux Falls. Monday, Governor Kristi Noem met with city leaders, law enforcement, and victims. Governor Kristi Noem says protests have a purpose, and that Sunday’s peaceful protests honored the memory of George Floyd, but then the agenda changed. “Today, the conversation isn’t about the peaceful protest, it’s about the violence that happened last night, and violence will not be tolerated in South Dakota,” Governor Kristi Noem said. Noem says mob rule does nothing to honor victims. After police officers had rocks and obscenities tossed their way, authorities say the criminal acts spilled into the private sector. “Property was destroyed, business owners were victimized, stores were looted and vandalized,” Noem said. The governor, alongside Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, visited with victims Monday, including a stop at Riddle’s Jewelry, where an estimated $45,000 worth of theft and damage occurred. “These aren’t protesters that did these actions last night, these are violent criminals, do not call them protesters,” Noem said. Noem says change only happens if we create change, and has charged her team with finding solutions through legislative action. “We have been having this conversation about race and inequality for decades in this country and a lot of politicians and public figures stand up and talk, and frankly I’m more interested in what we can do,” Noem said. Despite last night’s violence, Noem says a vast majority of South Dakotans made the right decision. “There is no other governor in this country that has trusted her people more than I have, and I still do trust the folks of this state,” Noem said. The governor says she’s aware of planned protests in other South Dakota cities, and is working to help make sure those protests remain peaceful.",0.0

Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, who oversees the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., told ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday that she wasn't informed in advance that the president would visit. She called Mr. Trump's photo-op a ""symbolic misuse of the most sacred texts of our tradition."" ""After speaking so harshly and with militaristic overtones to the nation, he had the park of peaceful protesters cleared with tear gas and officers in riot gear to make a symbolic gesture, holding a Bible as if to spiritually condone a message and a posture that is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything as a church we stand for,"" Budde said.

""The President did not come to pray; he did not lament the death of George Floyd or acknowledge the collective agony of people of color in our nation. He did not attempt to heal or bring calm to our troubled land,"" she tweeted. Before his stop, Mr. Trump said he would deploy the military against protesters if local officials couldn't stop violence that has broken out in some U.S. cities. ""I will fight to protect you — I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" Mr. Trump said. However, prior to his speech, peaceful demonstrators and journalists across from the White House were tear-gassed, clearing them from the area. After his statement, the president and his staff walked through a cleared-out Lafayette Park and posed for pictures in front of St. John's Church. Reverend Gina Gerbasi, a former rector at St. John's, told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV that she along with other clergy were tear-gassed. She was handing out medical supplies to Black Lives Matter protesters when federal law enforcement started throwing flash bombs. She said Mr. Trump needs to ""start behaving like a Christian instead of selling yourself as one."" ""And it would be far more Christian if he would behave according to the words in that book instead of just carrying it around with him as a prop,"" she told WUSA. According to Budde, the last time Mr. Trump was at the church was the morning after his inauguration and wasn't aware of any times he's attended the church after that.

On Monday afternoon, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan kneeled in solidarity with protesters. But he denounced looting, which marred another day of peaceful demonstrations in the city Monday as many ignored a new curfew. Monahan also said he doesn't believe racism plays a role in the NYPD. ""What happened in Minnesota was an outrage, completely and totally. But 800,000 law enforcement officers around this country are paying the price for what that guy did in Minnesota,"" Monahan told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Tony Dokoupil. Monahan said he understands the protesters' anger. ""Protest, yell, scream, let your rage out, but don't take your rage out on the community, destroy the businesses that actually employ members of this community,"" he said. After violence erupted over the weekend, Monahan and the nearly 40,000 officers he oversees geared up for more protests. Describing the line between a peaceful protest and out of control, he said, ""bottles and rocks thrown at my cops, windows being broken, stores being looted ... got no place in American society."" But in recent days, tempers have flared, and the NYPD has faced criticism for some of the responses by officers. ""You have to look at the entire incident. You have to look at the rocks being thrown, the injuries to my officers, what happened before, what precipitated that event,"" Monahan said. ""Knowing that we had a commanding officer trapped in his car, his last transmission was, 'This may be my last transmission,' dragged out of that car. This is what's going through a cop's mind as he gets surrounded."" As Monahan checked in with his team Monday afternoon, things remained peaceful. Responding to a theory that when the NYPD armors up and looks like the military, that's when protesters get wild, Deputy Chief John D'Adamo said, ""No, it's usually reactive. Usually, we're going to suit up after we say that the temperature has gone up. Okay? If they're yelling and screaming, that's fine. But when bottles start coming, I gotta put the helmets on. I gotta get the shields out to protect my guys."" The show of force is hard to miss for protesters like Shataysha Byrd. ""I am devastated. I am disgusted. We just want justice for our people. The same how anyone else would. It's all we care for,"" she said. Byrd said she doesn't believe the police when they say that they want to have a light touch and de-escalate. ""I mean, you see them behind us, right? I came today in flip-flops, ripped jeans and a shirt. I have no need or no desire to want to fight, to want to get pepper-sprayed down, to want to be tied, but I am prepared because I will fight for my people by any means necessary,"" she said. Monahan said he believes the ""vast majority"" of people causing trouble are coming from outside of New York. ""We have a lot of encouragement from outsider agitators telling people to go out and cause mayhem in the city, ... using, I think, this movement for an agenda to end policing throughout the country, an anarchist agenda,"" Monahan said. ""That's what they do. All the signs that you see is defund policing, no more police."" As Monahan watched things unfold from the ground, Deputy Chief Edward Mullane had a different view from the surveillance cameras feeding into a command center at police headquarters. ""This is mob mentality. This has nothing to do with peaceful protests, trying to right injustice,"" Mullane said. Asked about the people walking peacefully down the street, Mullane told Dokoupil, ""We don't like people walking in the middle of the street. We like the rights of everybody else who wants to drive in Manhattan."" But many Americans clearly believe this is the way to get attention as they press for systemic change. ""What role does racism play in these outcomes where you have black men dying at a greater rate than other populations at the hands of police?"" Dokoupil asked Monahan. ""I don't believe racism plays a role in New York. I can only speak for what I've seen in New York City,"" Monahan said. ""And yet, you've got these outcomes.

1623455086,2020-06-02 12:18:48,What is the Insurrection Act?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/insurrection-act-1807-president-trump-deploy-military-troops/,en,False,,152133,kotaradio.com,http://kotaradio.com/,"On Monday, President Trump said he would deploy the military against protesters if local officials cannot stop violence that has erupted in some areas. Only states can activate the National Guard, so many questioned whether the president has the legal authority to deploy troops in American cities. There are circumstances where a president can do so under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which has been amended several times in the years since. According to the law, posted online by the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School: ""Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion."" Past presidents have employed the Insurrection Act to send the military to Southern states to ensure court-ordered desegregation of schools in the 1950s and 1960s, and at the request of several states to quell riots in 1968. It was most recently used in 1992, when troops were sent to Los Angeles after the California governor sought federal help during the riots following the police acquittal in the beating of Rodney King. Still, Mr. Trump's comments about sending in troops put him in conflict with some state officials, who disputed that the president can send troops against their will. ""The President of the United States is not a dictator, and President Trump does not and will not dominate New York state,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James tweeted on Monday. ""We will guard the right to peaceful protest & will not hesitate to go to court to protect our constitutional rights during this time & well into the future."" ""On the legal side, the 1981 Reagan Justice Department concluded that the Insurrection Act does not give the federal government or president unlimited powers, it has to be done in concert with governors,"" CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett said on ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned the idea of using the military, urging that ""governors, mayors, and police chiefs should listen to protesters — and ignore the president."" ""We do not need authoritarian tactics like military intervention to silence dissent,"" the ACLU tweeted. ""We need the political will to dismantle the deep-seated racism and inequity that permeates our institutions — especially our police departments."" Our country's strength lies in our willingness to take to the streets and demand better from our leaders. Governors, mayors, and police chiefs should listen to protesters — and ignore the president. — ACLU (@ACLU) June 2, 2020 During his speech Monday evening in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said, ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" He called himself the ""president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters."" But as the president was speaking, peaceful protesters across from the White House in Lafayette Park were met with tear gas and flash bangs as police cleared the area. Just a few minutes later, Mr. Trump walked through the park with a group of White House aides and reporters in tow and stopped to hold up a Bible in front of the historic St. John's Church — a photo-op that drew condemnation from the Episcopal bishop. Democrats quickly denounced the president's remarks. In a tweet, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden called the speech ""fascist,"" sand said it ""verged on a declaration of war against American citizens."" ""These are not the words of a president. They are the words of a dictator,"" Senator Kamala Harris tweeted. Could Trump invoke the Insurrection Act to send in troops? But despite the criticism, CBSN legal contributor Keir Dougall said there are cases when a president could legally send in troops against a state's wishes. ""President Eisenhower used the Insurrection Act in 1957 to integrate Little Rock High School without the approval of then-Arkansas Governor Orville Faubus,"" Dougall said. ""The president does not need the approval of the state to implement or use the Insurrection Act."" ""Could the state governor or legislature order the National Guard to oppose the U.S. military forces from entering the state? I don't even want to consider that possibility. At that point, you're talking about another Civil War,"" he added. Dougall, a lawyer and former federal prosecutor, said the preconditions for implementing the Insurrection Act require that local and state law enforcement has broken down and some sort of violence is obstructing the execution of state law. ""That's pretty loose. That's sort of in the eye of the beholder,"" Dougall said. ""If the president considers that that condition exists and that people's rights cannot be enforced ... that's it. The president can order federal troops in.""",0.0

It’s not surprising that protests quickly emerged, not only in the Twin Cities but in cities large and small from coast to coast, including South Dakota. Stories and images of these protests have emerged. They include the rioting, looting and violence as extremists hijacked the peaceful protests causing major disruption, violence and horrific damage to property. We know this because journalists have been telling this unfolding story as residents in scores of communities continue to react to Floyd’s death. Sadly, some journalists themselves have become victims of violence and unjustified police harassment and detention. A CNN crew was arrested in the Twin Cities while giving a live television report Friday morning. In Louisville, Kentucky, a crowd swarmed a television photographer and knocked him to the ground, laughing and taking pictures of him. In that same city, a police officer fired more than a half-dozen non-lethal PepperBall rounds that hit a television reporter and photojournalist. A television photographer in Minneapolis was taken into custody by the Minnesota State Patrol Saturday night. On Sunday, police arrested a Des Moines Register reporter while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Time and again, journalists identified themselves to law enforcement as “press” and flashed their news media credential badges, but to no avail. Last weekend, Bruce D. Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, made the following statement: “The numerous, targeted attacks that journalists reporting on protests across the country have faced from law enforcement over the last two nights are both reprehensible and clear violations of the First Amendment. These attacks not only endanger our free press, but also threaten our democracy and the essential role that journalists play in safeguarding constitutional rights. “Many of these attacks were captured on live broadcasts. The video evidence showing journalists under police assault simply for doing their jobs is harrowing. We strongly condemn these actions and will be contacting law enforcement in each jurisdiction to demand a full explanation and accountability for officers who knowingly targeted journalists. “We also condemn all attacks on reporters by protesters. Media coverage of the demonstrations is indispensable to helping our nation bear witness. Assaults on journalists from protesters are unlawful and make it harder for reporters to keep the country informed during this period of civil unrest.” It’s a shame we need a statement like this. Sadly, this does not come as a surprise. President Donald Trump has used Twitter to seed mistrust of journalists. Not only has he called legitimate, credible news organizations “fake news” and the “lamestream media,” he also personally insults and demeans reporters to their faces. Attacking the press has become a key element in his political playbook. You can’t directly link the president’s verbal attacks on the press with the physical attacks we’ve seen in recent days; he did not tell people to do that. But the words President Trump uses and the attitude he promotes have impact. Those sentiments and the constant barrage of those verbal attacks encourage, empower and enable the mistrust of journalists. Journalists have thick skin and will continue to do their jobs. But I fear for our culture, our social fabric and our democracy. At its essence the work of journalism is to gather information and inform the public. That means sharing objective, truthful facts and information; not spin, not political rhetoric, not prepackaged sound-bites; the truth. That’s why America’s founders enshrined a free press in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights. It is the essential difference between a democracy and a dictatorship. Journalism is not perfect. Journalists are not perfect. But the ideals we promote – truth and accountability – are essential. Journalism has never been more important than at this moment. We need to protect it from those who, by word and deed, seek to diminish or destroy it. So where do we go from here? Dialogue – earnest conversation among journalists, elected and law enforcement officials – is a logical first step. We need conversation and training at every level – local, state and national. It’s important that government and law enforcement officials better understand the roles and responsibilities of journalists under the First Amendment. It’s also important that journalists better understand the work and responsibilities of elected and law enforcement officials. We all need to understand what’s at stake and why a fair, free press doing its job unfettered is so important today in America.",0.0

In many conversations, my black young adult children have shared with me their perspective. People stopped me in the grocery store wanting to know my opinion. Some community members remarked, “We just need to move on.” Talking about race in a small, predominantly white community is difficult. Unsure of what to say, we feel awkward. Many of us may feel disconnected from racism because we don’t experience it. It is not a stretch to state that most people in our community may not know any black people, either as a casual acquaintance or a close friend. White Americans often suggest we are “color blind.” We mean that we “treat people equally”; we “don’t see color.” An often well-intentioned notion, we may discover that we define “color” by our “white” terms. Unfortunately, claiming “color blindness”may shield us from confronting our own fears that lead to bias and discrimination. As a white woman, even as a white parent of black children, I will always be incapable of fully understanding the experience of being black. I do appreciate that looking through a black person’s lens, a “color blind” world does not exist, because for the most part, a person of color lives in a world where opportunities many of us take for granted fall outside a color spectrum they can see or experience. But far more egregious than “opportunity” is the deprivation of the basic human need to feel safe, secure. My husband says when he had “The Talk” with our black son, it was a necessary, but sad moment. “The Talk” is when, usually a black parent, has to tell his or her child that he can’t run through a parking lot after dark, or wear a hoodie when the sun goes down, and to remember to keep his hands on the steering wheel if he gets pulled over for speeding and never make any quick moves to get the proof of car insurance. The “Talk” explains that most police officers have the highest sense of integrity, and these officers take their oath with honor and sincerity. “But, please son realize that you will not be seen by some law enforcement the same way as your white friends.” When a white father tells his black son this, it cuts both of them. I also know that there are noble, well-intentioned police officers who are angered by what happened, and who are hurt by the misrepresentation of their profession. Solidarity is more than cheering from the sidelines or posting a social media message of support (which I did). Solidarity is also not violence, or arson, or looting. Instead, solidarity requires me to stand with the marginalized. Priest Greg Boyle calls this “radical kinship."" Radical kinship starts with recognizing that I am different from you. I will never be able to experience life as a person of color. I must start by telling my black children, “I can’t tell you what it is like to be black in America. But I know this, I love you, and I will stand with you. And, my hope for you is that you will always have the courage to love those different from you.” Suggesting that we just “move on” will not help solve the challenges that lie before us. If we truly want to work to solve these problems, we need to be willing to step outside of our comfort zones, and that may require stepping deep inside of ourselves, to even the shadowed parts of our souls. If we are truly honest with ourselves, then we need to try to answer this question: “Why do I want basic human rights of legal justice, security, education, employment, shelter, and social contribution for people who are not like my race, my gender, my citizenship, my sexual-orientation, my mental and physical health, my age, my language, my religious beliefs, or my political values?” If I answer, “I don’t want everyone to have the same basic human dignities,” then I must begin to wrestle with myself for the good of others, because I am part of the problem, not the solution. We are called to become the change we want to see in the world. Let us walk alongside each other together toward human dignity for all, not just in a sign of protest, but transformatively, in a commitment to a more cooperative, perfect union.",0.0

The account's removal was first reported by NBC News. ""This account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts.

A number of employees posted about their frustrations with Zuckerberg's hands-off approach on a rival social media platform, Twitter — which has recently become more proactive about flagging misinformation and violent language by the president. ""I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,"" Facebook employee Jason Toff tweeted. ""Censoring information that might help people see the complete picture *is* wrong. But giving a platform to incite violence and spread disinformation is unacceptable, regardless who you are or if it's newsworthy. I disagree with Mark's position and will work to make change happen,"" tweeted Facebook employee Andrew Crow. ""I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,"" wrote another Facebook employee, Jason Stirman. One employee at Instagram (which is owned by Facebook) said she was taking the day off to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. ""i'm deeply disappointed & ashamed in how the company is showing up the world,"" wrote the employee, Katie Zhu. She encouraged others to join her and ""put your ~$~zuck bucks~$ where ur tweets are"" by supporting black-led organizations. i'm taking PTO from @instagram by @facebook today for #BlackLivesMatter. i'm deeply disappointed & ashamed in how the company is showing up the world rn. fb fam - if u feel similarly, join me & let's organize. put your ~$~zuck bucks~$ where ur tweets are. support Black-led orgs!! pic.twitter.com/TXnD5qPNer — #BLACKLIVESMATTER 🖤 (@ktzhu) June 1, 2020 Their frustration comes after Mr. Trump's social media posts about protests in Minneapolis and across the country in the wake of George Floyd's death became increasingly aggressive. When the president called protesters ""THUGS"" in a tweet and warned ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Twitter quickly tagged the post, saying it ""violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence."" But Zuckerberg declined to take similar steps. The Facebook CEO has long resisted the idea of curtailing free speech on the world's largest social network, even as examples piled up of misinformation and sometimes dangerous and hateful language spreading widely on Facebook. In several Facebook posts this week, Zuckerberg doubled down on the free speech policy. ""I've been struggling with how to respond to the President's tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric,"" he wrote. ""But I'm responsible for reacting not just in my personal capacity but as the leader of an institution committed to free expression. I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,"" his post continued. Zuckerberg said the company did evaluate the presidents' posts about the protests in Minneapolis and determined they did not violate policies. ""Unlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician,"" Zuckerberg wrote. Now, it's clear not all of Zuckerberg's employees are willing to go along quietly. The New York Times, which first reported on the employees' protests, said ""hundreds"" within the company took part. Some participated in a ""virtual walkout"" by taking off of work, since most employees are working from home and cannot physically demonstrate by leaving the office. Many of the employees added an automated email response saying that they were out of the office in a show of protest. In addition, some staff members circulated petitions and wrote about their frustrations both publicly and privately on the company's internal message boards, The Times reports. ""The hateful rhetoric advocating violence against black demonstrators by the US President does not warrant defense under the guise of freedom of expression,"" read an employee's post on an internal message board, which was obtained by The Times. ""Along with Black employees in the company, and all persons with a moral conscience, I am calling for Mark to immediately take down the President's post advocating violence, murder and imminent threat against Black people,"" the employee's post continued. CBS News has reached out to several Facebook and Instagram employees about the demonstration. A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News: ""We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community.

Gregory, the first African American archbishop of the Archdiocese of Washington, condemned President Trump's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine. He said the visit ""violates our religious principles."" ""I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,"" Gregory said in a statement. The shrine is operated independently by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic community organization. ""Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace,"" Gregory continued. Gregory's statement came after the president took photos in front of St. John's Episcopal Church on Monday after peaceful protesters had been cleared out from nearby Lafayette Park with tear gas. Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, who oversees the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., criticized Mr. Trump's photo opportunity at St. John's Church without even stopping to pray. She told ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday that she wasn't informed in advance the president would visit, and called Mr. Trump's photo-op a ""symbolic misuse of the most sacred texts of our tradition."" Republican Senator Ben Sasse on Tuesday condemned Mr. Trump's visit to the church in a statement. ""There is a fundamental—a Constitutional—right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,"" Sasse said. However, some of the president's evangelical allies praised Mr. Trump's visit to St. John's. Robert Jeffress, an evangelical pastor who preached in St. John's for the president's inauguration, condemned ""anarchists"" he said set fire to the historic church on Sunday. The church was damaged by a small basement fire set by protesters on Sunday. ""I believe President Trump was absolutely correct in walking over last evening and standing in front of that church to show his solidarity not only with that congregation but with houses of worship across America,"" Jeffress said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday morning.",0.0

The initiative is the brainchild of Jamila Thomas, senior director of marketing at Atlantic Records and former Atlantic Records employee Brianna Agyemang. However, as the movement grew, most people began using the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday, and activists urged social media users against using #BlackLivesMatter, saying it will drown out vital resources and information for the unaffiliated movement. ""If you use the Black Lives Matter hashtag, use it to share necessary resources and information for the movement. If you are not using it for that purpose, please type out Black Lives Matter with no hashtag, so we do not inadvertently mute vital dialogue in a sea of black boxes,"" the organizers wrote. Agyemang and Thomas are targeting the music industry with their campaign as they believe it is an industry ""that has profited predominantly from black art."" ""Our mission is to hold the industry at large, including major corporations + their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of black people accountable,"" they wrote. The demand for the day of pause has been met with widespread support. Major music labels such as Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Atlantic Records vowed to back the movement. Streaming services such as Apple Music, YouTube and Spotify have also stepped forward. Music giant Spotify pledged to ""stand with black creators,"" with some playlists and podcasts featuring an 8 minute and 46-second long track of silence to acknowledge the amount of time fired officer Devin Chauvin held his knee on the neck of Floyd. Artists and celebrities such as Drake, Katy Perry, Mick Jagger, Quincy Jones, Rihanna and many others have posted the black tile in solidarity. ""It's hard to know what to say because I've been dealing with racism my entire life,"" said legendary producer Quincy Jones. ""My team & I stand for justice. Convos will be had & action will be taken."" While Agyemang and Thomas have addressed the incorrect use of #BlackLivesMatter with their movement, some activists and celebrities have also raised concerns. ""It has come to my attention that many allies are using #BlackLivesMatter hashtag w black image on insta,"" wrote one activist on Twitter. ""We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message. We use hashtag to keep ppl updated."" ""Don't use the tag #BlackLivesMatter.

A Justice Department official told CBS News the decision was made late Sunday or early Monday morning to move the perimeter keeping protesters from getting close to the White House back one block. The official said it was a coordinated decision, and Barr advised it was the correct move. The Washington Post first reported Barr's involvement in extending the perimeter. Demonstrators had assembled in Lafayette Park, located in front of the White House, for a fourth day of protests against the death of George Floyd, 46, and police brutality. While the demonstrations were described as peaceful, tensions escalated when law enforcement deployed tear gas and forcefully pushed protesters from the area. The events occurred as Mr. Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden at the White House, after which he left the compound to make his way through Lafayette Park to visit St. John's Church, whose parish office basement was set on fire after nightfall Sunday. Accompanied by Barr and other Cabinet members, as well as White House aides and Secret Service Monday evening, Mr. Trump stood for photos outside St. John's and held up a Bible. The Justice Department official said the president's movement's did not have any bearing on the decision to extend the perimeter around the White House. Barr went to observe the scene at Lafayette Park after visiting a command center Monday afternoon and was surprised to see it hadn't been moved as intended. The official said Barr then met with police to discuss moving the perimeter. Afterward, officers began pushing protesters from the park. According to the Justice Department official, the attorney general had a bottle thrown at him while visiting the park outside of the White House, and Barr was informed that demonstrators gathered rocks to throw in his direction. CBS could not independently verify whether protesters threw items at Barr. After the events in Lafayette Park earlier Monday evening, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Mr. Trump ""directed Attorney General Barr to lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia."" President Donald Trump pumps his fist toward police as he walks between lines of riot police in Lafayette Park across from the White House while walking to St John's Church for a photo opportunity during ongoing protests over racial inequality in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, at the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 1, 2020. Tom Brenner / Reuters The White House has been criticized for using aggressive tactics to disperse protesters, clearing the area for Mr. Trump to walk from the White House to St. John's, known as the ""Church of the Presidents."" During his comments in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump declared himself ""your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters."" Some Democrats criticized the president's remarks, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said Mr. Trump's ""continued fanning of the flames of discord, bigotry and violence is cowardly, weak and dangerous."" Amid the unrest that has erupted in major U.S. cities in response to Floyd's death last week, the Justice Department has ramped up its law enforcement presence. Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to Miami and Washington, a senior Justice Department official said Monday, and U.S. Marshals and Drug Enforcement Administration agents were deployed to help the National Guard on Sunday during protests at the White House. Barr said Tuesday that ""there will be even greater law enforcement resources and support"" in the Washington, D.C., region Tuesday. ""The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation's capital,"" he said in a statement.",0.0

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced the resolution on Tuesday, saying on the Senate floor that the removal of the protesters was ""appalling"" and ""an abuse of presidential power."" He attempted to pass the measure by unanimous consent, which does not require a vote by the whole Senate but can be blocked by any member. McConnell objected, accusing Democrats of pulling a political stunt in the middle of the crisis sparked by the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee to his neck. Speaking after Schumer, McConnell called Floyd's death a ""heinous act of criminal violence,"" and said ""there's no doubt that residual racism continues to be a stain on our country."" But the Republican leader argued that peaceful protests had been ""hijacked"" by violent riots and looting, and said the Democratic resolution would do nothing to ease tensions. ""Those are the two issues that Americans want addressed: racial justice, and ending riots. Unfortunately, this resolution from my friend the Democratic leader does not address either one of them. Instead, it just indulges in the myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the Democratic side of the aisle,"" McConnell said. McConnell also proposed a resolution affirming the right to peaceful protest and condemning riots which was then blocked by Schumer. The Democrats' resolution would have affirmed the constitutional rights of Americans to peacefully protest, as well as state that violence and looting are unacceptable. It also would have condemned Mr. Trump ""for ordering Federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against the Americans who were peaceably protesting in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC on the night of June 1, 2020, thereby violating the constitutional rights of those peaceful protestors."" A Justice Department official told CBS News that Attorney General William Barr was part of the decision to expand the perimeter around the White House, pushing protesters who were assembled there from the area before Mr. Trump delivered remarks from the Rose Garden. Protesters had gathered for the fourth day of demonstrations in response to Floyd's death and other instances of police brutality. The protests were described as peaceful before law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators and cleared them from the area. After walking across the cleared-out Lafayette Park, Mr. Trump posed for photographs in front of St. John's Episcopal Church while holding the Bible, joined by several members of his cabinet. Senate Republicans largely shied away from criticizing the president's visit to the church Monday evening. Senator Ron Johnson told reporters he ""didn't see it"" when asked about the president's photo op on Tuesday. ""I'm not going to critique other people's performances,"" McConnell said earlier in the day. Senator John Kennedy told reporters at the Capitol that he believed Mr. Trump's visit was ""needed."" ""I thought what the president did in visiting the church was not only appropriate, it was needed, it sent a message to the American people that its government is going to protect the innocent,"" Kennedy said. The church was damaged in a small basement fire set by protesters on Sunday. A handful of Republicans criticized Mr. Trump's behavior. Senator Ben Sasse released a statement saying he was ""against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop."" Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters that ""I did not think that what we saw last night was the America that I know."" Mr. Trump's visit to the church was also condemned by Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, who oversees the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C.

""We cannot have been driven off of that patio with tear gas and horses and concussion grenades, so that that man can have a photo op, in front of a church, holding a Bible,"" Reverend Gini Gerbasi told CBS affiliate WUSA. ""I am so [expletive] offended that he would have the nerve to do that, no one knew about this stunt."" Gerbasi, who served as assistant rector of St. John's Lafayette Square during the Obama administration and has since transferred to a sister church in Georgetown, said she and several other Episcopal clergy members spent the day keeping watch over the historic parish, which had been damaged during previous protests. She said she was handing out medical supplies with Black Lives Matter when troops in full riot gear descended upon the park. President Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. AP Gerbasi wrote on Facebook that the church quickly turned from a holy ground to a battleground and a ""cheap political stunt."" ""I was coughing with tear gas in my clergy collar, and my gray hair, and my old lady reading glasses, so that that man could stand there and hold a Bible in his hand and look Christian,"" Gerbasi told WUSA. ""And it would be far more Christian if he would behave according to the words in that book instead of just carrying it around with him as a prop."" Clergy members said they were not asked permission or told ahead of time that the president wanted to use the church, which is known as ""the Church of the Presidents,"" for the photo. Many said they are outraged over the use of the Bible as a ""prop.""

""The President did not come to pray; he did not lament the death of George Floyd or acknowledge the collective agony of people of color in our nation. He did not attempt to heal or bring calm to our troubled land,"" she tweeted. The Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry also criticized Trump's visit. ""He used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes,"" Curry said in a statement Monday night.

Footage from Sunday showed a tanker truck approaching a throng of people at 70 mph, according to Minnesota Department of Safety Commissioner John Harrington, as protesters frantically tried to avoid being hit. The truck slowly stopped and was then surrounded by protesters who pulled open the driver and passenger doors. Minnesota state police said there were no injuries. CBS Minnesota said some 5,000 protesters were on the interstate at the time. ""Very disturbing actions by a truck driver on I-35W, inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said in a tweet Sunday announcing Vechirko's arrest. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Vechirko told investigators he is grateful no one was hurt, and that the driver was lucky Minnesotans ""showed their better angels"" on that bridge Sunday. Harrington said in a press conference Tuesday that he will work with the county attorney to determine the correct charges to be filed against Vechirko. The driver was originally charged with criminal assault in the second degree. Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) on Tuesday released video leading up to the incident. They were in the process of closing the interstate and the on-ramp used by the trucker hadn't been closed off yet, according to MnDOT. The crowd was part of a protest group marching against the death of George Floyd, and demonstrators had taken position to take a knee on the bridge, CBS Minnesota reports. It had been a relatively peaceful protest up until the point the truck appeared. CBS Minnesota video footage also showed people climb atop the cab of the truck after it had stopped.

(AP) -- Both the states of South Dakota and Nebraska have activated the National Guard after protests turned violent over the weekend. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in took place in Sioux Fall over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. The Argus Leader reports the protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers. Several businesses in the area of the Empire Mall had windows damaged. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members will remain in the city until they are no longer needed While in Nebraska, officials are imposing a curfew and the Nebraska National Guard is being mobilized to help police after a man was killed during a demonstration in downtown Omaha over the death of George Floyd. The shooting occurred at around 11 p.m. Saturday in the city's Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered. Police said they arrested someone within the hour in connection with the shooting of 22-year-old protester James Scurlock. Officials didn't say what led to the shooting during the protests. The protest in downtown Omaha followed one hours earlier a few miles away that started peacefully but devolved into clashes between protesters and police. Over the weekend, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the Minneapolis police officer's handling of George Floyd. Ricketts says Derek Chauvin's actions are an egregious violation of Floyd's rights, and he says the now-fired officer who placed a knee on Floyd's neck should be charged and tried. Ricketts says the incident reflects poorly on law enforcement and creates more distrust between police and communities of color, and he's encouraging protesters to express their anger peacefully.",0.0

PAUL -- Prosecutors charged a St. Paul man with attempted murder Tuesday, June 2, saying he shot at two Minneapolis police officers during unrest in the city after George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody. Over the weekend, there had been peaceful protests in the area of 15th Avenue South and Lake Street in Minneapolis, but there had also been earlier property damage, including the burning of the 3rd police precinct. On Saturday, May 30, about 10:55 p.m., uniformed officers wearing SWAT vests and helmets were in an unmarked van, with the door open, and two were assigned to deploy 40-mm marking rounds to disperse crowds. The van was driving down Lake Street, flanked by two marked squad cars. As they approached 14th Avenue South, a group of people were in a parking lot. Several ran away, but a man — later identified as Jaleel Kevin Stalllings, 27 — walked toward law enforcement. He crouched down as if he was picking something up. Officers said they were concerned something was going to be thrown at them and deployed one marking round at Stallings. An officer “almost immediately … saw three to four gunshot muzzle flashes from Stallings’ chest toward law enforcement,” according to the criminal complaint. “One round sparked and ricocheted in front of officers.” The officer believed a separate officer in front of him had been shot. Another officer saw Stallings fire the shots from hip level at law enforcement; the officer reported fearing for his life and also believed his partner had been shot, the complaint said. Body camera footage corroborated the two officers’ statements. Stallings ran and took cover behind a vehicle and officers approached it from all sides. Stallings resisted arrest and an officer, using physical force, took him into custody, the complaint said. The officer saw an AK-47-style Mini Draco Style pistol near the vehicle’s bumper. Police took a statement from Stallings on Sunday. He asked if anyone had been killed and, when he was told no, said he wanted to speak with an attorney, according to the complaint. The charges against Stallings include two counts of attempted second-degree murder and four counts of assault. An attorney for Stallings was not listed in the court record.  ",0.0

Police officers screen people for COVID-19 before bringing them to jail. Those newly admitted are kept isolated in groups. “Once they get moved to housing, we move them to a particular housing unit that’s been designated for new arrivals. We try to keep them in there for 14 days until we can determine they’re not going to have symptoms, or they do develop symptoms and obviously we are going to have to move them somewhere else,” Gromer said. Even with those measures, there are new cases. “It’s one of those things that makes it so confusing and difficult, is that you’ll have a housing unit that has been fairly well isolated and all of a sudden, somebody will crop up with symptoms and it’s like, seriously, where did that come from?” Gromer said. Despite wearing PPE, eight of the jail staff have also tested positive. Some have since recovered. “Staff has to come and go every day. Staff has the same exposure as everyone else, every day,” Gromer said. Jail staff wearing personal protective equipment.

It’s just a lot of work and it eats up a lot of the time of the day; which then is less time we can allow inmates to be out in that day area,” Gromer said. And that can lead to more unrest behind bars. “The jail environment is stressful under normal circumstances. It’s more stressful for everybody involved now.” Jeff Gromer, Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Gromer says the new Minnehaha County jail, which is set to open in July, will help ease a little of that stress with additional space. The Minnehaha County Jail had to hospitalize one inmate with COVID-19 symptoms. He was released on a PR bond before being admitted to the hospital.",0.0

The new poll also found that 56% of Americans believe the president tweets divide the country, not unite, report CBS News associate producers Eleanor Watson and Sarah Ewall-Wice. The CBS News polling shows that voters have seen more of the president lately than of Joe Biden. About 19% of Americans haven't heard enough about Mr. Trump's response whereas about 42% said they have not heard enough from Biden. Despite his lack of visibility, Biden leads Mr. Trump by 4 points in a head-to-head national matchup in the poll released on Tuesday. Biden has had a 2 to 6 point lead over Mr. Trump since February. This comes as CBS News found 57% believe police treat white people better than black people, including nearly 8 out of 10 black people. At the same time, separate polling by Monmouth University found 57% now believe that when faced with a ""difficult or dangerous situation,"" police are more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black, up from 34% in 2016, and overall, 76% of Americans say that racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States is a big problem, while just 7% say it is not. That poll also found 53% say race relations have gotten worse under Mr. Trump, while just 10% say they have gotten better. Meanwhile, as parts of the country reopen, CBS News polling found 57% believe states reopening over the next few months will make the coronavirus outbreak worse, while only 16% say it will make it better and 27% believe it will have no effect. Americans also continue to believe the virus has a disproportionate impact on minority communities, with 57% saying it will have ""a lot"" of impact on black communities and 52% saying it will have ""a lot"" of impact on Hispanic communities. Only 28% said it would have ""a lot"" of impact on white communities. The majority of Americans still believe the priority should be staying home to stop the spread with 63% to the 37% who believe the priority should be on the economy. Even as stay-at-home restrictions ease, 54% say they'll only go to some public places if they feel safe. Only 19% said they'd go to as many public places as before if those places open. FROM THE CANDIDATES JOE BIDEN In his speech from Philadelphia, Biden said the president was ""part of the problem"" and not the solution in defeating the ""formidable enemies"" of systemic racism and the pandemic health effects, according to CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson and CBSNews.com digital politics reporter Grace Segers. Biden said the anger after George Floyd's death is understandable but he also said this could be a time for unity. If elected, he admitted he would not ""get it right all the time"" but he pledged to not traffic in fear and to not ""fan the flames of hate"" or ""use them for political gain."" The former vice president also ripped Mr. Trump, recommending the president read the Bible he displayed on Monday evening and then telling him to pick up a Constitution to take in the First Amendment. Biden said the country needs more than ""talk"" and needs to vow ""an era of action"" to reverse systemic racism. He said Congress and leaders must make a ""down payment"" on this effort for better policing, adding his voice for the call to ban police chokeholds. Biden may attend George Floyd's funeral next week in Texas, Floyd family attorney Ben Crump told CBS News producer Chris St. Peter. Crump said Biden is welcome to attend and they are awaiting final plans from the campaign. PRESIDENT TRUMP In the wake of Mr. Trump calling himself ""your president of law and order,"" the president's allies cheered. While Republicans remained largely silent as the White House deployed law enforcement to clear out protesters ahead of his photo op before historic St. John's Church, most Trump Republicans offered their approval. Jason Miller, former senior adviser on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, said he found the president's ""symbolic move"" of walking across Lafayette Park to St. John's Church reminiscent of President George W. Bush's visit to the rubble beneath the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. ""Showing that we weren't going to be afraid to retake ground that was ours before, from some act of illegality or terrorism,"" Miller remarked. ""President Trump made that happen last night by appearing in the same place we saw images of the church on fire and absolute chaos the night before."" Longtime Trump ally and Republican GOP chairman Steve Stepanek called the President's photo-op outside St. John's a ""positive"" step in restoring order. ""The President said enough is enough. It's going to stop, and it stops right here."" CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says Trump campaign co-chair, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, however, spoke out against the president's first venture outside White House grounds in 48 hours. ""If your question is should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op, the answer is no,"" Scott told Politico. Republican donor and Trump supporter Dan Eberhart told CBS News that the president did not reach out to all Americans on Monday, but instead addressed the ""Bible Belt,"" in an effort to appear as a strong leader that won't cow to the protests surrounding his home. ""The president takes the protests and destruction around the White House as a personal attack against him,"" Eberhart said. ""The left has been protesting against his presidency from the first day in office. In this instance, he promised justice for Floyd's family, but it did not make a difference. From his perspective, the protests are because he's the president."" The Trump campaign took shots at Biden's address to the nation, today. ""Joe Biden's campaign made it clear that they stand with the rioters, the people burning businesses in minority communities and causing mayhem, by donating to post bail for those arrested,"" Trump campaign senior advisor Katrina Pierson wrote. ""He has obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" The President tweeted out his response. ""Sleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years, and did nothing,"" the President wrote. ""Now he pretends to have the answers. He doesn't even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs, and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW & ORDER!"" VEEPSTAKES TAMMY DUCKWORTH Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois blasted Mr. Trump's Rose Garden address on threatening to deploy the military to quell protests across the nation if local officials cannot eradicate the violence. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Duckworth also addressed peaceful protesters outside the White House being driven out by tear gas so the president could participate in an apparent photo op outside St. John's Episcopal Church. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters is not leadership, it's cowardice,"" Duckworth said in a statement. ""Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" Duckworth added that leaders need to listen to citizens advocating for justice and to ""not silence them with force."" GRETCHEN WHITMER Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer testified before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday on the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The governor said she was grateful for the support the federal government has provided thus far, but she also outlined some challenges the state has faced in obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies. The Democratic governor said that when the state is expecting shipments of supplies from the federal government, the shipment does not ""reflect what we are planning for."" Whitmer said Michigan has the capacity to conduct more tests per day, but added that the lack of a national strategy around testing has inhibited the state from reaching its testing capability. ""Until there's a centralized procurement and allocation with real time information about what's coming so that we can do our planning, it's going to be hard for us to hit those numbers that, that we all know are, are necessary to understanding how fast COVID-19 is so we can prevent the spread,"" Whitmer said. Representative David McKinley of West Virginia, a Republican, grilled Whitmer on waiting until March 26 to request a major disaster declaration from the president and on her state's coronavirus response in nursing homes. Whitmer replied, ""I'm not going to go toe-to-toe with you on every allegation that you've alleged."" Whitmer continued, ""The United States lost valuable time in the early days of COVID-19, when we could have been planning, when there could have been a national strategy, when the use of the DPA could have been used not for meat production, but for swabs, which we still don't have enough of."" The Michigan Republican Party criticized Whitmer's testimony as ""another platform to bash the Trump administration's coronavirus response."" Michigan Republican Party Chairman Laura Cox said, ""Despite her partisan testimony before Capitol Hill today, Michiganders know the truth about Governor Whitmer's actions."" Cox added, ""She has used this pandemic to raise her national profile at the expense of the people of our state who are suffering."" LIFE AFTER 2020 CORY BOOKER Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said he and Harris will be releasing a comprehensive police reform proposal in the coming days, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The proposal, Booker says, takes into account the work of the Congressional Black Caucus and will be centered around police accountability. In his remarks on the Senate floor, Booker said the proposal will create an accountability, and give ""back faith to the people that have lost it."" He continued in his remarks, ""I confess to you even something that's hard to admit, that the spirit and courage and grit being shown by the people on streets, not in the comfortable halls of the Senate—I want to tell you right now that that is not enough. It is essential, but it is not enough. These things are necessary but not sufficient."" NEWSMAKERS PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH President George W. Bush said he is ""anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd,"" in his first statement released Tuesday on the death of the Minneapolis man in police custody, reports CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. The forty-third president noted he has resisted speaking out on the matter because he does not wish to lecture. ""It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures — and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths,"" Mr. Bush. ""It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society?"" In stark contrast to Mr. Trump's remarks Monday from the Rose Garden, the former president called for leaders to listen to the aggrieved. ""Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place."" Mr. Bush wrote ""The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice."" CBS NEWS COVID CHRONICLES EDUCATION Recent college graduate Emily Knell was a weekend away from starting a new job helping struggling elementary students when the coronavirus pandemic put the next phase of her life on hold. ""They cannot really give me any answers as to when I can expect to go back to work,"" she said. ""And since I didn't technically start, I can't get unemployment. I haven't had a paycheck since February."" Knell, who graduated early from Penn State University last summer and moved home to work and pay off student loans before graduate school, said she's now working one day a week for her father and has deferred her student loans. She said the virus has thrown her life into a state of ""limbo."" Millions of students graduating are beginning a new phase of their lives as the coronavirus pandemic shattered the world around them. They're facing the worst job market since the Great Depression, and some companies have even been forced to revoke internships and full-time job offers. CBS News is chronicling what has changed for the life of residents of some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Pennsylvania, over a dozen interviews with students graduating or who recently graduated from college pieced together a mosaic of stories about change, disappointment and uncertainty. New graduates have moved back home mid-semester, lost job opportunities or otherwise had their plans altered by the pandemic. Although change is inherent in graduation at every level, for members of the Class of 2020, the pandemic presents an entirely new level of uncertainty.

CONVENTIONAL WISDOM PARTY PLANNING In the latest development of an ongoing saga about the Republican National Convention being held in Charlotte this fall, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters Tuesday that the likelihood of the gathering being hosted in Charlotte depends on the willingness of the GOP to scale back. ""They have demanded a full 19,000-person crowd at the inside arena in Charlotte. We've continued to say we want to talk with you about a scaled-down convention but we cannot guarantee you that at the end of August, you can have a full arena,"" said Cooper during a press conference Tuesday. ""And we're still waiting for answers to our health questions about how they would take steps to protect people about social distancing and facemasks and we have not heard a response from that."" The press conference came minutes after RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted a statement saying that the RNC has ""an obligation"" to delegates and the president to visit ""multiple cities and states"" that have expressed interest in hosting the event. ""We have now communicated to Governor Cooper's office multiple times that we would like to showcase Charlotte and the wonderful state of North Carolina to the world by hosting the convention we contracted for nearly two years ago,"" tweeted McDaniel. ""It is unfortunate the Governor is dragging his feet on giving us any guidance as to how to move forward with plans to safely conduct our convention…"" Congressional members from both Carolinas joined the North Carolina Republican Party and a state North Carolina representative on Tuesday morning to call on Cooper to outline clear steps for the RNC to take as it plans for the Charlotte-based convention. Republican leaders have called on the Democratic governor to greenlight the party's proposal by tomorrow, June 3. President Trump tweeted Tuesday night that North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper ""forced"" him to seek another state for the convention. Mr. Trump tweeted ""Roy Cooper and his representatives refuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena"" and he said Cooper is still in ""shelter-in-place mode."" Mr. Trump added that the convention would bring in ""millions of dollars"" and ""would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World."" PRIMARILY CONCERNED DELEGATE SITUATIONS As the country grapples with the coronavirus and nationwide protests, seven states and D.C. are holding presidential primaries on Tuesday with 479 delegates up for grabs, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee, but he is still 460 delegates away from clinching the nomination, according to the current CBS News delegate estimate. Vote tallies will start coming in Tuesday evening, but final results may require a few days or longer given that many states are using vote-by-mail and some counties have already warned it will take a couple of days to count ballots. Biden picked up early wins in Indiana, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, CBS News projected. The early results give him at least 129 more delegates, putting him at 1,683 delegates total out of the 1,991 needed to officially clinch the Democratic nomination. The states holding presidential primaries Tuesday night are Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Dakota. MONEY MATTERS PAC ATTACK The Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA is out with a new television ad today that features video from Mr. Trump's remarks Monday from the Rose Garden as protesters were violently cleared from the park outside the White House, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The minute-long ad titled ""Antithetical"" will run as part of a seven-figure weekly ad buy in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In it, Mr. Trump claims to be a president of ""law and order"" and an ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but the video shows people with their hands up being tear gassed and shoved by law enforcement officers in full tactical gear. It also uses clips from interviews of both retired lieutenant general Russel Honoré and Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington slamming the President and his use of St. John's Church for a photo-op. Priorities USA plans to spend $200 million by the end of the year. At the same time, the anti-Trump PAC The Lincoln Project just started airing its latest ad taking aim at the president, titled ""Treason,"" which focuses on the confederate flag appearing at past Trump events, as well as uses the President's comments on the Charlottesville rally in 2017. According to data from Kantar/CMAG, the ad first aired Tuesday morning in the battleground state of North Carolina. In the past two days, The Lincoln Project has spent more than $500,000 on ad buys in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and DC. STATE-BY-STATE NEVADA The Republican National Committee and Nevada's Republican party have sued a Nevada county for public records they say could shed light on deliberation over changes to the county's upcoming all-mail primary. The decision by Clark County, Nevada's largest by population, to send mail ballots to all registered voters had been trumpeted last month by Democrats as a victory. But Republicans have decried the move as a ""shady backroom deal,"" prompting the GOP to send a letter to Nevada's attorney general in late May demanding an investigation over a ""potential Nevada open public meeting violation and election irregularities."" In an email to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, county spokesperson Dan Kulin said, ""This lawsuit is based upon suspicions not facts and we expect to prevail."" Democrats late Monday also dismissed news of the lawsuit as ""just more of the same from Trump and Republicans,"" denouncing the court filing as ""continuing their campaign of disinformation to undermine the integrity of the election process."" PENNSYLVANIA Pennsylvania's primary election on Tuesday is offering a glimpse into the preferences of Democrats and Republicans for voting during a pandemic, reports CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Nearly 20 times as many voters as in the 2016 primary in the state have applied for mail-in voting, allowed without an excuse for the first time in the state. The battleground state has about 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, and Democrats have vastly outnumbered Republicans for mail-in ballot requests, according to Pennsylvania State Department data. Nearly a third of registered Democrats have applied to vote-by-mail, but only about 16% of Republicans have. As the deadline to vote by mail approached in the state, elections lawyers and county officials warned that many residents who applied to vote by mail would receive their ballots with too little time to get them back to elections offices by June 2. Governor Tom Wolf on Monday issued an executive order delaying the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive by a week in six counties, including the populous Philadelphia and Allegheny counties. The Department of State has approved polling place cuts of up to 60% across Pennsylvania, but by nearly 90 percent in the Allegheny County. At the Fulton Elementary School in Pittsburgh's 11th Ward, a line snaked down the street by late afternoon, with voters reporting waiting up to 45 minutes. Some voters there had applied to vote by mail, but never received a ballot. Faith Cotter, a Democrat from East Liberty, said she and her fiancé applied for mail-in ballots in mid-April, long before the May 26 deadline, but never received them. ""I have asthma, so I've been staying inside except going for jogs and stuff like that,"" she said. ""I didn't plan to be here in person. "" CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE While Congressman Steve King's race is the biggest storyline in Tuesday's House primaries, a Republican primary in nearby Indiana was also one to watch, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Since Congresswoman Susan Brooks announced this would be her last term serving Indiana's 5th district, 15 Republicans have filed for the open seat. Brooks currently serves as a recruitment chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee, and her retirement came amidst a record low amount of Republican women serving in the House. Her potential successors included Treasurer Kelly Mitchell and newcomer Beth Henderson, though State Senator Victoria Spartz ended up winning the nomination on Tuesday night. Former State Representative Christina Hale has locked up the nomination for Democrats, who have put this central Indiana seat on their target list. Another open seat race is in Indiana's 1st district, currently represented by Democrat Peter Visclosky. Fourteen Democrats and six Republicans filed for this district which encompasses parts of the Chicago southwest suburbs and Gary, Indiana. In New York, long-ime Congressman and current House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel was caught on a hot mic during a local press conference about Monday's protests in the Bronx. Engel is heard asking Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. for a speaking slot, and after being told that there's too many people already on the list, Engel said twice, ""If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care."" In response, Diaz Jr. said, ""Don't do that to me. We're not going to do this."" Engel is facing a competitive primary against progressive Jamaal Bowman, who was recently endorsed by two other Democratic challengers. ""This is so incredibly painful to watch from @RepEliotEngel. It hurts,"" Bowman Tweeted. ""We need to be taking care of our communities right now – whether it's election season or not. It's clear that we need new leadership in #NY16."" IN THE SENATE Republican senators were asked by reporters in the halls of the Capitol about Mr. Trump's visit to St. John's on Monday night. Many senators ignored the question or said they had not seen the footage, but CBS News Capitol Hill producer Alan He reports Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine strongly criticized the president's photo-op. ""All of us are upset at the fire that was set at the church, a historic house of worship for many, many presidents,"" Collins said, ""But I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peacefully protest."" Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also said ""I did not think that what we saw last night was the America that I know."" In a press conference after the Senate GOP's weekly lunch, CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson reports Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters about the events that sparked the protests, ""I think we all agree egregious wrongs have been done, much of it recorded,"" and added, ""peaceful protest is what we need and there is much work still to be done in America with regard to race relations."" GOVERNOR'S MANSION MONTANA The Democratic gubernatorial primary between businesswoman Whitney Williams and Lieutenant Governor Mike Cooney is the biggest unknown out of Tuesday's primaries in Montana. Cooney has served alongside Governor Steve Bullock since 2016 and has been endorsed by Senator Jon Tester and Bullock, who has enjoyed relatively high approval ratings in the state. Cooney is also an established figure in Montana politics, as he began serving in the state legislature in 1976. But Williams slightly leads in fundraising, and has received some outside help and investment from groups like EMILY's List. In place of the usual preelection rallies, Williams has been holding ""Get Out The Vote"" rallies over Zoom. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports her ""Big Sky Bright Future"" rally on Monday featured actor Ben Affleck (a part-time resident of the state) and NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo, who said he'd visit the state a couple times to do some social work as a member of the Atlanta Hawks. ""Montana is not a new place to me... I know that state very well. I know we're here for Whitney, but for me, I'm here for a special friend,"" he said in his pitch of Williams to voters, adding that he's traveled with her in Africa for philanthropic work. ""She's had a passion in helping people...to make sure the future of our society is really protected."" On the Republican side awaits either Montana's at-large Congressman Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Tim Fox or state Senator Al Olszewski. Gianforte previously ran as the state's Republican candidate in 2016, and is poised to clinch the nomination again this cycle due to outpacing his opponents in fundraising (and personal loans). One other thing to watch for in Montana today is how their change to sending absentee ballots to registered voters will go, something the state has not done before.",0.0

Mr. Trump promised that ""American carnage stops right here"" at his inauguration three years ago. Law enforcement officials in front of the White House on Monday sprayed tear gas and used flash bangs to clear people protesting the death of George Floyd as the president prepared to speak from the Rose Garden. The demonstration was described as peaceful. ""It seems as if the president considers the exercise of one's First Amendment rights to be carnage,"" Clyburn said Tuesday on CBSN's ""Red & Blue"" program. ""How we define it, generally, he has contributed to it more than any president in my lifetime. I don't think any president since maybe Woodrow Wilson."" Rep. Jim Clyburn: Trump has contributed to American carnage Clyburn, the Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, called Minnesota's decision to open a civil rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department a ""very significant"" step, and one that people ""ought to feel pretty good about."" ""We have to begin to take action here. We can't allow these things to continue to happen,"" he said. Clyburn noted that only one Minneapolis police officer has ever been convicted for murder, and that happened to be a black police officer. Clyburn was referencing former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who was found guilty of murdering Justine Damond three years ago. Damond, a white woman, was unarmed when she was shot and killed by Noor, who was responding to a possible sexual assault she had called in. ""There's something very interesting going on in Minneapolis that all of us need to take a harder look at,"" Clyburn said. ""... Something is just not right, I feel it in my gut."" Asked what he would say to younger Americans who are outraged by continued incidents like Mr. Floyd's death and feel that the system has failed them — and the generations that came before them — Clyburn said: ""In this country, the pendulum goes back and forth. Our society goes back and forth, just like the pendulum on the clock."" ""I went to jail trying to change the laws. We went to jail wondering whether or not we were doing the right thing. We changed those laws. We did the right thing, and many people are benefiting from it today,"" Clyburn said. ""When I went to jail back then I think there were two or three African Americans in the United States Congress, today there are 55. That's a change."" ""We need to keep pressing. We are in the pursuit of a more perfect union,"" he said. ""This is not a perfect country, it is a good country — it's even a great country. We've got to make this country's greatness accessible and affordable for all of its citizens. And you don't do that by criticizing, or by standing on the sidelines, or by throwing bricks, or by burning down buildings. You do that by building upon those sacrifices that our parents made.""",0.0

PAUL -- The Twin Cities witnessed 87 fires in five days during the heat of recent unrest, officials said Tuesday in announcing a new task force to track down arsonists believed to be responsible for a large portion of them. “Eighty-seven’s an enormous number,” Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said at an afternoon news conference, citing figures from the state fire marshal’s office. Under normal circumstances, that period might see one or two fires, he said. Fires have blazed across St. Paul and Minneapolis over the past week as rioting, arson and looting punctuated mass protests over last week’s death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. Harrington said the task force consists of personnel from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, St. Paul and Minneapolis fire departments, arson investigators from the two cities’ police departments, and the state fire marshal’s office. “Today they are starting to work that list of fires to find where are commonalities, where are the common criminal threads, and they are also going out to collect those incendiary devices — those bottles of gasoline that we’ve been hearing stories about but, frankly, had not physically gotten our hands on,” he said. “So now we have folks out there picking those up. … We know that so many of those fires were deliberately set.” Harrington said tracking down the arsonists isn’t just a matter of investigating a statutory crime, but part of the broader issue of seeking justice in the aftermath of the riots. “It was not just stuff,” Harrington said, noting that many of the fires have left small-business owners with little prospects for rebuilding, workers without jobs, and communities without access to food, medicine and other goods and services.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And now let's go to London's Hyde Park, where thousands of people today have turned out for a rally in solidarity with the protests in America. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Say his name. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: George Floyd. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Say his name. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: George Floyd. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Say his name. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: George Floyd. INSKEEP: They're saying his name in London. NPR's Frank Langfitt has been with the protesters. And Frank, why has George Floyd's death resonated with people where you are? FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Yeah, it's been really striking, Steve, as to how much it's resonated. People say that they experience a lot of racist incidents here as well. There's a woman named Belly Mujinga who was spat on. She, I believe, was a ticket taker on London transport. She got COVID-19 and died. And people were, of course, very angry about that. I was also talking to a guy named Gary Gordon (ph) here who, you know, described, years ago, being stopped by police and only being allowed to leave, basically what he felt it was under false pretenses and only getting out because he actually happened to work for the BBC, so they let him go. So a lot of this - the kind of racism and casual racism that you hear in the United States, you hear from people here. They've been experiencing this for many years, so they connect to it. INSKEEP: We're talking with Frank Langfitt. He's in London's Hyde Park, and we can hear the helicopter overhead as you are talking, Frank. Because you mentioned COVID-19, because Eleanor mentioned COVID-19, I'd like to know if this is in any way a socially distant crowd. LANGFITT: It's not. They tried in the beginning. It was fascinating, Steve. I got here, and it was almost like ushers at a movie theater. And they were saying, here take your - they tried very hard. You know, here are some masks. Here are some gloves, and you can go sit down in a certain place. But then once it got going, everybody stood up, and they all rushed to the center to listen to people protest and chant and tell stories. And so no, it is not socially distanced. What's really interesting is that Black Lives Matter UK, which is the umbrella group, is actually not a part of this march. It's being run by Black Lives Matter London because, frankly, blacks of African descent have been hit the hardest by COVID-19 here. And the idea of a lot of people coming out here and doing a non-socially distanced event, people are worried that it's just going to spread the disease. So absolutely an issue and very little social distancing, Steve. INSKEEP: And yet in spite of all those concerns, thousands of people are present, right? LANGFITT: Yeah. I mean, right now it's got to be - it looks like easily 10,000 to me right here on the lawn. INSKEEP: And this is one of many protests across Europe in the last few days, right? LANGFITT: It is. We've had them in Amsterdam, Copenhagen. And we're going to have at least two more in London in the next few days. INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Frank Langfitt in Hyde Park in London. Frank, thanks so much. LANGFITT: You're very welcome, Steve. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Joe Biden won the Democratic presidential primary in South Dakota. Representative Dusty Johnson defeated Liz Marty May to represent South Dakota’s at-large congressional district. Republican Senator Mike Rounds defeated challenger Scyller Borglum. Authorities have arrested two men in connection with the violence in Sioux Falls Sunday night. Devonte Curtis, 25, of Omaha, Nebraska, is accused of trying to start a fire in trash cans between gas pumps at a Sioux Falls convenience store.

There are currently five inmates at the Minnehaha County jail with COVID-19. Eight staff members have also tested positive. Dealing with the virus in the tight quarters of the jail has proven to be a challenge. Extra sanitizing by staff has also lead to inmates being confined to their cells longer than usual. The food giveaway that was set up by several organizations to help families impacted by the coronavirus pandemic has moved to a new spot. The giveaway is now at the old Fareway store at 41st and Grange in Sioux Falls. Organizers say they had to move because the W.H. Lyon Fairgrounds needed the space for the summer. Several businesses were impacted and had to close their doors after three tornadoes hit Sioux Falls in September. Now nearly nine months later, one of those businesses is reopening.

Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. ""As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,"" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation's capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing.

The AP's review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with ""the very worst days of the pandemic so far"" in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,"" he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 9,300 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren't necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. ""I'm actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,"" he said. Eisenman called protesting an ""essential activity,"" possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. ""There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,"" she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It's a concern for her now, too. ""You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,"" she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can't definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago, and other experts noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. ""Racism kills,"" Hershow said. ""Sometimes that's direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it's through a virus like COVID-19.""",0.0

Floyd's death has reawakened fury over the 2016 death of 24-year-old Adama Traore in police custody. But the scenes in Paris did mirror the U.S. in many ways — including the fact that some of the demonstrations erupted in violence.
