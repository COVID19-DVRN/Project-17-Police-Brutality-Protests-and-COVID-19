Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

The American South roundup includes stories and galleries from USA TODAY Network news organizations across our Southern states. This week we continue sharing top news stories from across the South. In Memphis, Tenn. a silent 'Black Lives Matter' demonstration to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery led to verbal confrontations with city police and counter protestors. As restrictions are starting to ease around the country, many businesses, including the film industry in the 'Hollywood of the South' are considering timelines to reopen. Across Tennessee, religious leaders are contemplating timelines too, as many have to decide when to resume in-person worship. Meanwhile in Mississippi, amusement parks and water parks are open, as many believe they are safe from coronavirus infection with social distancing in place and staff wearing masks. Finally, while reopening gives some hope for a rebounded economy, business leaders in tourist-driven cities like Asheville, N.C. aren't all certain. Memphis police closed a section of Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis Wednesday night after a demonstration turned confrontational. The protest was sparked after Floyd's death this week became the latest in a string of violence against black people. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for an extended period. Restrictions are starting to ease around the country, but many businesses are slow to start back up again, the film industry included. But in Georgia, a place many consider the Hollywood of the South, actor, director and producer Tyler Perry plans to hit the ground running as soon as July even as many other studios in the state are waiting to see what happens in California. As the state opens religious leaders are deciding when to bring congregations together for in-person services and how to mitigate exposure when they do.Bishop J. Mark Spalding, who leads the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nashville began open services in mid-May but encouraged parishioners with chronic illnesses to stay home. Other religious leaders have taken a different approach, and will be online-only for now. As water parks and amusement parks reopen in Mississippi, visitors expressed excitement that there is a place to welcome more outdoor activity. Many described feeling safe from coronovirus with staff and patrons practicing appropriate social distancing in lines and others wearing masks as an additional measure of safety. A near-total shutdown devastated tourism in the Asheville area, and it could take years to fully return. Some who are forecasting an outcome point to low hotel occupancy and flight restrictions. Others find hope that the mountain region of North Carolina might see a quicker return, in part because it’s a “drive market” that people can get to with a car.

The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into Thursday morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, Floyd pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a mostly peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued Thursday. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Firefighters were still spraying water onto hot buildings Thursday morning, and some buildings still smoldered, sending a bitter smell into the smoke-filled air. Windows were smashed out of several businesses in a strip mall, including a department store, a charter school and other businesses, and the destruction was visible for blocks. A Wendy’s restaurant was damaged beyond recognition. Inside some of the stores, shelves were toppled and debris strewn about. Video taken inside a damaged Target that had been looted showed empty clothing racks. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. Streets and parking lots were also covered in debris, and many businesses had been spray-painted. There was no sign of a police presence, except around the precinct building, where officers were in riot gear. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Demonstrators also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd’s death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited.",0.0

(Chris Juhn/Zenger) Masked vandals smashed windows, slashed police car tires and threw bricks in a standoff that lasted until 5:00 a.m. The Minneapolis Police Department fired four police officers who arrested Floyd. The 46-year-old died after an officer pinned him down by the neck with one knee. George Floyd died Monday after his arrest outside Cup Foods, a Minneapolis restaurant that reported a customer who paid for a meal with a counterfeit $20 bill. Widely circulated videos of the incident show a handcuffed Floyd on the ground with a white officer’s knee on the back of his neck, his pleas for help ignored. “I can’t breathe,” Floyd told the officer. The 46-year-old man died later at the Hennepin County Medical Center. Thousands of protesters descended on a police precinct a day later. Some spray-painted patrol cars, slashed tires and broke windows. Police responded with tear gas canisters after the crowd broke through the gate that protected more vehicles. The standoff lasted until 5:00 a.m., with demonstrators hurling bricks and other objects at police. Protesters had walked more than 2 miles from Cup Foods, organized by activists who would later try to keep the march peaceful. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired Officer Derek Chauvin and three other officers who were present. “Being black in America should not be a death sentence. This officer failed in the most basic human sense,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a press conference. “Four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated. This is the right call,” Frey tweeted. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a community organizer, first called for a protest on Facebook. “Friends, Please wear your masks and join us if you can in demanding justice for the Black man who was unjustly killed by Minneapolis Police yesterday in broad daylight,” she wrote. “We can’t escape police violence even in a global pandemic.” Share this: Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google  Like this: Like Loading...",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

1619952745,2020-05-29 02:59:49,Trump promises action over the growing Mpls. protests,https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-protests-grow-after-gov-walz-calls-up-guard/570830002/,en,False,,316913,mississippi.statenews.net,http://mississippi.statenews.net/,"The Twin Cities convulsed with chaos for a third straight night of violent unrest Thursday in the wake of the Memorial Day death of George Floyd as he was being restrained on the neck by a Minneapolis police officer. Late Thursday and early Friday, rioters invaded and set fire to Minneapolis police’s Third Precinct headquarters and for a second overnight, torched and looted many other buildings in the Lake Street corridor, many of them housing small businesses with minority owners. The unrest got the attention of President Donald Trump, who tweeted he “can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis.” Trump added that he had talked to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz “and told him that the military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” About 1:30 a.m. Friday, Mayor Jacob Frey, who previously had held news conferences to denounce Floyd’s death and call for the arrest of the officers involved, held one to address the chaos of the past three days. “Earlier this evening, after receiving real-time information from [Police Chief Medaria] Arradondo and after having numerous phone calls with him involving the situation at the Third Precinct, it became clear that there were imminent threats to both officers and the public,” Frey said. “I made the decision to evacuate the Third Precinct. The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public. Brick and mortar is not as important as life.” Though acknowledging protesters’ “pain and anger,” he said, “What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights is unacceptable. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food. They are essential to our community.” Frey said it became clear by Wednesday that Minneapolis police needed help, and that help came from the State Patrol and the National Guard callup. He reiterated his support for calls made by Arradondo and the Minneapolis Fire Department on responses to the violence and fires. Frey repeated his passionate calls for help from the community: “We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now.” Asked about Trump’s tweets, which also criticized him, Frey said, “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your fingers at somebody else at a time of crisis. Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis.” Some of the 500 National Guard troops deployed earlier in the day by Walz to assist police and the State Patrol — the first deployment for a civil disturbance in 34 years — went to the Third Precinct to try to make it safe for firefighters, but just after midnight, little firefighting was able to take place, with rioters remaining in the area, throwing projectiles and according to one witness, shooting bullets into the building. The city of Minneapolis tweeted a warning to stay away from the area around Hiawatha Avenue and Lake Street: “We’re hearing unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the Third Precinct have been cut and other explosive materials are in the building. If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes. In the space of a few minutes late Thursday, priority 1 calls related to the unrest poured in to Minneapolis police: A gunshot victim walked into HCMC. Squads were dispatched to break up fights between looters and business owners near N. 42nd and Lyndale avenues. About 2 a.m. Friday, police scanner traffic indicated that protesters were headed toward the Fourth Precinct headquarters, in north Minneapolis. Armed vehicles bearing Guard troops were also reportedly arriving in downtown Minneapolis. Across the Mississippi River in St. Paul, looting, fire and vandals had damaged about 170 buildings by night’s end, police said. One man was spotted smashing a boulder into an ATM at Big Top Liquors on W. University Avenue. And around 1:35 p.m., about a block from Minnesota United’s Allianz Field, Deryck Miller of St. Paul witnessed a shooting. “A gentleman pulled out a gun and started shooting in this direction, and a person got out of that black car and ran away,” said Miller, who was helping a friend who owns an automotive shop in the Midway neighborhood. “It’s just been crazy out here.” Miller estimated that 90% of nearby businesses had been looted. By evening, a nearby NAPA Auto Parts store had been set on fire. Metro Transit suspended all bus and light-rail service through the weekend. Target ordered 24 area stores to close until further notice. The worst-struck parts of the Twin Cities had the feel of a cat-and-mouse game. When a police vehicle pulled up to a strip mall in St. Paul’s Midway neighborhood, where a large crowd had smashed windows of a Verizon store, a Noodles & Co. and a Vitamin Shoppe, the crowd immediately scattered, only to re-emerge elsewhere. Police formed a barricade in front of a Target there. But no officers were at the T.J. Maxx store a block away, so looters smashed the door down and fled with shoes and clothing piled on shopping carts. Calls for patience unheeded Earlier Thursday, county and federal prosecutors expressed disgust at Floyd’s killing while pleading for the public’s patience as they conduct an investigation and mull whether to charge Derek Chauvin, the police officer whose knee was pressed to Floyd’s neck as he died, or the other three officers present. The Hennepin County medical examiner mirrored that call for patience, saying an autopsy to determine a cause and manner for Floyd’s death cannot be rushed — even as protesters demanded that Chauvin swiftly be charged with murder. “I will not rush justice,” said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. “We have to do this right. We have to prove this in a court of law. … Please: Give me and give the United States attorney the time to do this right, and we will bring you justice — I promise.” All day, Thursday felt like a continued push and pull between city and state authorities pleading for calm and protesters fed up with the systemic racism they believe Floyd’s killing represents. There were also glimmers of hope Thursday. Scores of community members showed up in the Lake Street Target parking lot for a massive cleanup. Forces of restoration took over the spot where rioters had encamped hours before. National civil rights leaders appeared at protests: Jesse Jackson sported a sign saying, “Cowards kill the unarmed,” while Al Sharpton met with local leaders and protesters. Artists painted a mural of Floyd’s smiling face outside the Cup Foods grocery store on Chicago Avenue where he was killed. At a late-morning news conference, Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins strode up to a podium, removed her face mask and sang part of “Amazing Grace,” echoing former President Barack Obama singing the hymn after the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, S.C. “We feel,” she said, referring to the black community in Minneapolis and nationwide, “as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks — a knee that says, ‘Black life does not matter to the institutions that dictate what happens in this culture and society.’ … Until we name this virus, this disease that has infected America for the past 400 years, we will never, ever resolve this issue.” 911 call transcript released On Thursday, officials released the transcript of the 911 calls linked to Floyd’s death. A 911 operator received the call at 8:01 p.m. Monday from a clerk at Cup Foods about a man, later suspected to be Floyd, who had bought cigarettes with fake money. The caller reported that the man was outside in his car and “is awfully drunk, and he’s not in control of himself.” After obtaining a physical description of the man and a vehicle associated with him, the operator said, “All right, I’ve got help on the way. If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we’ll have squads out there shortly, OK?” “No problem,” the caller replied. Police arrived and detained a handcuffed Floyd on the pavement as he begged to be allowed to breathe. Medics arrived and took Floyd to HCMC. He was unresponsive and lacking a pulse when he arrived.

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

PETAL — Protesters gathered Friday at Petal City Hall to demand the resignation of Mayor Hal Marx for making comments they believe are racist regarding the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, who died after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer on Monday. At least 200 people attended the Petal rally, most wearing masks amid calls of keeping six feet apart for social distancing. Petal, Miss. resident Lorraine Bates walks three miles to Petal City Hall with chains around her feet to protest Petal Mayor Hal Marx's refusal to resign amid controversy regarding comments he made on Facebook and Twitter about the death of George Floyd. Friday, May 29, 2020. (Photo: Cam Bonelli/Hattiesburg American) There was a brief fight at the rally after one protester interrupted a speaker, but it was quelled quickly as police stepped in and organizers asked people to stop. “Don’t do it. That’s what they want,” people in the crowd shouted. Lorraine Bates, an older Petal woman who walked three miles to city hall for the protest with chains around her feet, grabbed the microphone and started singing a gospel song, which lowered the heated mood. No one was arrested. Prior to the incident, the Rev. Christopher Preston with the Mississippi Rising Coalition said it is time for Marx to step down. Who is Hal Marx?: Mississippi mayor under fire over George Floyd social media comments “Mayor Marx’s comments were hurtful to a lot of people,” he said. Preston, of Collins, called for people to redirect that pain back to Marx. “We’re not here to change his mind, we’re here to change his action,” he said. Cody Chandler of Richton, who grew up in Petal, said Marx’s actions are “all messed up.” “I think we all need to get along,” he said. “There’s going to be a civil war or something. It’s going to be 1861 all over again.” (Story continues after photo gallery.) Signs of “Black lives matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “Fight for a better South” dotted the crowd. Protesters stood peacefully In small groups, some close to city hall’s front door, others standing further away. They continued to trickle in as the rally progressed with motivational speakers leading cheers. On the same day as the protest, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before Floyd died. 'He doesn't know the struggles that black lives go through' Nineteen-year-old Celeste Garden-May of Petal said she took Marx's comments personally. ""I thought if he really thought like that, he could have just kept it to himself because he doesn't know the hard struggles that black lives go through,"" she said. She said while all lives matter, now is a critical time for blacks since more are dying through violence than ever before. ""During this point in time, black lives are being taken more than any other race in this country and it needs to stop."" Related: Here's why a mayor can't be ousted for tweet about George Floyd's death Former Petal resident Sasha Lewis, a 17-year-old from Hattiesburg, said she was offended by Marx said the police were being crucified, when video of Floyd's last minutes show he was the one whose life was in jeopardy. ""He also said he wanted to keep everyone neutral, when in fact he wasn't being neutral by choosing the side of injustice,"" she said. ""He hasn't apologized. He doesn't feel any remorse. He just feels that people should have understood him better and that's not enough."" Cayla Camp, a Petal native, said she attended the Board of Aldermen meeting Thursday night, going with an open mind, as Marx had asked, but after the meeting she made up her mind to attend the protest. She said she was disappointed Marx didn't take the initiative to resign ahead of the protests, which would hopefully reduce the possibility of the protest erupting in violence. ""He had no remorse, he did not apologize,"" Camp said. ""He just did not seem to respect the words and the opinions of the city. It was very clear that the majority wanted him to step down."" Comments on Minnesota man's death spark outrage Marx came under fire earlier this week after posting on Twitter and Facebook, ""If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" referencing Floyd's death and the police officer's actions. The tweet and his account have since been deleted. The comments prompted a storm on social media, including the mayor and his family receiving threats of violence and even death, he said. Story continues after photo gallery. Got to go: Petal aldermen, residents call for mayor's resignation. He refuses. An employee with the Jones County Sheriff’s Department was fired after making a comment on Facebook about Floyd’s death Thursday night. “We do not in any way condone or agree with the post,” the department wrote on Facebook. “The individual who made the post is no longer employed by our agency. We apologize for the hurt caused by this individual's action which we had no advance notice of or control over.” Marx denies his comments were racist, saying he was only asking people to wait for more information before blaming police for Floyd's death. ""I think that people are so quick to judge the police before they have all the facts,"" he said in an earlier story. ""I can't say whether a crime was committed or whether they did anything right or wrong, all I'm saying is don't rush to judgment based on what you see in that video."" Wrong idea: Petal mayor says comments on George Floyd death in police incident misinterpreted On Thursday, the Board of Aldermen voted unanimously at a special meeting to ask for Marx's resignation, but the mayor refused, saying everyone seeking his removal from office are bullies and he needs to stand up to them. Residents and others were there also demanding the mayor resign. Marx, who was first voted into office in 2009, was reelected twice. His current term expires June 30, 2021. He has said previously he will not seek a fourth term. In May 2018, Marx announced he was running for governor in the 2019 race, but pulled out of the race in January 2019 after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. (Story continues after photo gallery.) Protest in Jackson About 20 people gathered on the steps on the Mississippi Capitol Friday afternoon to call for justice for Floyd. Protesters chanted, sang ""We Shall Overcome,"" and held up signs. One read ""Let them breathe."" Another said, ""Jail killer cops."" As the protesters took to the streets, two TV reporters captured video of a van making contact with a protester walking in the middle lane, nearly running them over before speeding away.

Still, Reeves called for the protests to be peaceful and for protesters to wear masks and practice social distancing during any demonstration.

PETAL — Protesters gathered Friday at Petal City Hall to demand the resignation of Mayor Hal Marx for making comments they believe are racist regarding the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, who died after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer on Monday.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Residents also protest, want him out. Mississippi Clarion Ledger This story will be updated. PETAL — Protesters gathered Friday at Petal City Hall to demand the resignation of Mayor Hal Marx for making comments they believe are racist regarding the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, who died after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer on Monday. At least 200 people attended the Petal rally, most wearing masks amid calls of keeping six feet apart for social distancing. Petal, Miss. resident Lorraine Bates walks three miles to Petal City Hall with chains around her feet to protest Petal Mayor Hal Marx's refusal to resign amid controversy regarding comments he made on Facebook and Twitter about the death of George Floyd. Friday, May 29, 2020. (Photo: Cam Bonelli/Hattiesburg American) There was a brief fight at the rally after one protester interrupted a speaker, but it was quelled quickly as police stepped in and organizers asked people to stop. “Don’t do it. That’s what they want,” people in the crowd shouted. Lorraine Bates, an older Petal woman who walked three miles to city hall for the protest with chains around her feet, grabbed the microphone and started singing a gospel song, which lowered the heated mood. No one was arrested. Prior to the incident, the Rev. Christopher Preston with the Mississippi Rising Coalition said it is time for Marx to step down. Who is Hal Marx?: Mississippi mayor under fire over George Floyd social media comments “Mayor Marx’s comments were hurtful to a lot of people,” he said. Preston, of Collins, called for people to redirect that pain back to Marx. “We’re not here to change his mind, we’re here to change his action,” he said. Cody Chandler of Richton, who grew up in Petal, said Marx’s actions are “all messed up.” “I think we all need to get along,” he said. “There’s going to be a civil war or something. It’s going to be 1861 all over again.” (Story continues after photo gallery.) Signs of “Black lives matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “Fight for a better South” dotted the crowd. Protesters stood peacefully In small groups, some close to city hall’s front door, others standing further away. They continued to trickle in as the rally progressed with motivational speakers leading cheers. On the same day as the protest, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before Floyd died. 'He doesn't know the struggles that black lives go through' Nineteen-year-old Celeste Garden-May of Petal said she took Marx's comments personally. ""I thought if he really thought like that, he could have just kept it to himself because he doesn't know the hard struggles that black lives go through,"" she said. She said while all lives matter, now is a critical time for blacks since more are dying through violence than ever before. ""During this point in time, black lives are being taken more than any other race in this country and it needs to stop."" Related: Here's why a mayor can't be ousted for tweet about George Floyd's death Former Petal resident Sasha Lewis, a 17-year-old from Hattiesburg, said she was offended by Marx said the police were being crucified, when video of Floyd's last minutes show he was the one whose life was in jeopardy. ""He also said he wanted to keep everyone neutral, when in fact he wasn't being neutral by choosing the side of injustice,"" she said. ""He hasn't apologized. He doesn't feel any remorse. He just feels that people should have understood him better and that's not enough."" Cayla Camp, a Petal native, said she attended the Board of Aldermen meeting Thursday night, going with an open mind, as Marx had asked, but after the meeting she made up her mind to attend the protest. She said she was disappointed Marx didn't take the initiative to resign ahead of the protests, which would hopefully reduce the possibility of the protest erupting in violence. ""He had no remorse, he did not apologize,"" Camp said. ""He just did not seem to respect the words and the opinions of the city. It was very clear that the majority wanted him to step down."" Comments on Minnesota man's death spark outrage Marx came under fire earlier this week after posting on Twitter and Facebook, ""If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" referencing Floyd's death and the police officer's actions. The tweet and his account have since been deleted. The comments prompted a storm on social media, including the mayor and his family receiving threats of violence and even death, he said. Story continues after photo gallery. Got to go: Petal aldermen, residents call for mayor's resignation. He refuses. An employee with the Jones County Sheriff’s Department was fired after making a comment on Facebook about Floyd’s death Thursday night. “We do not in any way condone or agree with the post,” the department wrote on Facebook. “The individual who made the post is no longer employed by our agency. We apologize for the hurt caused by this individual's action which we had no advance notice of or control over.” Marx denies his comments were racist, saying he was only asking people to wait for more information before blaming police for Floyd's death. ""I think that people are so quick to judge the police before they have all the facts,"" he said in an earlier story. ""I can't say whether a crime was committed or whether they did anything right or wrong, all I'm saying is don't rush to judgment based on what you see in that video."" Wrong idea: Petal mayor says comments on George Floyd death in police incident misinterpreted On Thursday, the Board of Aldermen voted unanimously at a special meeting to ask for Marx's resignation, but the mayor refused, saying everyone seeking his removal from office are bullies and he needs to stand up to them. Residents and others were there also demanding the mayor resign. Marx, who was first voted into office in 2009, was reelected twice. His current term expires June 30, 2021. He has said previously he will not seek a fourth term. In May 2018, Marx announced he was running for governor in the 2019 race, but pulled out of the race in January 2019 after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. (Story continues after photo gallery.) Protest in Jackson About 20 people gathered on the steps on the Mississippi Capitol Friday afternoon to call for justice for Floyd. Protesters chanted, sang ""We Shall Overcome,"" and held up signs. One read ""Let them breathe."" Another said, ""Jail killer cops."" As the protesters took to the streets, two TV reporters captured video of a van making contact with a protester walking in the middle lane, nearly running them over before speeding away.

Tate Reeves said protesting against the government is a constitutional right that is foundational to American society. “I fully support everyone’s individual right to protest their government,” Reeves said. Still, Reeves called for the protests to be peaceful and for protesters to wear masks and practice social distancing during any demonstration.

1620402125,2020-05-29 15:35:56,Crowds assemble for weekend protests against mayor Marx,https://www.hubcityspokes.com/news-petal/crowds-assemble-weekend-protests-against-mayor-marx,en,False,,661661,Hub City Spokes,http://www.hubcityspokes.com/,"Friday marked the first day of a three-day protest of citizens demanding Petal Mayor Hal Marx resign over social media comments he made regarding a fatal encounter between Minneapolis police and a black man named George Floyd. Approximately 100 people had gathered in front of Petal City Hall by 12:30 p.m. Friday to protest Marx, who said during a special-called meeting the night before that he would not resign and has every intention of filling out the remainder of his term. A few guest speakers talked about Marx and the Minneapolis incident – in which Floyd died after a police officer applied pressure with his knee to Floyd’s neck while Floyd said he couldn’t breathe – while the crowd listened and brandished signs. “I think Mr. Marx’s remarks are deplorable, and I think as a mayor, he is there to represent all people, and he did not do that with those remarks,” Hattiesburg resident Leslie Smith said. “And so it’s a bad representation for Petal, and it’s a bad representation for Mississippi. So I think he should resign.” On March 26, Marx posted on Facebook, “If you can talk you can breathe. Think about that before you rush to judgment. #thinblueline.” Marx also said on Twitter that no one knew, for example, if Floyd had died of a heart attack or drug overdose, as all the facts of the case are not yet available. The protests will continue over the weekend, with attendees gathering Saturday and Sunday in front of city hall. “I’m kind of disappointed that stuff like that is still going on these days; it shouldn’t be like that,” Sumrall resident Manuela Acosta said. “There’s a lot of injustice. I’m from Europe, and it just baffles me that stuff like that is still going on. It’s just very sad.” Marx said previously that his comments were not meant to be racist, but instead in support of police officers. ""My point in what I said in those social media comments ... was that I've always been a big supporter of the police,"" Marx said at the previous day’s meeting. ""I didn't think through what I said, as far as including some sympathy for Mr. Floyd and his family. ""What I said came out in a way I wish I had said differently. It wasn't to minimize that gentleman's death; it was simply an impulsive statement saying that people will wait for all the answers to get out before we (act).""",0.0

The charge comes in the wake of three days of riotous protest that exploded across the nation. The murder, which took place on Memorial Day May 25th in Minneapolis, MN, was prompted by police response to a “forgery in progress” report. In a brutal arrest that has ignited the nation, officer Derik Chauvin was captured on video kneeling uncaringly into Floyd’s neck as he was downed on the pavement, muttering that he could not breathe. Once the police called an ambulance, Floyd died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Chauvin and three other officers were fired after the bystander footage of the murder emerged.  Hannepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Chauvin’s arrest in a press conference today. “The investigation is ongoing,” said Freeman, noting that other charges may be imminent. “Chauvin has eighteen prior complaints of improper police conduct, including violence,” said Guy Lewis, former U.S. Attorney to FOX News. “Just charging [and] arresting is only half the picture… the real goal here is to convict.” Across the nation, officials are faced with the response to protests and rioting. “We’re seeing two separate groups, said St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter to CBS News. “[There are] protestors… and folks who are out to use George Floyd’s killing… [to] further victimize the very communities who have already been traumatized…” “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city… What we have seen in terms of looting is unacceptable,” said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to CBS News. He noted the essential value of institutions like grocery stores, banks, and pharmacies to the community, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We additionally need help from our community,” saying that he has gotten state aid “to prevent looting.” People in every facet of American society have expressed their outrage about the situation, in no small part via social media. The President tweeted on the 28th, “…the Military is with [Governor Tim Walz] all the way… When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Although Floyd’s murderer is in custody, many are not satisfied, believing that the arrest should have come sooner, with the bystander’s egregious video evidence available to the public. Additionally, many protestors want a more severe murder charge, as well as charges against the other officers involved. Ultimately, as government officials seek to uphold the wellbeing of their constituents amid these turbulent times, justice-seekers across the nation await a murder conviction. It will be a meaningful instance to disturb a terribly consistent trend of white law enforcers going relatively unpunished for the killings of unarmed black people.

The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death.

In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy.

The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent.

EXCLUSIVE: Mississippi Mayor Hal Marx speaks out about protests, calls for resignation “It made me upset,” Lucas said. “I wish someone that is in such a high power would have more thoughtfulness for the people.” The protest was peaceful, even though attendees were encouraged to speak out on the injustice of Floyd’s death in police custody, but also to continue to seek Marx’s resignation. Most people were masked, but social distancing was nearly impossible with the crowd. A petition started on change.org calling for the mayor’s resignation has more than 13,000 signatures, more than the town's population of about 11,000. A protest rally and march was also held Friday at the state Capitol in Jackson, and on Saturday in Oxford.

1621063712,2020-05-30 14:08:11,Petal protest Day 2: Rally continues call for mayor's resignation,http://rssfeeds.clarionledger.com/~/625620432/0/jacksonms/news~Petal-protest-Day-Rally-continues-call-for-mayors-resignation/,en,False,,661654,Madison County Herald,http://www.mcherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/frontpage,"CLOSE Protesters gathered for a second day in front of Petal City Hall to call for Mayor Hal Marx's resignation in Petal, Miss., Saturday, May 30, 2020. Hattiesburg American At least 300 people attended the second day of a three-day rally in Mississippi protesting remarks made by Petal Mayor Hal Marx earlier in the week about the death of George Floyd. Carrie Lucas of Picayune said she came to the rally because she wanted to be part of moving Mississippi forward, and said Marx's comments were inappropriate. EXCLUSIVE: Mississippi Mayor Hal Marx speaks out about protests, calls for resignation “It made me upset,” Lucas said. “I wish someone that is in such a high power would have more thoughtfulness for the people.” The protest was peaceful, even though attendees were encouraged to speak out on the injustice of Floyd’s death in police custody, but also to continue to seek Marx’s resignation. Most people were masked, but social distancing was nearly impossible with the crowd. A petition started on change.org calling for the mayor’s resignation has more than 13,000 signatures, more than the town's population of about 11,000. A protest rally and march was also held Friday at the state Capitol in Jackson, and on Saturday in Oxford. Amid the Oxford protest on Saturday, a Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi campus was vandalized, with the words “spiritual genocide” painted on each side of the monument, along with red handprints, The Oxford Eagle reported. University police officers arrested one unidentified person at the scene Saturday evening, according to the newspaper. Floyd, a 46-year-old Minneapolis man, died Monday after a police officer held him to the ground with his knee for at least eight minutes. A bystander captured the incident on video. Melvin King of Hattiesburg asked protesters in Petal to boycott the mayor’s family businesses since the mayor refuses to step down. “You have the same mind,"" he told other protesters. ""You want to see right done. “I know that boycotting works. I don’t wish it on anybody, but until he steps down, you all need to stop going to his businesses."" Marx and his wife Mindy, however, said no one in their family owns a business. King said Marx’s words were not reflective of the city’s mindset. “We want him to reflect us and we want him to reflect us well,” King said. Marx came under fire earlier in the week after making comments on Facebook and Twitter about Floyd's death that some said were racist. In the posts, he said in part, ""If you can talk, you can breathe."" Signs saying ""I can't breathe,"" ""Stop killing black people"" and ""Make racists afraid again"" appeared at the protests. Story continues below gallery. Friday's rally in Petal: Protesters call for ouster of Petal mayor over George Floyd death comments One protester said he believed Marx's comment wasn't racist, but it was insensitive for the time and the mood of the people. ""I know people say things they ain't supposed to say,"" said Lindell Stokes of Wiggins, a Valdosta, Georgia, native. ""I understand what the mayor said. If he's talking, he's breathing. It's true. But if a man tells you he can breathe, they should have loosened up. That officer didn't loosen up and it resulted in this man's death."" ""I'm not going to say it was racist, but it was insensitive and he made it at the wrong time."" Stokes, however, said he came to show support for Floyd's and other black lives, because he has seen too many lost to violence, including the 17-year-old son of friends in Georgia. ""He was beaten to death and rolled up in a wrestling mat at the high school,"" he said. ""His death has never been solved."" Four Minneapolis police officers were fired Tuesday. Protests have broken out across the country. On Friday, former police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with Floyd's murder. Petal: Aldermen call for mayor's resignation over George Floyd death comment. He refuses. At least 200 people attended Friday's rally in Petal. A brief fight broke out, but was quickly quelled when Lorraine Bates, a Petal woman who walked 3 miles to city hall for the protest with chains around her feet, grabbed the microphone and started singing a gospel song, which lowered the heated mood.

""If you're in the Petal/Hattiesburg area, we're asking for support in the form of people showing up … in Petal, where two courageous men are protesting outside of the mayor's house,"" a post on Facebook says. ""If you showed up at the protest earlier today and felt like you wanted to keep going, this is definitely the place to be. Let's apply some pressure.""

Council President Hardin tweeted a video with Rep. Beatty saying that they are okay, and called on people on both sides of the protest to remain calm. Beatty said in an interview later Saturday that the pepper spray was “prolific.” “I don’t remember hearing anyone saying, ‘Move or we’re going to pepper spray,’” Beatty said. “Councilman Hardin got the brunt of it and he was in the middle of the sidewalk.” She added that she didn’t think the pepper spray was necessary. “I heard no warning,” she said. “Obviously if someone had said and held up a pepper spray and said, ‘I’m gonna pepper spray,’ we would have moved. Nobody wants to be pepper sprayed, trust me.” A spokesperson for Beatty told NBC4 that while the protest was underway, someone started scuffling with police. Police took that person down, which made other protesters angry. Beatty stepped in to try and calm the situation when police started spraying. Hardin and Boyce pulled Beatty out of the fray. “We understand that tensions are high. Our tensions are high as well. We are angry, and we need change. But the only way we will get change is by peaceful demonstrations,” said Hardin. “While it was peaceful, there were times where people got off the curb, into the street, said Beatty. “Too much force is not the answer this.” Beatty said Saturday’s protest was more peaceful than the protests on Friday night, when stores and businesses were damaged, saying she wanted to be there to support the organizers of Saturday’s protest. “I can tell you 95 percent of the folks were amazing,” Beatty said. She said that in the last 20 minutes she was in the area are when things began to take a turn with the arrival of police on bicycles. “Whatever happened last night, which I am totally against – breaking into buildings, marking up city hall – I am totally against that,” Beatty said. “But there was none of that today and I kept saying to the officers, ‘Do not excite them, do not excite them.’” Beatty added that a handful of protesters got off the sidewalks and into the streets, which is what prompted the police response. “Before we knew it, the bikes were going up against a young sister standing next to me,” she said. “A gentleman was knocked to the ground and then you know what happened. People start pushing and shoving. I got caught in the middle of it. Beatty said Hardin was pepper sprayed more than she was, adding Boyce was there and managed to get Beatty out of the way. Just want to let folks know that when @RepBeatty @VoteBoyce and I were down at the protest we did get sprayed with mace or pepper spray. We are all ok, and we want to encourage folks, both police and protestors, to stay calm. pic.twitter.com/RDQ1p4YDRY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Beatty said she came out to support those protesting injustice. “The message we want to have is we need to be in this together,” Beatty said. “We need to be fighting against the injustices, fighting against racism and tensions are high when you think about George Floyd, but when you are out there and you come in an antagonistic way, it only excites a riot.” She is asking protesters to stop “tearing up” the city and asking officers to stop antagonizing protesters, adding the officers were too aggressive toward excited protesters who were on the sidewalk who “may have had a toe off the sidewalk.” “I was there because I wanted the young protesters to know that in solidarity that I stand with them,” Beatty said. “You know, I’m a grandmother, I’m an elected official, but I’m a black woman first and I felt the pain. So I was there on the edge of the sidewalk when it all happened, wanting to support and feeling the need to protect this young sister. She was very vocal, but that’s freedom of speech. To push and shove and use a bicycle against her, I just think there could have been a better way.” Thanks to whoever gave me that milk. pic.twitter.com/q82XcPChaY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Hardin released the following statement Saturday night: “I’m angry and frustrated. Folks are being shot down while jogging and suffocating under the knee of injustice. Today, I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation. I also saw police going too far, and that’s unacceptable. The people have spoken, and I hear you. The time for commissions and studies is over. The time to institute real police reform is now.  “Columbus needs to establish independent investigations into police use of force, including negotiating a Civilian Review Commission into the next police contract. Columbus needs to change the use of crowd dispersal techniques, as recommended by the Matrix report.

Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

Boykin was indicted by a Lowndes County Grand Jury for manslaughter in 2016 for the October 16, 2015, shooting death of Ricky Ball. Boykin, along with then-officers Max Branch and Yolanda Young, pulled over a car in which Ball was a passenger. Ball fled, and Boykin shot him – he alleged that Ball pointed a gun at him. Ball continued to run, despite his injuries, eventually collapsing between several houses along 14th Avenue North. A handgun the belonged to then-CPD officer Garrett Mittan was found beside the body. Mittan, who was one of officers on scene that night, claimed that it had been stolen from his home in a burglary. None of the officers involved in the shooting had their body cameras on when the confrontation took place. Boykin was fired by the city for violating the department’s body camera policy, for having his then-girlfriend in the police car as an unauthorized ride-along, and for posting offensive and racially insensitive material on social media. District Attorney Scott Colom, then newly elected, decided to hand the case over to the state to prosecute to avoid the appearance of impropriety. The AG’s Office released a terse press release on May 28 stating that the charges would be dropped. The move comes as protests against the slayings of unarmed African-Americans by police sweep the nation. Colom called a press conference Friday morning to talk about the dismissal. He said the timing of the decision was horrible, said that he found out about it from local activists before he was told by the AG, and said that he intends to put as much of the evidence from the case as possible up on his web site so that the public can judge for themselves what happened. Colom said Friday morning that he had not seen the filing asking for the dismissal. “I have not seen the filing or the paperwork to know what justification they gave,” he said. “I found out about it from some local activists who called me, and then sometime (Thursday) afternoon someone from the AG’s office called and notified me.” The Ball shooting happened while Colom was campaigning for the position of district attorney against longtime incumbent Forrest Allgood. “I remember going to a forum at Hunt school and people asked me what I thought about it and I said I thought there should be a grand jury investigation,” Colom said. “When I was elected the attorney general was Jim Hood. I got to know the people in the Public Integrity Unit, and we had some conversations about how to handle officer-involved shootings, and how sensitive they were and how we could make sure that people in Columbus feel safe. “I really trusted that the AG’s office would do the right thing as far as following the evidence and following the facts,” he said. “I made the decision to transfer the case to the AG’s office and to let them present the case to a grand jury. When I did that there were certain conditions on it. The agreement was that there would be a grand jury investigation and if there was an indictment it would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It was indicted, and since that time I’ve followed it through the news and through the courthouse just like other people and I know that there have been several attempts to dismiss the charge by the defendant, and those attempts were always denied. “In 2019 Jim Hood ran for governor and was not successful,” he said. “Lynn Fitch became the attorney general, and the people I had talked to about that case no longer work for the attorney general’s office. New prosecutors were assigned to the case. As a district attorney I am not going to criticize that decision without knowing the factual basis for it. Nobody has told me why they dismissed the charges. I don’t know if they’ve gotten new information in or if there was some reason they felt like they ethically could not go forward. Hopefully that information will come out, because we deserve more than a two-paragraph press release about a case this sensitive. “The timing of this dismissal could not have been worse,” he said. “With what’s going on across the country, with the events in Minnesota where somebody appears to have been murdered on camera, with the situation in Georgia where a person was chased down by private citizens and shot and killed, if you pay attention to social media or to the news at all you can tell that people are very upset. I feel like this was terrible timing to dismiss the charges. It was very insensitive to the people of Columbus and the people involved in this case. “There should have been a better way to do this,” he said. “Part of the problem you have with a dismissal and a two-paragraph press release is that it’s done in the dark. People don’t know what the reason is that they dismissed the case. People don’t get to examine the evidence for themselves. They don’t get a chance to see if this was a judgment made on the facts and the law. The AG’s can’t go through their reasoning on every case, but this isn’t every case. This is a case that caused a lot of people concern. There were a lot of questions about what happened, particularly about the gun found near (Ball’s) body that belonged to an officer that was on scene. That is a serious question, and if you dismiss a case with very little explanation then it further creates distrust within the community for law enforcement and it makes it harder to prosecute cases. Our criminal justice system is based on trust, and without trust it cannot work. “What I think the AG has to do to make sure this community understands why it was dismissed after five years is they have to as soon as possible release all the evidence, pre-indictment, post-indictment. I am going to send them a letter this afternoon asking for the evidence as soon as possible, and as soon as I get it I’m putting it on my web site for everybody to see. We cannot allow this case to disappear in darkness. We have to let people see the evidence for themselves. On a case like this everybody needs to make a decision for themselves. That is my number one priority right now is to get the entire case back from the AG, and subject to privacy concerns I am going to release whatever I can release. That is a step in the direction of transparency, which is key for rebuilding trust.” Colom said the request from the AG is not one that can be denied. “Once the AG makes the decision to not prosecute the case, it is not a situation where the judge can disagree,” he said. “The judge cannot force the AG’s office to prosecute. It’s over. This is not something the judge can control. Some people asked me on social media if I can reopen the case. If it was dismissed with prejudice, it’s over. Double jeopardy attaches, and it’s over. If it’s dismissed without prejudice, the only way the case can be presented to the grand jury again is if there is new information that the previous AG didn’t have. You can’t grand jury shop and just take a case to a new grand jury. “I wish there was more I could say or do to comfort the Ball family,” he said. “I can only imagine what they’re going through in a situation where they have had to wait four or five years to see if there’s going to be justice, or at least a trial to see what the evidence is. A new AG comes in and all of a sudden there’s a dismissal, that’s not going to build trust in the criminal justice system. I will do everything in my power to get the evidence out to the people, because they have a right to see it for themselves. When it comes to a case I transfer to the AG’s office, there has to be some communication from them. Now there’s a new regime, and we can’t have cases handled this way. They are too important and too sensitive. We can’t have cases dismissed like this with no real heads-up. I had somebody call me last night and tell me that they thought this was a gut punch. It would have been much better if they had known why. It is not normal for cases to be dismissed after an indictment. That is the part where I feel like we have got to get more information.” Colom said he is not aware of any legal deadline that required the decision to have been made right now. “The courts can’t even have juries until the 15th,” he said. “I don’t see a legal reason for this to be done right now. Boykin is out on bond, so you don’t have to worry about him being detained. There is no push, they didn’t file a motion for a speedy trial. The defendant has been trying to get this dismissed since the beginning, and the previous AG’s office fought it. The judge kept denying it. I can’t think of a legal reason to do it right now. “If they had asked me I would have told them not to do it right now and not to do it the way they did it,” he said. “You’ve got to give people the reason and the evidence why you’re dismissing a case like this, particularly at a time when distrust of law enforcement is at its height.” The lack of transparency is damaging to law enforcement, he said. “I don’t expect us to have riots over this, I really don’t,” he said. “Even if we don’t have one riot or one protest, some people are not going to trust the justice system after this. They are going to witness a shooting and say they don’t know what happened. We have shootings with hundreds of people there, and no witnesses. We have got to do our part to have trust, because so much of the criminal justice system is based on trust. You’ve got to have trust to report crimes, to get evidence about crimes, to bring indictments, to get convictions. If people do not trust you it’s basically a house of cards. My concern is making sure the evidence is public so people can decide for themselves. The citizens need to be able to make up their minds themselves.” Colom said that he felt like local officials should have been given some warning. “If I had been the AG and I was going to dismiss a case like this, I would have spoken to the local district attorney, to the police chief, to the sheriff, to the mayor, weeks in advance,” he said. “Then you can get some advice from the local elected officials for what is the appropriate way to do that. Don’t do it in a two-paragraph press release. You can have a hearing for a dismissal. I would have had a hearing, I would have put on evidence, I would have put out the videos, I would have let the people see the reason for my decision. “Some people will say that I transferred the case to the AG and so lost my ability to do that,” he said. “All I can say is hindsight is 20/20. At the time I transferred it there were people I knew and trusted handling the case. I don’t anticipate they ever would have dismissed the case and told me about it afterwards.” Colom said he wanted to get the evidence from the AG’s officer within 10-14 days. “The case is closed, as far as they’re concerned,” he said. “There is not nearly as much legal justification for withholding it. My goal is to get the letter to them today. We need to get it out there as soon as possible. This can’t be something where six months from now we’re still waiting. I want to get it out there in 10-14 days. Everything that does not involve privacy laws I’m going to put on my web site so people can make up their minds for themselves.” Colom said body camera footage, especially, should be released. “There’s been a lot said about the officer not having his body camera on at the time of the shooting, which would have told us what happened,” Colom said. “There are other officers who arrived on scene and were there when Ricky Ball’s body was found, and they did have their cameras on. So there is some body camera video of what occurred that night. That would be important because then you would see the officers arrive on the scene and find the gun on camera. There’s a lot of controversy about the gun, and we need to get the information out there because people need to know there wasn’t a cover-up.” Colom said now that the case is closed the evidence should all be public record. “Unless they can find some exceptions I’m not aware of,” he said. “My whole thing is that I hope that by me taking the lead on getting the information that it will be smooth and we can get it out there. I hope they will understand the necessity to bring some transparency to the decision-making.” It will take actions, not words, to rebuild trust with the justice system, he said. “I don’t think there’s anything I can say that will alleviate the pain and the distrust that some people are feeling,” he said. “What I will have to do, what (Police Chief Fred Shelton) will have to do, what (Mayor Robert Smith) is going to have to do, what the city council is going to have to do, is earn their trust.”",0.0

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd’s death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed.our special coverage,to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see A photograph of a group of people in white hoods standing next to pickup trucks has gone viral, leading to rumors that the Ku Klux Klan — known for their signature garb — gathered in Mississippi in late May 2020 on the heels of unrest in Minneapolis after the death of a black man while in police custody. The group, which has existed in various forms in the United States since 1865, is known for its long history of organized violence and campaigns against black people, including cross burnings, lynchings, and marches. As protests continued around the United States in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd, who was handcuffed and pinned to the ground for several minutes by a white Minneapolis police officer, this image spread across social media: But this photograph is not from May 2020, nor was it taken in Mississippi. This photograph initially went viral in early February, at which time social media users were claiming it depicted a gathering of the KKK in Caroline County, Maryland. A reporter from the Maryland newspaper The Star Democrat spoke to police there in February to confirm it was a hoax. Michael McDermott, police chief of Federalsburg, a town in Caroline County, agreed with their findings, adding that “Maybe whoever is responsible for this is just trying to stir up trouble.” Before making its way to Facebook, the photo reportedly originated on Snapchat: … McDermott said the picture was also posted on the Federalsburg Police Department Facebook page with the poster making disparaging comments about the town. The post circulated first on SnapChat before making its way across Facebook. Police do not believe the photo was taken in Federalsburg or in Caroline County or even anywhere near the area. But, after being screenshot multiple times, a caption had been added across the picture making reference to “burg” or Federalsburg and with the additional caption, “We from the south of the county our #1 enemy them racist…white people.” The actual origins of the photograph are undetermined. Snopes has reached out to the chief of police in Federalsburg to learn more, and we will update this story with more information as it becomes available. Here’s what we do know: This photograph does not show a KKK gathering in Mississippi in May 2020, and, according to Maryland police, the claim that such a gathering occurred in or around Caroline County was a hoax. We are unable to determine the actual origins and location of the picture, leading to the rating of “Miscaptioned.”",0.0

Meanwhile in downtown Atlanta, near the headquarters of the CNN television network, groups of protesters smashed store windows, to which the riot police responded with tear gas, according to television broadcasts. Some of the protesters threw rocks at the CNN building and several police vehicles parked outside the premises were also targeted with projectiles, with at least two of them set on fire. In New York, hundreds took to the streets on Friday for the second consecutive day. The first protest was held in Manhattan''s Foley Square, although the most violent actions were recorded in Brooklyn, with three epicentres  Prospect Heights at the Barclays Center, Clinton Hill, and in Fort Greene Park where protesters set fire to an empty police van. In Los Angeles, protesters marched shouting slogans such as ""I can''t breathe"" amid heavy police presence. A police officer was attacked in the street and squad cars'' windows were smashed by protesters, while several people were detained for allegedly throwing objects at officers and damaging police cars. A group of about 100 protesters reportedly blocked a major north-south freeway in downtown Los Angeles.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency.

Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall.

Responding Reno police fired tear gas into City Hall. Items such as a couch inside were on fire but soon put out. Police dispersed the protesters as some chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot.""

Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that."" He added: ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here, who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles."" He said the situation was started by a group of protesters converging on the police car and attacking it. Other video showed at least one vehicle on fire. An initially peaceful demonstration in the city had spiraled into chaos Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. Video posted to social media on Friday showed officers using batons and shoving protesters as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her. Denver: Car crashes into police; weapons confiscated Three officers and a civilian were ""severely"" injured when a car crashed into a Denver police vehicle, the police department tweeted late Saturday. Police said they were searching for a Chevrolet compact car with Wyoming plates. The city had enacted a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. A few agitators, the department said, were ""hijacking"" Floyd's memory. Police shared photos of a gun, a gas canister and a hatchet — all of which were confiscated Saturday. ""Last night, agitators brought crowbars, baseball bats, assault rifles, hand guns and improvised flash-bangs which were thrown at police officers and protesters,” Chief Paul Pazen said in a statement on Saturday. Police on Saturday announced 34 arrests over the last two nights in Denver amid Floyd protests. San Francisco: Fireworks outside mayor’s apartment after curfew Videos from the scene show protesters lighting fireworks outside of San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s apartment. Late Saturday, Breed made an announcement alongside the city’s police chief, sheriff and fire chief implementing a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. She also said the National Guard is on standby for the city. “If you are home, please stay home. If you are in our city from other places, please go back to the city that you live in. Please do not come into San Francisco and destroy our city,” Breed said. Breed said there were peaceful protests early Saturday, but the violence and vandalism exhibited later in the day are “something we will not tolerate.” Chief Bill Scott said officers were dealing with looting and people breaking windows.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds. President Donald Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida during the afternoon, but arrived back at the White House around 8:30 p.m. as protests raged outside. As the presidential helicopters buzzed overheard near the White House grounds, some demonstrators shouted obscenities and shook their fists.

Police responded by pushing the crowd away, firing tear gas and bean bag rounds as they marched forward. At one point, some in the crowd tried to build a makeshift barrier with trash cans, but police pushed through and arrested several people. Others fled down streets and alleys. — Dan Horn, Madeline Mitchell, Cameron Knight and Sharon Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer Des Moines, Iowa: Protesters throw fireworks at police Police in riot gear met protesters marching on the state’s Capitol building.

One person was seen breaking a glass window. — Des Moines Register staff Minneapolis: Projectiles fired to clear protesters The National Guard started moving into downtown Minneapolis on Saturday, after days of unrest. ""The situation in Minnesota is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cites,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As curfew approached, hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of journalists gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct.

Police set up skirmish lines throughout the downtown area and fired non-lethal ammunition in at least one incident, City News Service reported. Garcetti requested the National Guard. Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C. Penney Protests turned violent in Fayetteville even after police opted to close access to downtown areas of the city.

When police horses entered the area, a chaotic few seconds followed: Police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Glass bottles flew through the air. At one point the crowd chanted: ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. That demonstration had apparently ended without arrests, and the police had largely let it play out on its own, without interference. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. — Laura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Detroit: Day starts peacefully, turns violent Saturday, in the light of day, the protesting crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, with police following marching protesters closely and even handing out masks, a coronavirus precaution, to those who did not have them.

In the skirmishes, Detroit Free Press reporters were exposed to tear gas, and a phone was violently knocked out of a photographer's hand. Police in riot gear, supported by armored cars, moved toward protesters. Crowds began to gather at about 4:30 p.m. Most wore masks, and many carried signs, some with angry slogans.

Gov. Tim Walz is vowing that tonight will be different. At an earlier evening press conference, the governor said that National Guard troops will bring security and safety to the streets of the Twin Cities this evening. He once again urged residents to obey an 8 p.m. curfew. It was Walz’s third press conference of the day as Twin Cities residents braced for a possible fifth night of unrest following the killing of George Floyd in police custody. Earlier in the day, the governor fully mobilized the National Guard in response to looting and fires that state officials claim have been largely committed by people who don’t live in the area. Walz said he watched protesters march peacefully through South Minneapolis this afternoon demanding justice for Floyd. He said the peaceful demonstrators reflected Minnesota values. “Tonight is different,” he said. The people in the streets tonight “are not our neighbors. They are not the people who did the work to build Lake Street, to build community.” Walz was asked how he knew that people engaged in looting and burning are from outside the state. He said that assertion was based on intelligence gleaned by state officials had. “Whether they’re from Minnesota or not, if they’re out there tonight, they’re not sharing our values,” he said. Walz promised that authorities would rigidly enforce the curfew tonight to keep residents and businesses safe a day after thousands of people flaunted the curfew in Minneapolis. “If you go out on the streets tonight, the assumption is going to be that you’re there to engage in wanton destruction.” “We’re asking for you to let the National Guard have the street after 8 p.m. so that we make sure we can restore order,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told reporters at a noon briefing. “We need to be able to stop the burning and the looting and the destruction.” In emotional and sometimes angry tones, Walz, Ellison and other officials and faith leaders delivered the same message: People must obey the nighttime curfew despite their anger over Floyd’s killing. “My heart and guts are being ripped out at this moment because I also want to go to the streets” to protest Floyd’s killing in police custody, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said. But “there are white supremacists there. There are anarchists. There are people who are burning down institutions that are core to our identity,” she said. “Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us. Remove those folks who are detracting from the memory of George Floyd.” Walz warned it would be dangerous Saturday night on the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, invoking comparisons to war-torn parts of Somalia and Iraq. Outsiders, extremists They are among those fomenting violence in Twin Cities After the chaos Friday night into Saturday, officials became convinced that the worst of the violence and looting is coming from bands of people using the grief over Floyd’s death as an opportunity for crime. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington described them overnight as an “armed … entrenched group of rioters.” Walz is fully mobilizing the Guard in the Twin Cities in its largest-ever civilian deployment to stem violence on the streets of Minneapolis in the wake of Floyd’s death on Monday. Guard officials said a contingent of nearly 2,500 soldiers will be on hand in Minneapolis on Saturday night; in the coming days, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Guard soldiers could be involved in the ""full activation"" — the largest domestic deployment in the 164-year history of the Minnesota's National Guard. ""The Minnesota National Guard is prepared to protect life, protect property and restore order,"" the Guard said in a news release. ""This includes patrols, manning control points, and assisting firefighters in accomplishing their life saving mission by providing security."" The Minnesota Department of Transportation announced Saturday evening that it was closing several major freeways in the Twin Cities from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday: Interstate 35W between I-694 and Highway 62 Interstate 35E between Highway 36 and Highway 62 Interstate 94 between I-694 on the west and the I-494/694 interchange on the east Interstate 394 eastbound between Highway 100 and I-94 Highway 55 (Hiawatha Avenue) between Highway 62 and I-94 MnDOT said “routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas” in Minneapolis and St. Paul, but did not elaborate. The governor said peaceful protests over the killing of Floyd were hijacked by outsiders he said included white supremacists and drug cartels trying to take advantage of the unrest. “Last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd's death, or inequities, or historical traumas to our communities of color,” Walz said earlier, “because our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand-in-hand to save businesses that took generations to build.” Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington vowed a stronger police presence and a change in tactics “because this is intolerable and we are coming to stop it.” The Pentagon said Saturday it was ready to provide military help to authorities scrambling to contain unrest in Minneapolis, but Walz has not requested federal troops. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said several military units have been placed on higher alert “as a prudent planning measure” in case Walz asks for help. On Saturday, President Trump spoke at the White House after protests turned to rioting in some cities around the United States. Trump urged Minnesota officials to get tougher with protesters who are destroying property and looting, saying by getting tougher, political leaders in Minnesota would be honoring the memory of Floyd. As of 8 a.m. a fire was burning out of control at a Walgreens on Lake Street at 32nd Avenue; neighbors used garden hoses to try to keep the fire from spreading to nearby homes until fire crews arrived. Crews were battling another fire affecting a couple of retail stores near Nicollet Avenue at 35th Street. As state and local authorities brace for another night of massive protests, the Minneapolis City Council Saturday afternoon voted to extend Mayor Jacob Frey’s emergency declaration to June 12, which allows the city to request and receive additional federal and state help to quell civil unrest. Community gathers to clean up damage In the wake of Friday night’s chaos, some in Minneapolis gathered Saturday morning to prepare and protect their neighborhoods against possible violence later in the evening. Sam Gould was among the organizers of one of those meetings, at Powderhorn Park. He said authorities abandoned the neighborhood the night before. ""The Midtown Global Market has literally been under attack by undisclosed white men with guns and bats and crowbars trying to burn down the building for the last three nights in a row — no help from the police or National Guard at all,"" he said. Gould also said they talked about rebuilding damaged buildings and businesses in the wake of the destruction. Volunteers flocked to Lake Street to volunteer in the post-riot cleanup effort in Minneapolis on Saturday. Courtney Perry for MPR News ""We're going to be experiencing this for years to come. This type of (community rebuilding) work is going to be vital. We can't keep expecting the city or the state or the nonprofit industrial complex in this state to lift us up. We're going to be lifting ourselves up and we're going to look out for one another,"" he said. Volunteers gathered along Lake Street and in other neighborhoods on Saturday to help clean up the previous night's damage — including at the East Lake branch library. Kim Doss-Smith and her husband Patrick, who have lived in the neighborhood for more than 20 years, were among those helping at the fire-damaged library. They said what appeared to be a small splinter group broke away from the main crowd late Friday, and vandalized the library. The couple and others who stepped in to assist helped extinguish the fire; they also chased away people who tried to cause damage. They called the fire department and, they said, were told no fire crews were available. Kim Doss-Smith said she also saw a couple of people ready to throw Molotov cocktails at the adjacent Holy Trinity Lutheran Church. “I talked to them, and I said, 'This church is important to me. It has been consistent as a peace and justice church addressing racial bias. And it's the only place feeding people in the neighborhood now that all the grocery stores are gone. You guys want to think really hard before you torch this church. And they — they went away,"" she said.  How to help Volunteering, community efforts this weekend in Twin Cities Friday curfew defied Thousands of people defied an 8 p.m. Friday curfew. Many eventually gathered around the 5th Precinct station on Nicollet, south of Lake Street. Several businesses in that area were looted and several fires started, before the crowd was dispersed by a large law enforcement response. Fires were reported elsewhere along Lake Street overnight, as well as along Broadway in north Minneapolis. It was quieter in St. Paul Friday night, but Mayor Melvin Carter said several people were arrested related to the ongoing violence — and all of them were from out of state. He said local residents who have been pushing for police reform and advocating for communities of color for years don’t know the people committing criminal acts. “As I talk to my friends who've been in this movement for a very long time, who wake up in this movement every day, and I ask them, what they're seeing, what they're feeling, what they're hearing,” Carter said. “I hear them say, 'We don't know these folks. We don't know these folks who are agitating.’” Walz said at an early morning news conference that another 1,000 National Guard troops — a total of 1,700 — are being called to Minneapolis, making it the largest deployment within Minnesota in state history. Walz said law enforcement and Guard troops were outnumbered late Friday and early Saturday, and had to prioritize what to protect. ""When the business that you fought your life for to try and get burns down, that seems like a pretty damn critical asset to you,"" he said. ""[But] we're protecting the federal reserve, we're protecting infrastructure downtown, we're protecting power stations and things like that."" Walz said groups who are only interested in destruction have taken over the protests in the wake of Floyd's death. ""Why are we talking about anarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were businesses built up by our indigenous and black communities, instead of talking about we had a horrific situation where a police officer murdered and was charged for the death of a black man?"" he said. Walz said the state has intelligence that white supremacists and drug cartels might also be trying to take advantage of the unrest. Officer charged in Floyd killing Meanwhile, the former Minneapolis police officer caught on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck has been charged in the man’s killing, as the mayors of the Twin Cities have ordered nighttime curfews through the weekend aimed at stemming the violence. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd, who died after being knelt on his neck by Chauvin for several minutes on Monday. Screenshot Derek Chauvin faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. He was arrested Friday morning. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said he anticipated charges for three other officers connected to the incident who were also fired, but “we felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, including two minutes and 53 seconds when Floyd was unresponsive, according to the criminal complaint. ""Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,” the complaint reads. The initial emergency dispatch call on Monday had little urgency — a caller from the Cup Foods store on Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis reporting someone using “fake bills.” In a transcript released earlier in the week by the Minneapolis police, the caller tells a dispatcher they asked the man to return the cigarettes he bought but that the man is “drunk and not in control of himself” and refuses to give back the cigarettes. According to Friday’s criminal complaint, Chauvin and his partner Tou Thao arrived at the scene as two other officers, Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng, were trying to get Floyd into the back of a squad, but Floyd said he was claustrophobic and didn't want to get in the car, and that he complained of not being able to breathe even while he was standing up. Floyd took himself to the ground while in cuffs at 8:19 p.m., according to the charging document. That's when Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's head and neck area. Despite the danger of that technique, the complaint says officers told Floyd that he could talk, so he was fine. Prosecutors say the officers kept holding Floyd down even after he stopped talking and breathing. According to the charges Lane asked Chauvin if they should roll Floyd over. Chauvin allegedly said no and to keep him there. Prosecutors say Lane persisted, saying he was concerned that Floyd was experiencing a syndrome called “excited delirium” which can lead to sudden death, but Chauvin allegedly refused to roll Floyd over. ‘Road to justice’ Freeman said the charges against Chauvin are the same as those that came down against Mohamed Noor, the ex-Minneapolis police officer found guilty in the on-duty killing of 911 caller Justine Ruszczyk in 2017. Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines recommend 12 1/2 years for a conviction on the murder count and four years on the manslaughter charge. After he was convicted last year, Noor got exactly the 12 1/2-year guidelines sentence. Ben Crump, the attorney for Floyd's family, said in a statement that while the charges against Chauvin are a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,” the family expected the fired officer to face a first-degree murder charge. “We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” he said. During an earlier news conference Friday, Harrington, the state’s public safety director, referred to Floyd’s death as murder. “We’ll call it a murder. That’s what it looked like to me,” Harrington said while noting that the majority of people protesting Floyd’s death were doing so peacefully. “I don’t want to prejudice this from a criminal perspective. I’m just calling it what I see it at that point."" Following Chauvin’s arrest, Gov. Tim Walz wrote on Twitter that “Chauvin's actions were horrific. His arrest is a good first step toward justice for George Floyd. But it doesn't change the systemic problems and persistent inequities that led to his death or the pain our communities live with every day. We’re committed to change.” Separately from the state probe, FBI officials say they are investigating Floyd’s death for possible federal civil rights violations. Tensions boil again, despite curfews In Minneapolis and St. Paul, the mayors’ curfews started at 8 p.m. Friday and last until 6 a.m. Saturday, then restarting at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. Gov. Tim Walz reinforced the city orders with one from his office. Demonstrators in Minneapolis Friday night, however, defied the city’s curfew, setting the stage for confrontations with police for another night.

As the sun set Friday, however, it appeared the order would not keep people off the Twin Cities’ streets. Earlier Friday, St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell said he’s asked for 400 members of the State Patrol and National Guard to help patrol St. Paul, which saw swaths, of destruction and looting Thursday, especially in the Midway neighborhood. City police said more than 170 business had been damaged or looted overnight but with no serious injuries. Officers made seven arrests and responded to hundreds of calls, including 89 “shots fired” calls. Fires and looting were reported in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood this week as violent protesters and looters spilled into the city from across the Mississippi River. David H.

Still, the incidents provoked concern from a range of advocacy groups.""Journalists have a clear First Amendment right to cover public events,"" Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Parker Higgins said in a statement.CNN reporter describes arrest, power of capturing something on videoIn Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters have been calling for accountability for a black woman who was fatally shot by police in March, reporters for WLKY were targeted by protesters on Friday night.

The incident was broadcast live on the air. ""Who are they aiming that at?"" the anchor asked. ""At us,"" the reporter replied.The reporter, Kaitlin Rust, and her cameraman were ""courageously and lawfully"" covering the news when they were targeted, the station said in a statement. ""There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.""Louisville Metro Police Special Advisor Jessie Halladay issued an apology to Rust. Halladay said she had reviewed the video and said the incident was not something that should have occurred if Rust was singled out as a reporter.Many TV networks are dispatching private security guards to support journalists who are in the field at protests.""These situations could have been much worse had it not been for security,"" Dolan said.Security guards were involved when a Fox News crew was harassed and chased out of Lafayette Park, one block from the White House, on Friday night. Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media.Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence.

""If you can say you can't breathe, you're breathing,"" he wrote before deleting his Twitter account. Marx added that he didn't see anything ""unreasonable"" in Chauvin's conduct. ""Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack,"" he wrote. ""Video doesn't show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" Police and protesters gather near the Minneapolis Police third precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 27, 2020. Adam Bettcher/Reuters In an interview with the Hattiesburg American, Marx said his statements had been misinterpreted. ""I can't say whether a crime was committed or whether they did anything right or wrong, all I'm saying is don't rush to judgment based on what you see in that video,"" he told the paper. ""I've seen too many cases before where the police were judged to be guilty in the public's eye but later were found to be not guilty under the law,"" Marx added. He did not provide any examples. On Thursday, the Petal Board of Aldermen voted unanimously in a special session to call for Marx's resignation, Mississippi Clarion-Ledger reported. He refused, saying, ""I will never surrender to the mob mentality."" According to Mississippi law, an elected mayor can only be forcibly removed if convicted of a felony.  ""The city of Petal and the cities surrounding have grown to be a place where individuals of all walks, backgrounds, and beliefs are valued, supported and celebrated,"" Alderman Clint Moore said in a statement, according to the Hattiesburg American. Moore said Marx's comments ""have isolated, enraged, and belittled individuals in a way that is unbecoming to our city."" Marx told the board he and his family have received death threats as a result of his tweet. He has deleted his Twitter account and made his Facebook page private. Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and co-author of ""Evaluating Police Uses of Force,"" said the position Floyd was placed in by Chauvin easily could have led to his death. In positional or compression asphyxia, Stoughton said, a subject is able to breathe enough to speak but ""they're not able to draw enough oxygen over an extended period of time to maintain basic life functions."" ""Officers need to understand that there's ventilation, and there's respiration,"" Stoughton told Insider. ""You and I can hold our breath and still talk. We don't need to breathe to talk.

Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,” the memo said. 3 a.m. ETPORTLAND —Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers.Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance.Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon’s largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland.

Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J.

An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama.

THE MAYOR SAYS THE CURRENT CURFEW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND IS NOT TO STIFLE PROTESTS Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Some US states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The longest economic expansion in American history is officially over. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

Mississippi Clarion Ledger The city of Oxford and the Ole Miss sports family are beginning to speak out about the protests, riots and national response to the death of George Floyd. Floyd died recently after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes while he was on the ground. That event has led to a national outcry, including protests, marches and riots across the country. The protests have even reached Oxford, where about 300 people gathered at The Square on Saturday evening to march and support the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters chanted refrains such as “no justice, no peace” and held a moment of silence after listing off the names of black victims of police brutality. They gathered for a couple hours and marched two laps around The Square before leaving when their permit expired. A handful of protesters remained and chanted on a sidewalk, though a majority of the protesters left when the police asked. There's a sizable gathering of folks peacefully gathered on The Square here in Oxford. Protestors here to remember George Floyd and speak for equality. pic.twitter.com/XZMnFTtTZa — Nick Suss (@nicksuss) May 30, 2020 Members of the Ole Miss sports family have made their opinions on the protests known. Athletic director Keith Carter released a statement Sunday morning saying that all people must “work together to be a part of the solution that gives equality and justice to everyone.” With select student-athletes returning to campus on June 8, Carter said he wants those athletes to know Ole Miss is paying attention to the state of the nation and will “lead with love and compassion.” More: New Ole Miss football player speaks out against Mississippi flag on social media Ole Miss football coach Lane Kiffin tweeted about the protests on Saturday, using the hashtag “Prayers for George Floyd” in response to a post from Hall of Fame football coach Tony Dungy. Dungy advocated for love and prayer in response to violence. One of Kiffin’s assistant coaches, co-defensive coordinator Chris Partridge, also posted a statement. “For real change to happen, we all need to step out of our comfort zone,” Partridge said in a tweet. “We need to stand together to affect change. Let all the pure of heart hear the screams of our country’s people, rise for justice and defeat evil.” More: Petal protest day 2: Rally continues as hundreds call for mayor's resignation Ole Miss women’s basketball coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin tweeted her support of Saturday’s Oxford protests. “My husband is black, I am black, my players majority are black and I have black friends,” McPhee-McCuin said in a later tweet. “We are scared, tired and feeling hopeless!

Someone spray-painted the phrase “spiritual genocide” along the side of the statue. At the rally on The Square, Oxford’s two Confederate statues were brought up by protesters, with people at the rally at one point chanting “take them down.” The University of Mississippi has not yet put out an official statement about the protests or the vandalism of the statue.

1621659745,2020-05-31 10:17:32,‘We’re sick of it’: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.wjtv.com/news/were-sick-of-it-anger-over-police-killings-shatters-us/,en,True,,146692,whlt.com,http://whlt.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621659743,2020-05-31 10:19:14,Massive US protests raise fears of new virus outbreaks,https://www.wjtv.com/news/massive-us-protests-raise-fears-of-new-virus-outbreaks/,en,True,,146692,whlt.com,http://whlt.com/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

One of Kiffin’s assistant coaches, co-defensive coordinator Chris Partridge, also posted a statement. “For real change to happen, we all need to step out of our comfort zone,” Partridge said in a tweet. “We need to stand together to affect change. Let all the pure of heart hear the screams of our country’s people, rise for justice and defeat evil.” More: Petal protest day 2: Rally continues as hundreds call for mayor's resignation Ole Miss women’s basketball coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin tweeted her support of Saturday’s Oxford protests. “My husband is black, I am black, my players majority are black and I have black friends,” McPhee-McCuin said in a later tweet. “We are scared, tired and feeling hopeless! I love ALL people! Just want to feel safe! Want to be respected. Don’t want to be hunted! We must LOVE! Love conquers all!” Police have put a tarp over and barricaded the Confederate monument on Ole Miss' campus after it was vandalized Saturday evening. (Photo: Nick Suss/Clarion Ledger) In addition to the march in Oxford Saturday night, a Confederate statue on the Ole Miss campus was vandalized. Someone spray-painted the phrase “spiritual genocide” along the side of the statue. At the rally on The Square, Oxford’s two Confederate statues were brought up by protesters, with people at the rally at one point chanting “take them down.” The University of Mississippi has not yet put out an official statement about the protests or the vandalism of the statue. More: Confederate statues vandalized at Ole Miss, other cities Oxford mayor Robyn Tannehill posted a long statement on Facebook on Saturday admitting that she can't speak specifically to the experience of being black in America but saying that she is praying for community and unity, her heart aches for Floyd and she wants to see the citizens of Oxford help affect change one person at a time.

I'm protesting to prove that black communities can unite peacefully to invoke change."" The city and police department provided traffic assistance to allow the march to progress safely. Joseph Grant of Hattiesburg said he came to the march ""because Facebook is not enough."" ""I'm tired,"" he said. I'm tired of arguing with my high school classmates, with college classmates, with people. I want them to understand that if we are going to make a change we are going to have to step outside of this social media thing."" Down the street, Mississippi state flag supporters rallied at the entrance to the University of Southern Mississippi, which the group has been doing every Sunday since Southern Miss replaced the state flag -- which includes the Confederate battle emblem in its canon -- with the U.S. flag. The group displays the flag and other confederate emblems and wave to passersby, some who often honk in support of the group. Their signs did not mention Floyd's death. On May 25, Floyd's arrest was captured on video by a bystander. Four Minneapolis officers were fired after Floyd's death and one was charged with his murder. On Saturday, at least 300 protesters gathered peacefully in Petal to continue the call for Mayor Hal Marx's resignation — nearly double the attendance at Friday's protest. Unorganized and impromptu protests followed at the mayor's home both days. Mayor refuses to quit: Petal aldermen call for mayor's resignation over George Floyd death comment. Marx and his wife Mindy spoke with the Hattiesburg American from their home about their concerns and fears over the protests and regret for Marx's Twitter comment that ignited the calls for his resignation.

(Story continues after photo gallery.) Tempers flared at Friday's protest and a brief scuffle ensued. It was quickly put out when longtime activist Lorraine Bates grabbed the microphone and began singing a gospel song and encouraging others to join her. Petal protest day 2: Rally continues as hundreds call for mayor's resignation Petal protest day 1: Protesters call for ouster of Petal mayor over George Floyd death comments No one was arrested. On Thursday, Petal aldermen held a special meeting to pass a resolution asking the mayor to resign. The aldermen also voted to censure the mayor for his actions. Both votes were unanimous. Other items on the agenda seeking to reduce the mayor's salary and enact a strict social media policy were tabled until an attorney general's opinion could be obtained. George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Marx said even though his comment was made in haste and wasn't well thought, he didn't believe what he said warranted such harsh reaction. By Sunday afternoon, a petition on change.org calling for the mayor’s resignation had nearly 15,000 signatures. Petal has a population of around 11,000. Protests over Floyd's death were held in other areas of the state over the weekend, including Oxford, where a Confederate statue was vandalized. Across the country, other protests have erupted in violence and looting following Floyd's death and the arrest of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin days after video circulated of him holding his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd said he could not breathe. The latest: George Floyd, Derek Chauvin knew each other. 'No signs of asphyxia' in Floyd's death USA TODAY said a preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to a criminal complaint released Friday.

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction.

""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes. After the moment was done, protesters dispersed from the area for the time being.""We've talked about many times in this building and everybody, every man and woman in the Des Moines Police Department knows what happened up there was wrong,"" said Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement President Trump briefly taken to underground bunker during Friday's White House protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protesters gathered outside the White House Friday night in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker for a period of time, according to a White House official.The president was there for a little under an hour before being brought upstairs. It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

Another 30 mostly younger people marched from the library to the courthouse in protest mid-afternoon. Morning event organizer Paula Winters-Bayne of Wesley United Methodist Church, preached peace and unity. The half-hour gathering featured prayer and song, and included comments from Mayor Jimmy Cockroft, who noted that Kosciusko has never experienced the overt racial tension of many other communities. “It’s a tough time, we fight coronavirus and we fight everything else we’ve got going on as a country. This community has always been together, black and white, and we’ve got to stay that way,” said Cockroft. “We know our policemen. They’re not perfect. Jimmy’s not perfect either, but you know these guys. They are not going to mistreat you because of your color… because of anything — male or female, young or old, or black or white.” Before leading a prayer, the Mayor urged men to be leaders and protectors of their families. “…Men, we’re outnumbered again here…. A man’s got to start being a man if this country’s going to change. Plain as day,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what color that man is, but a man’s got to be a man, protect his home and lead his family and take care of his family.” Following the event, Winters-Bayne said she wanted to bring people together to pray and celebrate that the unrest plaguing other communities right now is foreign to Kosciusko. “With everything going on, coronavirus, people afraid… God has not given us a spirit of fear. The shooting, the killing…. We have to love our brothers and sisters as God loves us,” she told The Star-Herald. “Our message today is that our community is a good community. We don’t want to snowball what is going on in other areas to our people; to feel like we have to walk in fear.” “We know our policemen,” she said. “There are protectors in our community and leaders in our community. We just want to be blessed that we don’t have to live in fear.” Winters-Bayne’s niece, Joie Johnson and her friend Alyssa Boston, both KHS graduates, led a younger group carrying protest signs from the Attala County Library to courthouse square on Sunday afternoon. Prior to the march, Kosciusko Police Capt. Josh Pinkard told the group they needed a permit to march, but when the officer left the area, the group proceeded to walk with their signs displayed, chanting and marching along the sidewalks until they reached the courthouse lawn. Once in the same location as the earlier event, Johnson urged the community to join in solving racial injustice. “I feel like if you’re not part of the solution, you are part of the problem,” Johnson told the group after Antonio Riley led a welcome prayer. “Fear is not an excuse to not … protest against things that are an injustice. Because even if we’re not the same race, we really are the same race — the human race. Each one of us matters, true enough,” she said. “When we say ‘black lives matter,’ we’re not excluding any other race,” she said. “We’re just letting you know that we matter, too. When we live in a world that has to remind you that a certain race matters just as much as your life matters, then there is a problem.” “We know there is a problem going on in our town, in our community, in our country and in our world,” Johnson said. Alyssa Boston then recited her poem about racial injustice, ""Wake Up,"" before the group resumed their march. Watch morning video here: Hear audio from afternoon event here.",0.0

Mississippi Clarion Ledger More than 100 people in Jackson on Sunday met outside the Governor's Mansion then rallied outside the nearby Jackson Police Department headquarters downtown to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer on Monday. Bria Williams of Madison, one of the organizers of the protest, said Sunday's rally stemmed from injustice across America. Similar protests took place across the country and in Mississippi over the weekend. ""George Floyd ignited the fire that we had today to come out and protest for black lives,"" Williams said. ""I believe we showed the nation that Mississippi, all races, all ages, all colors can come together to advocate for change in our state and to advocate for justice to be seen sooner than later."" ""I don't have kids right now but I want to have some young sons and daughters and I don't want them to come up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin,"" Williams said. ""That's why we are fighting now."" Samantha Anderson of Terry held a sign that read ""policing is Anti-black"" during the peaceful protest Sunday afternoon. ""Today, you can see how disproportionate black people are affected by policing,"" Anderson said. ""Policing overall is a system that is against black people."" Some protesters were critical of Gov. Tate Reeves, who they said has not adequately addressed the Minneapolis death or issues in Mississippi. Reeves has made only brief comments about Floyd's death and protests in Mississippi, saying he respects people's right to protest, but would ask they do so peacefully. On Sunday, he tweeted: ""There is deep pain and suffering in our country. It is on display right now. We need peace, empathy, and faith to win out. We will not give up on the United States of America. We will work to make it more united."" Williams said: ""Gov. Tate Reeves' tweet is not enough. We feel like the governor of our state should go live, just like he goes live about COVID-19 taking lives, police are taking lives, people are being hurt and murdered due to the color of their skin.

THE MAYOR SAYS THE CURRENT CURFEW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND IS NOT TO STIFLE PROTESTS Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Some US states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The longest economic expansion in American history is officially over. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage.

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing? Not doing nothing, because that's not gonna bring my brother back at all.

Viewer discretion is advised.The latest: Protests continue in major cities like Houston, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, New York City, St. Paul, Orlando. Protests have been largely peaceful.Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. Six Atlanta police officers have been charged after a dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people from a car during protests over the death of George Floyd.The state of Minnesota filed a human rights complaint Tuesday against the Minneapolis Police Department in Floyd's death.Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power, than in principle.” NEW YORK —Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night after night.Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Don't pretend there's not a problem in America. Don't turn your back on racism. Don't accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don't make any more excuses. Don't think this doesn't affect you.

He was pronounced dead shortly after.

Floyd died last Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than 8 minutes. The officer, Derrick Chauvin, was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder. Floyd was black and Chauvin is white. Most of this weekend’s protests were peaceful, however, some turned violent, prompting governors of multiple states to activate the National Guard. Protesters were seen looting, rioting and clashing with police. Dr. Bernice King spoke out during an Atlanta city briefing on Saturday, asking for nonviolence. “As I stand here in this moment and look at my journey, I have to make an appeal to my brothers and sisters, because I realized that the only way to get constructive change is through nonviolent means,” she said. She continued to say that many people have been using her father’s words “riots are the language of the unheard.” Nonviolence is not weak or passive. Nonviolence is active and aggressive. It is strategic, with an ultimate goal. It seeks true peace, which = justice. Even if you disagree with it as a method for social change, I still hear you and love you.

Tate Reeves said he supports the rights of protesters to be heard and will protect their First Amendment right to do so.Protests were sparked around the country and in Mississippi by the killing of George Floyd while in custody of Minneapolis police. The officer who was seen on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was fired and is charged with murder. “Like most people, I came away (from the video) disgusted and dismayed. I pray that justice will be done,” Reeves said. “People around the country have a right to be angry. Not just for this case, but others as well.”Protests have been held outside the governor’s mansion in Jackson. The demonstrations were non-violent and Reeves said he listened from inside his home.“You have a right to protest. It is among the most sacred rights in this country,” Reeves said. “I applaud anyone who uses that right and I will defend your right to do so.”The governor stressed the difference between non-violent protests and looting and riots. Reeves said he does not believe there will be violent demonstrations in Mississippi.“I pray this is true, but I do not believe there will be riots here. I know that the people of Mississippi do not want to burn down our own communities,” Reeves said. “Mississippi protesters want no violence. I want no violence. We are not eager for that possibility, but we are prepared.”Reeves said he believes “anarchists and antagonists” from other parts of the country are behind the violence that he said won’t be tolerated in Mississippi.“I am not threatening, I am promising that the full force of our state will defend our communities,” Reeves said. “We will protect those who are protesting to make it better and we will swiftly and forcefully protect against those who commit violence.

There’s the smoldering police station torched early Thursday morning by protesters enraged by the death of George Floyd while in custody. There’s the Wells Fargo bank branch a couple of blocks away that mobs stormed through the next night, leaving behind a carpet of shattered glass and strewn paperwork. “Kill Bankers” reads the graffiti now spray-painted on an outside wall. Go further up Lake Street and there’s more fresh history: the Somali restaurant with the broken windows, the empty hulk of a burned sneaker store, the boarded-up party supply store owned by a Mexican immigrant who had been praying for the coronavirus lockdown to end so he could reopen. The protests that have roiled Minneapolis night after night didn’t inflame just a single neighborhood: Much of the violence raged up Lake Street, an artery of commerce and culture that cuts across a broad swath of the city. For residents, for businesspeople, for artists, the Lake Street corridor has long been a symbol of the city’s complex history, a block-by-block study in immigration, economic revitalization and persistent inequality. On one end is a trendy district of bars and shopping. On the other are quiet neighborhoods atop the Mississippi River bluff. Between the two is a timeline that spans almost five miles marking each wave of arrivals, along with a tangle of languages spoken in each group’s markets, restaurants, churches and community groups. The Lake Street businesses owned by Suad Hassan’s family are now boarded up, bearing messages like “black owned – solidarity.” Each night, the family has stood guard, successfully begging the mobs to pass them by. The 35-year-old was born in Somalia, but her family fled the country to escape war when she was a child. “When I saw the fire two nights ago, it was like a trauma that was triggered again for me,” she said. “I had put that away in my life a long, long time ago … I told my mom ‘This is a war zone.’” It’s Lake Street’s minority-owned small businesses that may suffer the most from the racial firestorm that hit the city this week. As thousands of people protested a police force with a history of violence against people of color, the collateral damage spread wide — from immigrant-owned restaurants to a center for Native American youth to an affordable housing complex under construction. “What happened with Mr. Floyd is a horror,” said Eduardo Barrera, the general manager of Mercado Central, a cooperative of largely Latino-owned businesses that helped spark economic revitalization along the street when it opened 20 years ago. The muraled corner building was broken into twice during the unrest, with some of its goods stolen. “Nothing changes and people feel they’ve lost everything,” Barrera said. “There’s nothing to lose for them anymore. When there’s no justice, no fairness and no equity, they lose hope.” “But we are hurting ourselves,” he said. Many speculate that Lake Street was hit so hard because its eastern stretch includes the station associated with the white officer now charged with murdering Floyd. The destruction is particularly painful because Lake Street had become a success story, an achievement people took pride in. Residents and business owners say they’ve spent the last 20 years working to revive its chain of neighborhoods — many blighted by years of neglect, suburban flight and disinvestment. Deb Frank moved into the Longfellow neighborhood just off East Lake Street 25 years ago, buying a two-bedroom, 100-year-old home for $40,000. The mail carrier and her neighbors teamed up to rid the area of two brothels by calling in license plates to the police and embarrassing the patrons. Frank and her husband became used to walking to restaurants and coffee shops. “It was a really big transformation,” she said. Today, she wonders: Is it all fleeting? “It took years to get where we were and here we’re back in square one,” she said, noting even the local post office had been damaged enough to disrupt mail service. “No, we’re worse than square one.” By all accounts, immigrant entrepreneurs have been the engine of Lake Street’s repeated resurgences. The stretch, which runs east-west through the city’s south side, has long been a landing pad for recent arrivals to the city. Early in the last century, it was Germans like Emil Schatzlein, who opened a saddle shop on West Lake Street in 1907 that still sells cowboy boots today. And the Scandinavians whose imprint is still visible in the nearly 100-year-old Ingebretsen’s Nordic Marketplace, a local institution known for its lefse and herring. Today, within a couple blocks of Ingebretsen’s, you can buy a bottle of fresh camel milk in an East African grocery and fried tortillas at Taqueria La Poblanita. Just like many American cities, the 1960s saw a stream of white residents and businesses leave Lake Street for the suburbs. Buildings emptied out. By the time the Sears department store abandoned its towering building in the mid-1990s, much of the corridor was desperate for an economic infusion. “It reinvented itself as an immigrant gateway,” said Bill Convery, director of research at the Minnesota Historical Society. “The economic blight led to opportunity.” Somali immigrants fleeing war were among those who soon took advantage of the affordable rents to build businesses. Community organizations reopened the Sears building as the Midtown Global Marketplace, a showcase for food and crafts. Still, the economic progress did not erase the stubborn poverty, the racism or the striking inequality. The corridor’s neighborhoods, along with city’s north side and core, know about police tensions all too well. An ACLU study of city arrests from 2012-2014 found black and Native American people more than eight times more likely than white people to be arrested for low-level offenses. Minneapolis also has wrestled with its growing racial segregation — a division uncomfortably illustrated by driving east on Lake Street, which begins in the overwhelmingly white, quiet and leafy neighborhoods near Uptown before shifting into largely black or mixed neighborhoods. Businesses already were suffering from the pandemic’s stay-at-home orders when the protests started. Gregorio De La Cruz, a Mexican immigrant, was just starting to reopen his two East Lake Street businesses — a party supply and candy store, and a commercial cleaning business — when the violence erupted. Less than a mile from the torched police precinct, he has closed shop again. “I never imagined there would be so much violence in this neighborhood,” he said, his eyes welling up as his 19-year-old daughter translated his Spanish words into English. “We understand what’s going on and we get that this is important. They have a right to protest. I wish they’d do it peacefully,” he said. De La Cruz hung a sign on his boarded-up door — “Justicia Por Georrge Floyd” — one of scores of pleas emblazoned on Lake Street’s plywood-lined storefronts. Two doors down, Ingebretsen’s offered another: “One Human Family.”",0.0

The 29-year-old Jackson Public Schools teacher organized a protest outside the Mississippi Capitol Monday at noon, but only a few people were there. Reporters and TV crews initially outnumbered the protesters. Hall wanted justice for George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. The police officer has been fired and charged with third-degree murder. Floyd's death has ignited a firestorm of massive protests across the nation. But in the city of Jackson, which Mayor Chokwe Lumumba once pledged to make the ""most radical city on the planet,"" demonstrations have been relatively small. There was a protest Friday at the Capitol with about 20 people. On Sunday, more than 100 people gathered at the Jackson Police Department for a peaceful demonstration. Story continues below the photo gallery. Meanwhile, about 300 people marched in Oxford Saturday night, and at least 200 people protested on Saturday and Sunday in Petal, where the mayor came under fire for social media posts. Both cities are largely white, and both have significantly smaller populations than Jackson. Monday's turnout in Jackson didn't deter Hall, who spoke at length to the reporters and photographers. The only police presence was a Capitol Police Officer who watched the gathering from the steps of the Capitol. When asked why more people hadn't turned out, Hall said Jackson doesn't have the problems of other major cities, noting it has a mostly black police force. ""Our struggle here is different than in other cities,"" Hall said, which leads to a sense of complacency. That caught the attention of Adofo Minka, a 33-year-old attorney in Jackson. As Hall had been talking, Minka and several others came to join the protest. Minka brought up a fatal police shooting in mid-April, when Jackson police shot a man who allegedly tried to attack an officer with a screwdriver. Police brutality is an institutional problem, Minka said, and no amount of black police officers will automatically fix that. ""The black police are no better than the white police,"" Minka said.

Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Warnock/Clarion Ledger) Minka and Hall continued to talk. More people arrived. Some started to film the conversation, which branched into race, class and local government — and how they intersect in Jackson. ""Let me ask you this, Would you rather be policed by all-white police force or all-black police force?"" Hall asked. ""I would rather be policed by nobody,"" Minka replied. Hall said he agreed with Minka that there were problems with the Jackson Police Department, but said Minka wasn't being realistic. ""We got black police officers,"" Hall said. ""Are they perfect? No. Are they great? No. But I would rather deal with JPD than deal with Rankin County who is the real problem. The people out in Madison, we know, is the real problem."" ""They do the same thing,"" Minka said. ""The people here in Jackson, we're not going to stand for police brutality nowhere,"" Hall said. ""They already stand for it,"" Minka said. The pair spoke for about 30 minutes, with other members of the group occasionally joining in.

When asked why more people hadn't turned out, Hall said Jackson doesn't have the problems of other major cities, noting it has a mostly black police force. ""Our struggle here is different than in other cities,"" Hall said, which leads to a sense of complacency. That caught the attention of Adofo Minka, a 33-year-old attorney in Jackson. As Hall had been talking, Minka and several others came to join the protest. Minka brought up a fatal police shooting in mid-April, when Jackson police shot a man who allegedly tried to attack an officer with a screwdriver. Police brutality is an institutional problem, Minka said, and no amount of black police officers will automatically fix that. ""The black police are no better than the white police,"" Minka said. JPD: Man refused to drop screwdriver before officer shot him Adofo Minka, left, speaks as fellow protestors listen while gathered outside the Mississippi State Capitol Building in Jackson, Miss. on Monday afternoon. Participants discussed the power structure in Mississippi as well as the magnitude of protests occurring across the world in the wake of George Floyd's death during his arrest in Minneapolis in late May. Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Warnock/Clarion Ledger) Minka and Hall continued to talk. More people arrived. Some started to film the conversation, which branched into race, class and local government — and how they intersect in Jackson. ""Let me ask you this, Would you rather be policed by all-white police force or all-black police force?"" Hall asked. ""I would rather be policed by nobody,"" Minka replied. Hall said he agreed with Minka that there were problems with the Jackson Police Department, but said Minka wasn't being realistic. ""We got black police officers,"" Hall said. ""Are they perfect? No. Are they great? No. But I would rather deal with JPD than deal with Rankin County who is the real problem. The people out in Madison, we know, is the real problem."" ""They do the same thing,"" Minka said. ""The people here in Jackson, we're not going to stand for police brutality nowhere,"" Hall said. ""They already stand for it,"" Minka said. The pair spoke for about 30 minutes, with other members of the group occasionally joining in. By the time their conversation wrapped up, the crowd had swelled to about 50, some holding signs decrying police brutality. Hall decided it was time to march to the Jackson Police Department. ""No justice,"" he shouted. ""No peace,"" the crowd responded and followed behind him. Gov. Tate Reeves discuss Floyd's death During his Monday afternoon press conference, Gov. Tate Reeves directly addressed death of Floyd, saying he was ""disgusted and dismayed"" by video of his arrest. ""I pray that justice will be done,"" Reeves said. The governor reaffirmed that he would support Mississippian's First Amendment right to protest, but warned against any ""anarchists and antagonists from other parts of the country who seem committed to violence.” He said the state is prepared to defend against anarchists, described as “usually spoiled kids who are privileged enough not to know consequences,” who come to Mississippi to incite violence. Addressing the so-called ""anarchists,"" Reeves said, “I am not threatening, I am promising the full force of our state will be ready and willing to defend our communities. They will not stand back, they will lean in and you will not like the results.” Alissa Zhu contributed to this report.

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

1622843815,2020-06-01 23:53:00,'Hate just hides': Biden vows to take on systematic racism,https://www.wapt.com/article/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/32734216,en,False,,113159,wapt.com,http://wapt.com/,"Advertisement 'Hate just hides': Biden vows to take on systematic racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality.The former vice president offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support.“Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

Advertisement Some police officers are showing solidarity with protesters in several US cities Share Shares Copy Link Copy Americans have been protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police for days on end in dozens of cities throughout the United States.While tensions between police and demonstrators have heated up in many places, some officers have shown solidarity with the movement by hugging protesters, praying with them, mourning with them, and taking a knee to honor Floyd.In Atlanta, Georgia, a line of police officers holding shields during a protest Monday near Centennial Olympic park kneeled in front of demonstrators.In another image, an officer wearing a gas mask, helmet and vest was seen embracing a demonstrator in a hug on the fourth day of protests in the southern city.The Denver Chief of Police Paul Pazen joined in with demonstrators Monday, linking arms with attendees.On Sunday, Pazen said dozens of his officers had been injured while responding to the protests but were eager to return and protect the rights of demonstrators.In New York, Chief of Department of the New York City Police, Terence Monahan, embraced a demonstrator during a protest in his city Monday.On the West Coast, protestor Kevin Welbeck of Cre8 The Change shook hands with a California Highway Patrol officer during a protest in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles.At least two officers in Connecticut joined demonstrators as they marched through Bristol Monday.Bristol Police Officer Nick Travisano was hugged by a protester as he joined a march with fellow officer Chris Bird.In Minnesota, the state where Floyd was killed, an officer and a demonstrator shared an emotional embrace during a protest in St. Paul.

And in Cincinnati, the city's police chief and other officers took a knee Monday in solidarity with protesters. The chief said he was talking with a group of protesters when they asked him to kneel with them.After several nights of protest, Raleigh, North Carolina police showed a simple gesture, taking a knee to show support. Longtime community activist, Dr. Kimberly Muktarian, said it was her idea. She is the president of Save Our Sons and has been working with police and other community advocates for years.""The citizens here in Raleigh have seen tremendous hurt and pain among our black community,"" Muktarian said.

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement FBI to investigate death of black restaurant owner by law enforcement in Louisville Share Shares Copy Link Copy Authorities are investigating the death of a black restaurant owner in Louisville, Kentucky, including FBI Louisville, Kentucky State Police and the U.S. Attorney's Office. David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville. The first few days resulted in heavy damage, vandalism and small fires around the city. Beshear is encouraging peaceful protests moving forward.",0.0

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united.

Biden joined several governors, senators from both parties and two high-level church leaders in deriding President Donald Trump's handling of the protests. In Washington, D.C., protesters were back at the area near the White House where they were dispersed with harsh tactics the day before despite their peaceful behavior. And in Los Angeles -- where police say they have arrested more than 2,700 -- thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Some are demanding the firing of the city's police chief over remarks he made about looting in the nation's second-largest city. A closer look at some recent developments: Six Atlanta police officers are facing charges over an incident caught on video where they are seen using stun guns and forcefully removing two college students from a car. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said an investigation would be launched into the Minneapolis Police Department, which is also facing a civil rights complaint. George Floyd's funeral will be held June 9 in his hometown of Houston. The family accepted an offer from former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. to pay for the funeral services. There will be two memorial services held in Minneapolis and North Carolina before the funeral. Remembering George Floyd:Memorial services, funeral to be held in Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas How to talk to your kids:Floyd. Arbery. Taylor. What do we tell our children? Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Large protest again near White House Crowds in the thousands chanted, ""I can't breathe'' on a fifth day of protests in Washington, D.C., as demonstrators returned to the area near the White House where they were forcefully removed Monday. Law enforcement had used what appeared to be tear gas -- officials later said they were gas canisters -- shields and horses to clear out a group of peaceful demonstrators to make way for President Donald Trump's visit to a nearby church. There, he stood and was photographed holding a Bible. Several thousand protesters were gathered north of Lafayette Square on Tuesday, forced onto an adjacent street by a large, black chain link fence that had been installed overnight around the park. Gone, for the moment, were the confrontational police lines that were so prominent a day before. It wasn't clear how forcefully police would enforce the 7 p.m. ET curfew. L.A. police chief apologizes for remarks amid calls for his firing Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore has apologized and is fending off calls for his firing after likening looters in the city to those responsible for George Floyd's death. ""We didn't have protests last night. We had criminal acts,"" Moore said Monday. ""We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd. We had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands, as much as it is those officers."" Moore tweeted out an apology, saying he misspoke. ""While I did immediately correct myself, I recognize that my initial words were terribly offensive,'' Moore said via Twitter. ""Looting is wrong, but it is not the equivalent of murder and I did not mean to equate the two. I deeply regret and humbly apologize for my characterization.'' Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti was called out on social media, with people demanding that he fire Moore. Later Tuesday, protesters gathered at Garcetti's home. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 protesters made their way for a second day through the streets of Hollywood, and several hundred demonstrated in downtown Los Angeles, at times kneeling en masse and at others calling for Moore's resignation. -- Jordan Culver Mother of Floyd's daughter speaks out about her loss The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter lamented that he'll miss the girl's future milestones, like graduating and getting married, in her first public comments since he died in police custody May 25. From a podium at the city hall in Minneapolis, where Floyd moved from Houston seeking better work opportunities, Roxie Washington said she wanted to speak up for him and their daughter Gianna, who joined her. Washington also said she wants justice for Floyd. “He’ll never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle,'' said Washington, who struggled to fight back tears. ""If there’s a problem she’s had and needs her dad, she does not have that anymore.” -- Mark Emmert Six Atlanta officers charged in incident with college students Six Atlanta police officers seen on video forcefully pulling two young college students out of their car during Saturday protests have been charged, mostly with aggravated assault, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said. Two of the officers, investigators Ivory Streeter and Mark Gardner, were fired Sunday. The incident was caught on body cam video and denounced by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Messiah Young and his girlfriend Taniyah Pilgrim were caught in traffic Saturday night during protests over George Floyd's killing when they were approached by the officers yelling commands. The video shows the officers using stun guns on the couple, breaking the car window with a baton and yanking out both students, who are heard screaming and asking what was happening. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,'' Bottoms said, ""but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.'' Another church leader denounces Trump For the second day in a row, a high-ranking church official has taken issue with President Donald Trump's actions. A day after a much-criticized photo op at a fire-damaged Episcopal church near the White House, Trump took his anti-protester ""law and order"" message to a Catholic shrine Tuesday, a visit that drew swift condemnation from a top church official. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The Trumps posed for photos and stood for a few minutes in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory expressed his disapproval of the presidential visit, saying in a statement: “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Monday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington told CNN she was ""outraged'' that police in riot gear had used tear gas to clear a path across Lafayette Park for Trump and other members of his administration to walk to St. John's Episcopal Church for a photo-op. -- David Jackson, Michael Collins and Nicholas Wu GOP senators criticize Trump: 'Word of God as a political prop' Minnesota files human rights complaint against Minneapolis police The Minnesota Department of Human Rights said it will file a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the death of George Floyd and begin an investigation. According to a news release, the investigation will focus on policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years to ""determine if the MPD has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped."" “Silence is complicity,'' Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. ""Minnesotans can expect our administration to use every tool at our disposal to deconstruct generations of systemic racism in our state.” -- Mark Emmert Biden blasts Trump, urges national unity Former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday invoked George Floyd's last words, ""I can't breathe"" to address the nation's escalating protests and racial tensions. Biden, speaking at Philadelphia City Hall, criticized President Donald Trump's handling of the protests, accusing him of trafficking in ""fear and division."" But he added that problems of racism and social injustice in America go beyond Trump. ""I wish I could say that hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. But it didn't and it won't,"" Biden said. ""American history is not a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending."" Minneapolis officers fire paint ""marking rounds"" to enforce curfew A video shared on social media appears to show Minneapolis law enforcement shooting ""marking rounds"" of green paint at people standing on their front porch last weekend. The video, which was shared by Minneapolis resident Tanya Kerssen on Saturday evening, shows a Humvee and an officer dressed in riot gear passing by her home to enforce curfew. A group of around 15 to 20 police officers and National Guardsmen then approach the front of the house, shouting, ""Go inside!"" five or six times and, ""Get in your house now!"" After around 10 seconds of commands, one officer yells, ""Light 'em up,"" and starts shooting green paint bullets at Kerssen and other unidentified people, according to the video. Neither Kerssen nor the police department immediately responded to a request for comment from USA TODAY. – Joshua Bote New York City gets earlier curfew after night of violence, looting New York City will impose an 8 p.m. curfew for the remainder of the week after violent protests Monday night led to more than 700 arrests. Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed Tuesday to halt looting and violence, saying an 11 p.m. curfew Monday failed to quell the dangerous situation. The looting spread across the boroughs and in midtown Manhattan, where store windows were smashed, goods stolen and fights broke out. ""We saw stuff last night that we will not accept. And we can fight back and we will fight back,"" de Blasio said. – Joseph Spector Truck driver who drove into protesters in Minneapolis released The truck driver who drove into protesters on a Minneapolis interstate over the weekend was released from jail Tuesday, while prosecutors investigate the incident, the Star-Tribune reported. Bogdan Vechirko was jailed Sunday evening on suspicion of assault and held until midday Tuesday in connection with his empty fuel tanker narrowly missing a crowd marching in protest, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement to the Star-Tribune. “Investigators are in the process of gathering additional information and answers to aid in the charging decision,” the statement continued. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington told the newspaper Monday that there was no information that made the incident seem intentional. -- Elinor Aspegren Federal prisons locked down The federal Bureau of Prisons has imposed a national lockdown in a move resembling the agency's response to mass rioting at several facilities 25 years ago. Federal authorities, already struggling to contain deadly outbreaks of the coronavirus that has left 68 inmates dead, had ordered nationwide restrictions on inmate movements in March in an attempt to limit the virus' spread. But officials took the more restrictive action late Monday, citing the sometimes violent protests on the nation's streets. ""In light of extensive protest activity occurring around the country, the BOP – in an abundance of caution – is implementing an additional, temporary security measure to ensure the good order and security of our institutions,"" the bureau said in a statement. – Kevin Johnson TikTok apologizes for #GeorgeFloyd, #BlackLivesMatter glitches TikTok promised to promote diversity on its platform and denied claims the social media service blocked posts featuring hashtags related to the death of George Floyd. TikTok said a technical glitch made it temporarily appear as if posts with the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd received no views. The platform said it was dealing with a display issue, and videos featuring those tags amassed more than 2 billion views. The problem was not ""an intentional act to suppress the experiences and invalidate the emotions felt by the Black community,"" read an apology blog post from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok's general manager, and director of creator community Kudzi Chikumbu. – Brett Molina Music industry, social media go silent for Blackout Tuesday The music industry took a break from business-as-usual to mark Blackout Tuesday to call attention to the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans. Big names in entertainment such as Katy Perry, Kylie Jenner, Kevin Hart and Timothee Chalamet showed their support Tuesday on social media, using the hashtags #blackouttuesday and #theshowmustbepaused to help draw attention to the effort. ""While this is only one day, we are working on ways to actively fight for meaningful, systematic change against the injustices black people continue to face,"" the post from the official @hamiltonmusical Instagram account read. – Gary Dinges What is Blackout Tuesday? The social media trend explained More protest coverage from USA TODAY Protesters in DC take shelter inside resident's home after curfew Dozens of protesters took refuge inside a stranger's home in Washington overnight Monday as police funneled a crowd of demonstrators onto one street after a 7 p.m. citywide curfew. Rahul Dubey told NBC Washington that he acted instinctively when he opened his door to roughly 60 demonstrators near his house around 10 p.m., and allowed them to stay until the curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Reports on social media showed police corralling a group of demonstrators onto one D.C. street as they used pepper spray on the crowd. Dubey told the TV station he was also pepper sprayed. ""The crowd came racing through like a tornado,"" he said. ""We had to keep the door open and keep pulling them in. ... It's the same you would do if there's a storm."" – Ryan W. Miller Man fatally shot, officer critically injured at Las Vegas protests One man was dead and a Las Vegas police officer was on life support Tuesday following a night of angry protests that included two separate shooting incidents. Sheriff Joe Lombardo said officers were attempting to clear protesters throwing rocks and bottles from Las Vegas Boulevard when the officer was shot sometime before midnight. The officer was in ""grave"" condition, Lombardo said. Lombardo said the second incident involved the fatal shooting of an armed man wearing body armor by police and federal agents guarding a federal building in downtown Las Vegas. Lombardo said the man had reached for a firearm. Investigations of both shootings were continuing, Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable,"" Lombardo said. ""I hope the community sees it that way, too."" 4 officers shot in St. Louis, police say Four St. Louis police officers were shot early Tuesday as a peaceful protest devolved into ""mayhem,"" Police Chief John Hayden said. The police department tweeted that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening after the shootings overnight. It was unclear who had fired the shots. Several hundred people rallied peacefully Monday afternoon outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protesters later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire.

Smith is training in Austin as he attends the University of Texas. His family was originally from Bermuda but he moved to the U.S. as a child and has dual citizenship. “You know, I’m 35 and I can recall all these names of all these people who have passed away — Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin — and they’re just ingrained in my brain and I felt like this was a moment that I really wanted to participate in,” Smith said. The Olympics and protests The Olympic Games themselves are no stranger to protests. One of the most famous examples was in the 1968 Olympics when black athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a fist on the podium after medaling in the 200 meter race while the Star Spangled Banner was being played. According to History.com, their raised black-gloved fists represented their “solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world.” They also stood in “black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty, [and wore] beads to protest lynchings.” The third man on the podium was Australian Peter Norman, who didn’t raise his fist but joined them in wearing a badge for the Olympic Project for Human rights All faced intense backlash. The Americans were suspended from the U.S. team and the Australian never competed in the Olympics again despite qualifying multiple times for the Australian Olympic team, History.com said. Dr. John Carlos said you see far more athletes stepping up now in the name of social justice and recently told WDVM’s Marcus Dash, “I sit back and smile with pride and say, ‘They are the fruit of my labor.'” Dr. John Carlos travels the U.S. talking many different kinds of groups. Recently Nexstar station WDVM caught up with him when he went to a high school to talk to student athletes He says he hopes the next generation continues to stand up when they see injustice. “Trying to inspire someone to make them feel confident enough that you can stand for what’s right and you don’t have to stand back and tolerate certain things when you know emotionally, spiritually, it’s affecting you,” Carlos said.",0.0

1623380248,2020-06-02 10:04:03,Violence continues as Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.wjtv.com/news/violence-continues-as-trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide/,en,True,,34507,wjtv.com,http://www.wjtv.com#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after a carefully orchestrated declaration by President Donald Trump to send out the military and “dominate the streets,” American cities were engulfed in more violence and destruction that overshadowed peaceful protests demanding justice after generations of racism. In New York City, largely peaceful demonstrations were punctuated by people smashing storefront windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors to the storied Macy’s store on 34th Street, leaving the major Manhattan thoroughfare littered with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two.

Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day that Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the location where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest began to mount, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. The police chief in Louisville was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by security forces during unrest early Monday.

Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. The latest wave of protests came on the day that Trump portrayed himself as hard-nosed, law-and-order president and police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump emerged after two days out of public view and threatened in remarks from the White House Rose Garden that he would deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. The photo op was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. The nation has been roiled by violence over the death of Floyd for nearly a week. The protests come after years of seeking police reforms over repeated cases of minorities dying in police custody, and at a time when the country is already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, whose officers have made hundreds of arrests. The president, seeking his second term in office, demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos at the historic house of worship. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him.

If you miss the live report, you’ll be able to see a replay minutes after the stream ends. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors Monday, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Officials in Arlington, Virginia, later ordered the county’s police, who were helping with crowd control in Lafayette Square under a mutual aid request from U.S. Park Police, to leave Monday night. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey tweeted that she was “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was “abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op” by Trump. A statement from the county said it was “re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation.

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do. Obviously, they honored the curfew,"" Thomas said. ""Now there are people out who may be attempting to do things similar to what happened last night and the night before.""",0.0

Peaceful protests and violent riots have occurred across America in recent days in response to the death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes during an arrest. While a peaceful protest took place in Oxford over the weekend, no groups had convened in Starkville as of Monday morning. The administrators, coaches and players who call Starkville home, though, have expressed their feelings about the current climate of racial tension in the United States. Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen released a statement on Twitter Saturday night. He wrote that he is having a hard time trying to process the ""senseless loss of lives, racial violence and social injustice"" that continues in the U.S. today. ""I cannot presume to know the pain that the African American community is feeling, but I know it's real,"" Cohen said in the statement. ""Everyone deserves to be treated equally and feel safe."" Cohen wrote that everyone in America must do their part to set into motion a collective change in the way citizens of the country approach the issue of racism. University president Mark Keenum released a statement Sunday, saying racism is a reality that still threatens the country's future. Keenum called on the Mississippi State community to lessen the burdens young African Americans face in trying to become successful members of a society that still seems to be heavily stacked against them. ""I challenge all of us to hold fast to MSU's core values of diversity, inclusion, tolerance, and respect for others and to strive together to assure that those values do not waver or change."" A message from MSU President Mark Keenum pic.twitter.com/9ETttrdap9 — Mississippi State (@msstate) May 31, 2020 'I am in constant prayer for protection over him' Mississippi State football coach Mike Leach tweeted a picture that included a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. Here's what it said: ""People fail to get along because they fear each other; they fear each other because they don't know each other; they don't know each other because they have not communicated with each other."" Softball coach Samantha Ricketts echoed Leach's sentiments in tweeting a list of things everyone can do to sympathize with their peers. She told her followers to have tough conversations with their family and friends and to contact their local politicians to become more educated. Ricketts also encouraged donating to racial justice causes and registering to vote. Women's basketball coach Nikki McCray-Penson tweeted that she woke up Sunday with a ""heavy heart."" She said there is no excuse for racism and violence to still be so prevalent in the world. McCray-Penson said she will fight for and provide endless support for the young women she coaches, every one of whom has a minority ethnic background like McCray-Penson herself. ""As a mom of a young black son, I am in constant prayer for protection over him,"" McCray-Penson said in her tweet. ""Praying to God for healing for our nation and praying for those families for the senseless lives that have been lost."" 'If you're not with US, you're against us' JaMya Mingo-Young, a rising sophomore on McCray-Penson's roster, tweeted about the issue of race Sunday evening. Her remark was much shorter than her coach's but was just as telling and profound. ""If you're not with US, you're against us...."" Mingo-Young said. She ended the tweet with the Black Lives Matter hashtag. Kobe Jones, a rising senior defensive lineman, took a unique approach to the situation on his Twitter account. He prefaced his tweet by saying he normally does not make his political views public because ""there are a lot of fools in this world who confuse righteousness for weakness."" But when he made his argument, he tried to explain why politics should not be the crux of the problem anyway. ""This is not a battle between races. It's a battle between Good and Evil,"" Jones tweeted. ""What is race anyways? Don't be fooled, and don't be scared. The only way this works out is if we work together."" Fellow defensive lineman Nathan Pickering took a similar, shortened stance. Pickering, a sophomore from Seminary, told his Twitter followers that people constantly tell him to ""quit acting white."" ""This world needs to stop looking down at COLOR and start looking up at GOD!"" Pickering tweeted. ""I AM BLACK AND I AM PROUD!!"" Contact Tyler Horka at thorka@gannett.com.

Time Walz said the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on a closed Minneapolis freeway to protest George Floyd's death was apparently confused and didn't mean to injure anyone. State authorities said Monday that the driver of a tanker truck did not intend to hit anyone when he drove onto the Interstate 35W Bridge in Minneapolis and sent protesters running for their lives. Government officials say trucker Bogdan Vechirko may not have realized that I-35W and other metro interstates had been closed as part of the ongoing unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd last week in police detention. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Vechirko, driving an empty fuel tanker truck from Interstate 94 onto northbound 35W, was speeding but did not go around any barricades and was not acting intentionally while narrowly missing everyone in the crowd. As Harrington was making his comments at a midday news conference, Vechirko, 35, of Otsego, remained jailed on suspicion of assault but had not been charged. The driver “panicked, and he just kept barreling forward,” Harrington said. When Vechirko saw a woman on her bike fall in front of him, he slammed on his brakes and came to a sliding stop, the commissioner said. “We don’t have any information that makes this seem like this was an intentional act,” he said. “It wasn’t that he went around the barricades to get to the protest.” People climbed atop the tanker as continued to move after plowing into protesters who had shut down the bridge. Harrington’s conclusion about Vechirko’s motives runs counter to that of several people on the bridge, including Drew Valley, who said, “He wasn’t stopping. He was beeping loudly and driving into a crowd of people. “That’s the same kind of malice that brought us here. It’s a callous disregard for someone’s humanity.” Another marcher, who was nearly hit, said the driver’s actions makes him suspect he meant to keep going but may not have been trying to hit anyone. Charlie Garney said he spotted the truck about 150 yards from where he was standing. Garney said the driver began maneuvering around vehicles ahead of him that were trying to turn around after being unable to cross the bridge. The truck driver “began accelerating from a low speed to a high speed while blaring his horn,” Garney said. “It was clear … he knew we were there and accelerating toward us.” Garney said the truck came within 15 to 20 feet of him on the bridge while going “deeper into the crowd. … I was in fear of my life with no place to go.” Garney acknowledged being uncertain about Vechirko’s motives. “If he did have the intent to kill people, he had a change of heart,” Garney said. Gov. Tim Walz said he watched the incident live on highway cameras, and “I was breathless ... because I thought I was going to witness dozens or hundreds killed.” He also praised the protesters who protected the driver, who was pulled out of the cab when he stopped halfway across the Mississippi River span and attacked. “He got beat up pretty bad,” said Justin Goeman, who came to the driver’s defense until police reached him. “If we hurt this man, it defeats our purpose. ... I cannot imagine what the narrative would be if we hurt that man.” The barriers were meant to be up in time to enforce an 8 p.m. curfew, but the Minnesota Department of Transportation was directed to have its barricades and big trucks in place earlier as 5,000 to 6,000 protesters marched from to the bridge, Harrington said. At least in Minnesota, Vechirko’s driving record is nearly spotless. He was convicted of a seat belt violation in 2009 and has had dismissed one citation for speeding and two for failure to produce proof of insurance. The driver’s employer, Ohio-based Kenan Advantage Group, declined to answer questions about the incident after releasing a statement that said in part: “Our hearts go out to all those who are grieving the events of this past week. … We will be cooperating fully with the investigating authorities in the days ahead.” One motorist said she encountered no barricades blocking traffic onto the bridge moments before the truck sliced through the crowd. Meaghan Pezon was driving north on 35W and saw many cars going the wrong way toward her. “I was confused and knew I should probably turn around, but there was no good place for me to do it,” she said. “My car was surrounded by protesters. When a protester first approached me, there were no police, no barricades, no indication that 35 was closed.” As police swarmed in and protesters dispersed, she exited on an entrance ramp. “I really had no idea what was happening on the bridge,” she said. “I just thought I was going home.” Staff writers Mara Klecker and Matt McKinney contributed to this report.",0.0

Mississippi Clarion Ledger Dhahran Hall made a flyer and a Facebook post, then waited. The 29-year-old Jackson Public Schools teacher organized a protest outside the Mississippi Capitol Monday at noon, but only a few people were there. Reporters and TV crews initially outnumbered the protesters. Hall wanted justice for George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. The police officer has been fired and charged with third-degree murder. Floyd's death has ignited a firestorm of massive protests across the nation. But in the city of Jackson, which Mayor Chokwe Lumumba once pledged to make the ""most radical city on the planet,"" demonstrations have been relatively small. There was a protest Friday at the Capitol with about 20 people. On Sunday, more than 100 people gathered at the Jackson Police Department for a peaceful demonstration. Story continues below the photo gallery. Meanwhile, about 300 people marched in Oxford Saturday night, and at least 200 people protested on Saturday and Sunday in Petal, where the mayor came under fire for social media posts. Both cities are largely white, and both have significantly smaller populations than Jackson. Monday's turnout in Jackson didn't deter Hall, who spoke at length to the reporters and photographers. The only police presence was a Capitol Police Officer who watched the gathering from the steps of the Capitol. When asked why more people hadn't turned out, Hall said Jackson doesn't have the problems of other major cities, noting it has a mostly black police force. ""Our struggle here is different than in other cities,"" Hall said, which leads to a sense of complacency. That caught the attention of Adofo Minka, a 33-year-old attorney in Jackson. As Hall had been talking, Minka and several others came to join the protest. Minka brought up a fatal police shooting in mid-April, when Jackson police shot a man who allegedly tried to attack an officer with a screwdriver. Police brutality is an institutional problem, Minka said, and no amount of black police officers will automatically fix that. ""The black police are no better than the white police,"" Minka said. JPD: Man refused to drop screwdriver before officer shot him Adofo Minka, left, speaks as fellow protestors listen while gathered outside the Mississippi State Capitol Building in Jackson, Miss. on Monday afternoon. Participants discussed the power structure in Mississippi as well as the magnitude of protests occurring across the world in the wake of George Floyd's death during his arrest in Minneapolis in late May. Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Warnock/Clarion Ledger) Minka and Hall continued to talk. More people arrived. Some started to film the conversation, which branched into race, class and local government — and how they intersect in Jackson. ""Let me ask you this, Would you rather be policed by all-white police force or all-black police force?"" Hall asked. ""I would rather be policed by nobody,"" Minka replied. Hall said he agreed with Minka that there were problems with the Jackson Police Department, but said Minka wasn't being realistic. ""We got black police officers,"" Hall said. ""Are they perfect? No. Are they great? No. But I would rather deal with JPD than deal with Rankin County who is the real problem. The people out in Madison, we know, is the real problem."" ""They do the same thing,"" Minka said. ""The people here in Jackson, we're not going to stand for police brutality nowhere,"" Hall said. ""They already stand for it,"" Minka said. The pair spoke for about 30 minutes, with other members of the group occasionally joining in. By the time their conversation wrapped up, the crowd had swelled to about 50, some holding signs decrying police brutality. Hall decided it was time to march to the Jackson Police Department. ""No justice,"" he shouted. ""No peace,"" the crowd responded and followed behind him. Gov. Tate Reeves discuss Floyd's death During his Monday afternoon press conference, Gov. Tate Reeves directly addressed death of Floyd, saying he was ""disgusted and dismayed"" by video of his arrest. ""I pray that justice will be done,"" Reeves said. The governor reaffirmed that he would support Mississippian's First Amendment right to protest, but warned against any ""anarchists and antagonists from other parts of the country who seem committed to violence.” He said the state is prepared to defend against anarchists, described as “usually spoiled kids who are privileged enough not to know consequences,” who come to Mississippi to incite violence. Addressing the so-called ""anarchists,"" Reeves said, “I am not threatening, I am promising the full force of our state will be ready and willing to defend our communities. They will not stand back, they will lean in and you will not like the results.” Alissa Zhu contributed to this report.

The place and the idea. The way it calls to us, and the way the pulse of daily life can sometimes drown it out. My home is near the courthouse square in Oxford, Mississippi, a vibrant modern college community. That’s where we wake up and make scrambled eggs for our toddler. But I’m from a nearby place called Clarksdale, birthplace of the Delta blues, the town that gave the world the likes of Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke, and Nate Dogg—a place where on a clear night I can hear plantation blues, the protest soul of Stax Records, and the heavy sound of G-Funk LA all mix in the open air. View Images The Blue Front, in Bentonia, is across the street from the house where the author’s father grew up. On Friday and Saturday nights, the ghostly music from the guitars inside filtered out of the cinder block bunker through the air and window screens into the dark of the room he shared with his brothers. Photograph by William Widmer, Redux On a recent Saturday afternoon, my wife, Sonia, and I took our two-year-old daughter, Wallace, on a drive into the Delta. The plan was to sit somewhere for a picnic. We’d stop in Clarksdale and pick up some takeout at an old-school Italian roadhouse called Ramon’s, drive out in the country, spread out a blanket, and just be there for a while. Zoom in for more detail.  Clarksdale is 64 miles by car from Oxford, but it feels farther than that. It feels like something out of a novel or a play. In fact, it is. Tennessee Williams grew up in my neighborhood. Two doors to the left of the house where we moved when I was five was a big white mansion. The woman who lived in it was named Blanche. Heading into town, I turned off of the highway and we bumped along a busted country road. We looked out the right window of the car and saw a nearly burned down house, still smoldering. A soot-stained chimney reached into the blue sky. Out the left window, a tall white grave marker sat in the middle of a pecan orchard. The son of a prominent local farmer had recently died of an opioid overdose. I worked for the farmer a long time ago, and he’s a good man, funny and generous. I saw a bench situated next to the grave, and in my mind I could see the outline of the farmer and his wife, year after year, growing old on that bench, watching leaves come and go on the trees. “It’s a town full of ghosts,” Sonia said as we arrived. That’s Clarksdale. The places we haunt We are a nation of ghosts these days. In a strange twist, the places we’re haunting are our own lives. To me right now, the idea of traveling isn’t so much about making new experiences as it is communing with old ones. I think that’s why I wanted takeout from Ramon’s. I texted ahead to place our order. In the late 1800s, Sicilians landed in New Orleans on lemon boats and worked in the sugarcane towns of Louisiana, and in the cotton towns of Mississippi. Open any phone book in the Mississippi Delta and all the vowel-ending names give away a time and a place that has mostly been forgotten. The Italians speak with southern accents now. Beverly Ely runs Ramon’s, after her wonderful husband, Thomas, passed away. Her daughter Scottie, and her granddaughters Meri Hollis and Sara, are in there a lot of the time, too. When I think of what home tastes like, I imagine their fried shrimp, and their red gravy ladled atop tubular cavatuna noodles and veal cutlets. Their veal might be my dying wish. In this time of social distancing, which is just a fancy word for loneliness, I find myself craving it. We pulled up out front and waited. The restaurant is squat and long, with weathered siding and an old faded sign. The original owners wanted to name it Raymond’s. The sign painter messed up and the mistake stuck. Their dining room is closed. Beverly still goes to work and sits behind the low counter in the front room. Scottie says her mom is really struggling with that. Beverly has a reputation as a tough lady, but I think she loves how this little town passes by her counter. On one recent visit, I saw my friend Fred’s parents sitting there with the local parish priest. Scottie talks to her late father a lot when she’s in there alone. The restaurant isn’t her primary source of income but patrolling the dining room in this little joint is her way of paying tribute to her family, of making sure some essential idea about them endures. She likes that there is a community that exists around Ramon’s. And she hopes it can survive, not just this moment, but the inevitable passage of time. The virus is super-charging a fear she always has about what time does to cherished people and places. I think right now Americans are realizing something that people who grew up in towns like Clarksdale have always known: We live in a country that has been blowing away like poorly managed topsoil. This virus isn’t destroying as much as revealing how fragile our way of life has been for generations. View Images There’s a marker where Muddy Waters’ house once stood, in between Stovall Road and one of the cotton fields where he worked. Photograph by Suse Walczak, laif/Redux Legacy of longing Placed on the back seat next to Wallace, the Italian food smelled amazing. I wanted to eat it on the little square of grass where Muddy Waters’ house used to stand. It’s the spot where he sang plantation songs that Alan Lomax and John Work recorded for the Library of Congress. The home is gone now, transplanted to a nearby museum, but when I was in high school, the wreck of it still stood abandoned alongside a cotton field. The road there runs through the old Stovall Plantation, where Muddy Waters worked. It was owned then by Colonel William Howard Stovall, a World War I flying ace who died just six years before I was born. His family still owns it. Not much changes around here. Muddy’s genius was that he took that nostalgia for homeplace music, combined it with his pain and anger at that place, and let it rip—loud, dangerous, and alive. He played this new invented sound in juke joints like Chicago’s Smitty’s Corner or Theresa’s Lounge, to crowds of newly urban country folk like him, many of them in the city to leave behind the same plantation fields he had fled.

After being recorded by Alan Lomax in 1941, Waters went on to a wildly influential career as a musician, pioneering an electric blues style after his move to Chicago. Photograph by Val Wilmer, Getty Images A few miles from Stovall’s, I pulled up to Muddy’s grassy patch on Burnt Cane Road. We spread out the blanket and Wallace sat down, gripped a fried shrimp, and took a bite. She pointed at the clamshell of spaghetti and I twirled up a forkful and she ate it with delight. Sitting there with her, in a place where something used to be, I never felt more strongly connected to my hometown. I grew up serenaded by the lullabies of vanished worlds. By songs of regret and decay. Now I find I crave those feelings. I find myself communing with them, seeking them out, as if the bittersweet in them might inoculate me against future pains and regrets. I’ve been worried the virus might leave a similar inheritance for my daughter. I worry that she, too, might grow up surrounded by stories of places lost, of how things used to be. I wondered if bringing her back here was good or bad, whether to sit tight or run from that spot. I looked at the empty field behind us as we ate, the cotton picked clean and the stalks rolled under in preparation for another cycle. It was getting close to time to plant—if farmers can get crop loans, if the rain will hold off. Wallace started making the noise she makes when she has to go to the bathroom. “Home,” she said with urgency. We laughed and started to gather up our things. “Home,” she said.

But home is home—and in the blues, you can hear the promise that, though you struggle, you will emerge and survive. Photograph by Andrea Morales Country blues I put on some Muddy Waters for the drive back. That glorious noise he invented rarely made it on to his recordings thanks to commercial-conscious record-label men who’d softened him. But seven years before he died, he finally laid it down on “Hard Again,” recorded on Blue Sky Records in 1976. In the beginning of the first tune, his voice is accompanied by a single slide guitar. Everything he had overcome in his life lives inside his cry, at once wounded and defiant. The band slides into gear, the younger musicians confronted with something they’d read about in books but never truly experienced, as if it weren’t 1976 any longer but the end of the Depression, as if they were standing in cotton fields surrounded by gnarled trees along Stovall Road. Muddy is speaking from the soul of a tractor driver and guitar picker and moonshine runner whose first memories of Alan Lomax included shock that a white man would share a water cup with him. I’ve been thinking recently about how these specific blues could be the soundtrack for a country trying to emerge from quarantine in one piece. A friend I trust told me that sentiment sounds like a kumbaya, and I know what he means. There is real pain and irreducible violence in the music. It records a very particular history. View Images People dance at a juke joint—an informal gathering place for music, booze, and dancing—circa 1940 near Clarksdale. During his time working on a sharecropped plantation as a young man, Muddy Waters turned his home into a juke joint on weekends. Photograph by Michael Ochs Archive, Getty Images But I think I also know the grace in Muddy’s music is that he has given it to everyone, even the descendants of his oppressors. That makes me hopeful. Whatever gets rolled under the wheel can be reborn; home is an idea and if the idea lives, then home lives, too, no matter what individual pieces of it slip through our hands. The human spirit is in flight not only when it triumphs, but when it struggles and strives. That’s the message in the empty spaces between Muddy’s band and his voice. You cannot miss it. He’s an older man talking to his younger self, singing to him, and sometimes laying back and letting those guitar strings ring out like a church bell calling to worship, letting him know he will struggle, yes, but he will emerge and survive. At the end of the track, the band hollers with delight. You can hear it on the record—Muddy hops around the studio, on fire, reborn. We listened to it the whole way home. View Images Downtown Clarksdale sometimes feels vibrant and sometimes feels like a shadow of its former self. Even its attempt at reinvention as a blues destination is built on the seductive and nostalgic idea that here lies a dying town that was once capital of a dying world.

Innocent citizens under siege. Outside actors engaging in terrorist acts. Police struggling to maintain control and in desperate need of reinforcements. That was how Chinese state media portrayed anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, dismissing calls for greater democracy and an investigation into police brutality by focusing on individual acts of violence and property damage. Throughout the protests, the US was consistent in its support of people's right to take to the streets and have their voice heard. Facing widespread unrest and public anger at home in the wake of the death of George Floyd, the reaction from US President Donald Trump appeared markedly different. On Monday, Trump called for the military to be deployed to ""dominate"" protesters, and demanded states do more to stem ""acts of domestic terror."" The irony has not been lost on Beijing, which on Thursday marks (or rather doesn't, the date is highly censored) its own military crackdown on anti-government protesters on June 4, 1989. ""Washington's promise of equality and justice for all in the country has remained hollow at best,"" state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary titled ""The coming suffocation of the American dream."" ""Amid the ongoing anti-racism protests in the country, decision-makers in Washington, instead of trying to sooth the pain and anger of the public, have been fanning the flames, calling protesters 'THUGS,' and threatening them with 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons,"" the commentary said. China Daily, a state-backed newspaper, noted that ""The US, after the killing of Floyd, seems to be on fire, and troops have been mobilized to subdue angry demonstrators."" ""This is certainly not what the world expects to see in a country that is the world's sole superpower,"" it added. ""But that sadly is the reality of the US."" This rhetoric isn't just embarrassing for Washington, it's also a sign of how the US may find its influence damaged by a perceived hypocrisy over human rights at home and abroad. Earlier today, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam pointed to the unrest in the US as evidence of Washington's ""double standards."" ""They attach great importance to the national security of their country, but look at our national security through tinted spectacles, especially the current situation in Hong Kong,"" she added. The ability of Washington to influence Beijing's position on Hong Kong -- which is in part founded on fear of outside influence in the city -- was already severely limited. The Trump administration's reaction to protests at home may have hurt its position even further.",0.0

The Olympics and protests The Olympic Games themselves are no stranger to protests. One of the most famous examples was in the 1968 Olympics when black athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a fist on the podium after medaling in the 200 meter race while the Star Spangled Banner was being played. According to History.com, their raised black-gloved fists represented their “solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world.” They also stood in “black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty, [and wore] beads to protest lynchings.” The third man on the podium was Australian Peter Norman, who didn’t raise his fist but joined them in wearing a badge for the Olympic Project for Human rights All faced intense backlash.

In New York City, largely peaceful demonstrations were punctuated by people smashing storefront windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors to the storied Macy’s store on 34th Street, leaving the major Manhattan thoroughfare littered with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two.

Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day that Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the location where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest began to mount, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb.

Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. The latest wave of protests came on the day that Trump portrayed himself as hard-nosed, law-and-order president and police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump emerged after two days out of public view and threatened in remarks from the White House Rose Garden that he would deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. The photo op was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. The nation has been roiled by violence over the death of Floyd for nearly a week. The protests come after years of seeking police reforms over repeated cases of minorities dying in police custody, and at a time when the country is already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, whose officers have made hundreds of arrests. The president, seeking his second term in office, demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos at the historic house of worship. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him.

If you miss the live report, you’ll be able to see a replay minutes after the stream ends. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors Monday, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Officials in Arlington, Virginia, later ordered the county’s police, who were helping with crowd control in Lafayette Square under a mutual aid request from U.S. Park Police, to leave Monday night. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey tweeted that she was “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was “abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op” by Trump. A statement from the county said it was “re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

Advertisement Police take a knee, drawing cheers, support from protesters in Fort Worth, Texas Share Shares Copy Link Copy Despite some tense moments during protests in Fort Worth, Texas, officers and the police chief drew praise when they kneeled with protesters to show support.Protesters there voiced concerns once again Monday night, drawing attention to deaths of black people by police officers. But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

(AP) — Protesters marched in Mississippi's capital city on Monday, with some stopping to lie on the ground outside Jackson's main police station to remember George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes. Other protests took place during the weekend in Oxford, Biloxi, Jackson and other parts of Mississippi. There were no reports of violence. Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he respects people's First Amendment right to protest. He said he differentiates between those who are protesting to air grievances and “anarchists and agitators from other parts of the country who seem committed to violence."" “We’ve seen them all over the country in the last few days and frankly, they’re usually spoiled kids who are privileged enough to not know the consequences and they tend to co-op otherwise protests that are nonviolent,” Reeves said. “I want you to hear that there is no place for the anarchists and there is no place for the antagonists here in Mississippi."" He said any efforts to cause violence “will be overwhelmed.” “I am not threatening,” Reeves said. ""I am promising that the full force of our state will be ready and willing to defend our communities.” Reeves acknowledged hearing protesters outside the Governor's Mansion during the weekend. “I heard their message,” Reeves said. “I watched in a manner that was forceful without descending into violence.” The Jackson suburb of Pearl said on social media Monday that it was temporarily closing an outlet mall because of the possibility of protests and warned of the continuing coronavirus pandemic. In Oxford on Monday, a judge set bond for a man charged with defacing a Confederate monument at the University of Mississippi during nationwide protests against police brutality. A judge ruled that Zachary Borenstein, 38, could be released on $5,000 bail, The Oxford Eagle reported. Borenstein is a graduate of the university. He was arrested Saturday after the rebel memorial was damaged with spray paint that said “spiritual genocide” and red hand prints. He faces a felony charge of defacing public property. Critics contend the memorial near the main administrative building sends a signal that the university glorifies the Confederacy and glosses over the South’s history of slavery. Confederate memorials and monuments have been targeted elsewhere during protests against police killings. Installed in 1906 during a period when Confederate descendants and sympathizers were erecting monuments to the “lost cause” of the South, the statue was a rallying point in 1962 for people who rioted to oppose the university’s court-ordered integration. Arielle Hudson, the university’s first African American woman Rhodes Scholar, created a fund to cover’s Borenstein’s bail money. She was one of the main leaders of a movement to relocate the statue from its current location. The state College Board has delayed acting on recommendations that the statue be moved to a secluded part of campus, where some Civil War soldiers are buried. University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce issued a statement after Borenstein's arrest condemning racism and saying he is committed to moving the statue, The Daily Mississippian reported. “That monument has divided this campus, and the process of its removal from the Circle is one I am committed to seeing through to completion,"" Boyce said. ""There is more to do, but this needs to happen.”",0.0

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) Warning: Social media embeds may contain profanity WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.

He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. After some people broke into a Zara on Broadway lots of police arrived, by car, bike, on foot. pic.twitter.com/B2UWZ5hLfR — Jan Ransom (@Jan_Ransom) June 3, 2020 “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd.

Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

Ricky Ball, 26, was shot to death during a police traffic stop in October 2015. Columbus Police Department officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was later fired and pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges brought by the state in 2016. As tens of thousands protest inequities in the criminal justice system and the police killings of black Americans, Fitch announced last week that her office had dropped the charges against Boykin. In a two-sentence statement, Fitch’s office said its review of the evidence concluded Boykin had acted in self-defense. “The Attorney General’s Office did a thorough and independent review of the thousands of documents in this case file and concluded that there is not evidence on which to prosecute the case against Officer Boykin,” the statement read. “In fact, all evidence, including forensics and the sworn statements of four separate MBI investigators, points to necessary self-defense.” Fitch’s office did not answer questions asking to elaborate on the findings or about the timing of the decision, as protests continue nationwide in response to the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minnesota involving current or former law enforcement. “It was not something that I expected to happen,” said CPD Chief Fred Shelton of the case’s dismissal. “They just thought (releasing) two paragraphs, we’re dismissing it, that’s all we need to do. That to me was kind of a slap in the face,” added Colom. About 250 demonstrators gathered at Leigh Mall in Columbus on Saturday to protest the decision, the Commercial Dispatch reported. Colom said he plans to request the evidence used in the finding, which he expects to get back in the next 10 days. After his election in 2016, Colom said, he had conversations with then Democratic AG Jim Hood’s office about making sure the case was independent of any local influence. Fitch, a Republican, replaced Hood in last year’s statewide elections and became the first Republican elected to the statewide seat since Reconstruction. Colom called the dismissal’s timing a “gut punch,” emphasizing that there were no deadlines and the officer was out on bond, and there was little to no ability to hold a trial right now due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “We need to put the information out there in the public so people can know what happened in this case because there are a lot of unanswered questions,” he said. “There are a lot of people (wondering), what happened? How did you make the decision to dismiss this case after four years and you’ve only had it for four, five months?” He said any next steps in the case depend on if the charges were dismissed with or without prejudice. Colom also noted the importance of accessing footage in any officer-involved shooting. Boykin and the other officers on the scene during Ball’s death were wearing body cameras but did not turn them on. “If you look at what happened in Minnesota, if you look at what happened in Georgia, without the video, we only get one version of events,” Colom said. Shelton said new policies and structure in the department have improved accountability of officers. After Ball’s death, CPD enacted stricter penalties for officers who do not turn on their cameras during public interactions, including suspension and termination, and since have had no such issues, Shelton said. The department also now has an oversight committee to receive complaints about excessive use of force. Shelton said he is meeting with Colom’s office this week to plan a public forum that will both be used to discuss the use of force and racial profiling, and then to institute new training policies for police officers. “We’re continuing to build and foster the trust we that we have in the community,” he said.",0.0

No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency.

Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt.

THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE NATI Advertisement Young people organize weekend rally in Jackson Share Shares Copy Link Copy There will be more protests in the metro in response to George Floyd's death.The planning is underway for a Saturday march in Jackson. Among other things, there will be a call for an end to police brutality and recognition that black lives matter.Similar to the civil rights era, the demonstration is being organized completely by young people.American cities from coast to coast have seen protests of outrage and anger over Floyd’s death during his arrest by Minneapolis police officers. The officer who was seen on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck has been fired and charged with murder.“It takes so much more to organize than I could've anticipated,” said Calvert White, co-organizer of Saturday’s march.White and Maisie Brown, with Black Lives Matter Mississippi, are the lead organizers of Saturday’s protest and march outside the governor’s mansion.Gov. Tate Reeves said he supports the right to protest but stressed that violence will not be tolerated by law enforcement.“They will never stand back. They will lean in and you will not like the results,” Reeves said earlier this week.“I don't think Tate Reeves, or any white person, can tell us what's an acceptable form of protest and what's not,” Brown said.Brown said there are safety precautions in place, so if agitators show up, they won’t steal the narrative and purpose of the protest. The organizers said they have been in communication with city leaders, including Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and police officials and have been promised their freedom of assembly will not be blocked.The young people and others involved in the movement for change are admonishing those taking to social media to disparage what’s happening at this moment in the country.“You are blind, and for you to snub it with all lives matter is frankly disrespectful. Because we're not saying that other lives don't matter, but we're saying that black lives matter,” White said.Brown and White said that those who can donation face masks and beverages for the rally can do so from noon to 2 p.m. at Mississippi Votes, 510 George Street.Demonstrators are asked to gather at 3 p.m. Saturday. The rally will go on rain or shine, the organizers said.",0.0

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0
1623854887,2020-06-02 20:08:23,Residents continue to protest against Petal Mayor Marx during Tuesday board meeting,https://www.hubcityspokes.com/front-page-slideshow/residents-continue-protest-against-petal-mayor-marx-during-tuesday-board,en,False,"blacks, mayors",661661,Hub City Spokes,http://www.hubcityspokes.com/,"Concerned citizens crammed into Petal City Hall Tuesday night to demonstrate against Mayor Hal Marx and his recent social media comments regarding the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. During the Board of Aldermen’s regular monthly meeting, aldermen moved quickly through their routine agenda and opened up a time of public comment. Numerous citizens – including many from Petal – took three minutes each to speak out against Marx, and most urged the mayor to resign. One Petal citizen, who claimed to be a longtime enemy of Marx’s, defended the mayor, saying Marx made a “bone-headed comment” but that “the mayor didn’t have a racist bone in his body.” Another citizen – who said he was from Forrest County – said he didn’t care if Marx was a racist, but he cared about the impact of the mayor’s statements on the area as a whole. “Your statement offended the county, the city, the state, the people,” the citizen added. “You spoke for everyone, and you brought negativity to everyone. I hate your cockiness.” The citizen, who said he protests daily in front of Marx’s house, said he will continue his peaceful demonstrations. “I will continue to apply pressure to you,” he said. “I’m not out to get you or your family, but it’s you and I, Mr. Marx ... you’ll see a lot of me.” A recent Petal High School graduate also spoke before Marx and the aldermen. “Your words and choices have truly hurt our community and Petal as a city,” he said. “Mistakes have consequences, and you need to face those consequences. People have asked you to step down, and you refuse.” Floyd died during the May 25 encounter with police, which occurred after a grocery store employee called authorities alleging Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. In a video uploaded to social media and widely shared, Floyd can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back while a white officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Floyd complains that he can’t breathe, and the video ends with paramedics lifting his limp body onto a stretcher and into an ambulance. Chauvin was fired and has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. On May 26, Marx posted to his personal Facebook page that “If you can talk you can breathe,” and added “Think about that before you rush to judgment.” He added the hashtag “thinblueline,” a popular saying in support of law enforcement officers. The mayor added to his comments in a Twitter reply later that day, saying he “…didn’t see anything unreasonable” with the incident and speculating that Floyd “…died of an overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified.” The mayor is known for his controversial remarks on Facebook and Twitter. A Facebook user submitted some of Marx’s past comments to The PineBelt NEWS, including his remarks that “Justice was done for George Zimmerman” in 2013. Zimmerman was acquitted for the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black high school student, and the case sparked significant media coverage and national protests. Marx’s personal Facebook page is now set to private, and his Twitter page has been deleted. On May 27, the Petal Board of Aldermen released a letter on the Petal city Facebook page saying Marx’s comments “…are not representative of all of our city leaders. We understand the frustrations his statements have caused.” The statement added that Marx’s comments “are his personal views” and “he has the right to share those views on his personal page.” The aldermen ended the remarks by saying they were “saddened” by the recent events and that the city has “fine police officers who are properly trained and do a great job of keeping us all safe.” In a special-called meeting on May 28, aldermen unanimously asked for Marx’s resignation, and they agreed to censure him. Aldermen also discussed cutting Marx’s salary and limiting his authority, but they tabled the pay cut motion until receiving an opinion from the Mississippi attorney general’s office. “I have done nothing worthy of resigning,” said Marx in an exclusive interview with The PineBelt NEWS. “Maybe I didn’t articulate my thoughts in a way I should have, but they had nothing to do with race or racism.” Three days of protests over Marx’s comments were held at City Hall beginning Friday. The protests were largely peaceful and drew large crowds, including more than 200 people on Saturday. Marx was elected the sixth mayor of Petal in May 2009. He announced in September 2019 that he would not seek re-election to his office in 2021.",0.0

No,https://www.ddtonline.com/columns/protest-yes-riot-no,en,False,"police, crime and criminals",203159,ddtonline.com,http://ddtonline.com/,"Eight minutes and 46 seconds was the amount of time it took for people to stop talking about COVID-19. The terrible death of George Floyd on Memorial Day has sparked a passion and furious outcry from people seeking justice. I haven’t had the stomach to watch the video of former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin press his knee into Floyd’s neck, but I’ve seen several pictures. Even they are difficult to take in. Eight minutes and 46 seconds. In those agonizing minutes, Floyd called out for help. He said he couldn’t breathe. He even called out for his mother. The cop refused to resist. Floyd, who was accused of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, should not have taken his last breaths under a cop’s knee. It was a despicable act by Chauvin and the three other officers involved. People should be mad. What happened to Floyd was not justice, not even close. My brother, who happens to be a police officer, shared his disgust of the events that took place May 25. Officers are not trained to pin someone down by their neck because they know it can lead to devastating results. My brother has arrested several people in his time as a cop, but he has never resorted to the senseless tactics these officers used. Police are trained on ways to safely handle suspects in dangerous situations, let alone something as simple as the suspicion of someone using counterfeit money. Floyd’s arrest should have taken a matter of seconds, but that didn’t happen. In those eight minutes and 46 seconds, he died. I understand why people are protesting. Police brutality is nothing new and it never stops being horrific. People, especially in the African-American community, are exhausted. It is infuriating when you hear stories like the death of Ahmaud Arbery, the unarmed black man in Georgia who was attacked by two white men, Gregory and Travis McMichael, for being a suspected burglar. Arbery was shot and killed Feb. 23 and the McMichaels were not arrested until nearly two months later on May 7, shortly after the video of his murder went viral. It seems fairly obvious why no charges had been filed by the local district attorney’s office on the two men. Gregory is a former investigator with the Brunswick district attorney’s office. The police and prosecutors originally in charge of the case said that there was “insufficient probable cause” for arresting the killers and that Travis was “allowed to use deadly force to protect himself.” Is hunting down and killing a man for suspicion of theft considered justice? To people watching the news, it certainly seems so if you’re friends with the law. It is gut-wrenching to see the shared images of white men arrested after committing mass shootings being handled with a gentle escort to a police cruiser while harmless men like Floyd are pinned to the ground like wild animals and wind up dead. Yes, there are plenty of good cops in the world, my brother being one of them. Yes, the McMichaels were ultimately arrested. Yes, the four officers involved in Floyd’s death were fired and Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But if it weren’t for these videos going viral, would the same end result have occurred? Hard to say. So, yes, people are outraged. They have had enough. During Chauvin’s 18 years with the Minneapolis Police Department, he had 18 complaints and two letters of reprimand filed against him. Was his department going to continue allowing him to be an officer to receive more complaints and reprimands? Now is the time for the good cops to no longer sit back and watch when they see a fellow officer abusing their power. It is incumbent on the good officers to root out the bad ones. For those protesting, please continue practicing your right to do so. Don’t get caught up in the hysteria if someone starts to violently riot and loot businesses at random. Don’t burn down buildings in your community as they have done in other cities. Sunday night, I was watching a live video being taken by a reporter with The Daily Caller in Washington D.C. What started as a peaceful protest turned into randomly shattering windows and breaking into shops to steal the items from inside. As one coffee shop was being broken into, there was a male protestor shouting, “That’s not what we’re here for! That’s not what we’re here for!” He was right. Destruction was not what the protesters went there for, but it didn’t take long for people to forget their cause and go into a barbaric rage once they saw a few agitators sparking the violence. People have a right to be angry. People have a right to protest. People do not, however, have the right to cause more harm because of someone else’s crime. We can and must be better than that. Sadly, there is nothing that will bring Floyd back to his family, but I can’t imagine he would want to see more innocent people being hurt and killed in his name. His own family has publicly spoken out and asked that the violent protests come to an end. There have been peaceful protests throughout the nation as well and they are to be commended. I have seen several images of officers hugging and walking alongside the peaceful protesters. There are many people who want to see a better world and a better way of living together. I have held my children a little closer these past few days. They are pure and innocent with no idea of what’s going on in the world around them. I want them to be raised in a more accepting place than the one we currently live in. A better life is possible, but we have to stand together. If we don’t, it will lead to our falling and we will be left with nothing. Let’s build the world for our children we want for ourselves. Catherine Kirk is managing editor of the Delta Democrat-Times.

Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. SEATTLE — Leaders in Seattle seeking to address concerns raised by protesters have abruptly ended a city-wide curfew in place for days amid massive demonstrations against the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota.Mayor Jenny Durkan said Wednesday evening on Twitter that she was ending the curfew, which had been scheduled to last until Saturday, after she and Police Chief Carmen Best met with community members.“Chief Best believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew,” Durkan said. “For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate. We want you to continue making your voice heard.”Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear.Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course.“Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted.WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it.Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd. Barricades were put up around the Capitol, and the Capitol Police stood guard behind them.“We came here because they make laws here and we want the laws to change,” said Mohammed Wagdy, 26, of nearby Prince George’s County.As an 11 p.m. curfew in Washington neared, community activists urged the demonstrators to head home. Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. Minneapolis — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, was released Wednesday and provides several clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19.The 20-page report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide.The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody. Thomas Lane and Tou Thao both were processed into the Hennepin County jail around 5 p.m. local time Wednesday, according to jail records.Former officer J.

Please be aware of the danger. Stand down!” the Richmond Police Department (RPD) tweeted.The other three former police officers involved in the encounter that led to the death of George Floyd have now been charged, according to Minnesota court records.J.

Memorial Day is a chance to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives by defending our freedom from tyranny. Sometimes, then, it is hard to believe just how upside down our lives have become. Just since coming to Magee in 1992 we have experienced 9-11, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, as well as a host of natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. I lost a family member in that one. Now we are experiencing a global pandemic--never saw that one coming. Our system is out of whack along with a lot of our basic beliefs. Who would have ever thought that worshiping God would be considered offensive and that one of our basic rights, freedom of religion, would be called into question? But prayer has been halted in sponsored outings like high school athletics, and if what you are saying is offensive to anyone else you must cease. Some even want other languages to be equal to English in importance in this country, but we believe that English should be the primary language in the United States. Some other changes are necessary to restore basic American freedoms and our unique way of life. We believe that if you are receiving government assistance, you should be subject to drug testing before you receive benefits. Why should we not identify ourselves before we can vote? We have to do that to perform many other transactions. This is not an effort to disenfranchise anyone, it is to forestall the corruption that will result from an unidentified electorate. Now our nation is hostage to looters because of the recent unfortunate death of George Floyd. I may be mis-informed, but I think the family is calling for a stop to the violence, which does nothing to “honor” their lost loved one. A news report on Tuesday said that the so-called anti-fascist group Antifa got involved with the rioting over Floyd’s death. They come in, stir up the crowds to violence, then pack up and leave on their merry way. Destroyed communities are left with no infrastructure. So while trying to come back from the pandemic these communities have to fight off looters and put out fires. Makes no sense. I believe in peaceful demonstration. If what we know is the truth of the situation, the police officers involved in Floyd’s death need to be charged, but not at the demand of vigilante crowds. That is not justice. We need to do the right thing for the right reason for everyone. If we do not get out of this racial path we are heading down, even we in this usually quiet state will be faced with a much more serious situation of Mississippi Burning.",0.0

(Photo: Barbara Gauntt/Clarion Ledger) Elsewhere in the country, protests have spiraled into violence and led to the destruction of property in major cities such as Minneapolis; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Louisville, Kentucky. Closer to home, protests in Birmingham, Alabama, resulted in shattered windows and other property damage in the downtown area. So far, that hasn’t happened in Jackson or in any other city where protests have occurred in Mississippi, including Biloxi, Oxford and Petal, although a Confederate monument on the campus of the University of Mississippi was vandalized Saturday. Protest at the state Capitol: George Floyd protest at Mississippi Capitol But given nationwide unrest, that could change in a second. Davis, when asked by City Council members at a Tuesday meeting, said he is in close contact with representatives from the state’s Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to monitor protests throughout the city and metro region. He said his department is approaching protests deliberately and also keeping an eye on outside groups that might not have the city's best interest in mind. Avoiding the 'intimidation' of police presence The chief said Jackson police so far are taking a hands-off approach to protests, allowing demonstrators to express their First Amendment rights without the “intimidation"" of a police presence. Officers are purposely directed to keep a distance from protests unless a disturbance occurs. All police patrol officers have riot gear in their cruisers but have been instructed to keep the equipment out of sight unless absolutely necessary. Jackson Police Chief James E. Davis (Photo: Harold Gater) Davis said so far that has worked to not inflame emotions. ""Putting the presence of armed lawmen agitates them,"" Davis told City Council members. ""And so far we've been very successful. We allow the protests to run its course. They peacefully do it and peacefully move on,"" he said. 'Outside agitators' Another factor has played a role so far. Or more accurately, it's absence, according to Davis and several council members. Davis said “outside agitators” who deliberately undermine peaceful protests are largely responsible for problems in other cities. It is a charge that has been levied by several governors and leaders in cities where violence and destruction of property has been prevalent. Those cases are more difficult to identify, the chief said, since many people wear masks. Protesters demand mayor step down: Protesters gather Sunday for 3rd day at Petal City Hall calling for mayor's resignation Civil rights community keeping 'agitators' at bay Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, added another reason the city has not hadthe violent protests seen elsewhere.

""We know how to protest and handle things peacefully. Because of our long history of activism, we would be able to identify and control outside agitators,"" she said.

He said as a former student he had looked up to Marx. ""But we need you to step down, sir,"" he said. Mississippi law: Here's why a mayor can't be ousted for tweet about George Floyd's death Lorraine Bates of Petal, who has been walking in chains to City Hall every day even after the organized protests were over, asked if she would be safe outside City Hall when she protests. ""I'm going to keep protesting,"" she said. ""As long as I have health I am going to protest. I want to know if I am going to be safe."" Anthony Dunn, who has been protesting outside the mayor's home, apologized for making Marx's wife and family uncomfortable, but he vowed to continue to put pressure on the mayor until he resigns. ""I don't know if you're a racist and I don't care if you're a racist,"" Dunn said. ""I'm not here to judge you. What I am concerned about was you didn't have the man in you to apologize and state that you do not speak for these people."" George Floyd protests: How did we get here? The meeting followed three days of protests and a special meeting by the Board of Aldermen asking Marx to step down. A petition on change.org calling for the mayor’s resignation had more than 18,000 signatures by Tuesday evening. Petal has a population of around 11,000.

Mississippi Clarion Ledger Jackson Police Chief James Davis explained to city leaders why he believes protests so far in the state’s capital city have been peaceful compared to others across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death. There have been sporadic rallies at the state Capitol, next to the Governor's Mansion and in front of city institutions since Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25. Another protest is scheduled for Saturday in front of the Capitol.

(Photo: Barbara Gauntt/Clarion Ledger) Elsewhere in the country, protests have spiraled into violence and led to the destruction of property in major cities such as Minneapolis; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Louisville, Kentucky. Closer to home, protests in Birmingham, Alabama, resulted in shattered windows and other property damage in the downtown area. So far, that hasn’t happened in Jackson or in any other city where protests have occurred in Mississippi, including Biloxi, Oxford and Petal, although a Confederate monument on the campus of the University of Mississippi was vandalized Saturday. Protest at the state Capitol: George Floyd protest at Mississippi Capitol But given nationwide unrest, that could change in a second. Davis, when asked by City Council members at a Tuesday meeting, said he is in close contact with representatives from the state’s Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to monitor protests throughout the city and metro region. He said his department is approaching protests deliberately and also keeping an eye on outside groups that might not have the city's best interest in mind. Avoiding the 'intimidation' of police presence The chief said Jackson police so far are taking a hands-off approach to protests, allowing demonstrators to express their First Amendment rights without the “intimidation"" of a police presence. Officers are purposely directed to keep a distance from protests unless a disturbance occurs. All police patrol officers have riot gear in their cruisers but have been instructed to keep the equipment out of sight unless absolutely necessary. Jackson Police Chief James E. Davis (Photo: Harold Gater) Davis said so far that has worked to not inflame emotions. ""Putting the presence of armed lawmen agitates them,"" Davis told City Council members. ""And so far we've been very successful. We allow the protests to run its course. They peacefully do it and peacefully move on,"" he said. 'Outside agitators' Another factor has played a role so far. Or more accurately, it's absence, according to Davis and several council members. Davis said “outside agitators” who deliberately undermine peaceful protests are largely responsible for problems in other cities. It is a charge that has been levied by several governors and leaders in cities where violence and destruction of property has been prevalent. Those cases are more difficult to identify, the chief said, since many people wear masks. Protesters demand mayor step down: Protesters gather Sunday for 3rd day at Petal City Hall calling for mayor's resignation Civil rights community keeping 'agitators' at bay Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, added another reason the city has not hadthe violent protests seen elsewhere. She credited veteran civil rights leaders in Jackson for being able to help monitor whether protesters are engaged in ""non-violent"" or ""non-peaceful"" demonstrations. ""Protesters have a right to protest peacefully without an intimidating police presence and we are aware of outside agitators who come in and hijack protests,"" Omari said. ""We know how to protest and handle things peacefully. Because of our long history of activism, we would be able to identify and control outside agitators,"" she said.
