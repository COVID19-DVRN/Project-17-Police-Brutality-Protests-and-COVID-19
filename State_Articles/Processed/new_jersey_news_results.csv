1616145587,2020-05-25 04:38:28,NJ police forces add UV light to sanitizing toolkit for COVID-19,https://nj1015.com/nj-police-forces-add-uv-light-to-sanitizing-toolkit-for-covid-19/,en,False,,310813,newjersey.statenews.net,http://newjersey.statenews.net/,"Police forces in New Jersey are among those adding the power of special, ultraviolet lights to their germ-busting arsenal during the pandemic. Earlier this month, Linden Police used a $6,000 donation to purchase a portable UV-C generator. The Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery pledged the money toward costs associated with COVID-19 emergency response. Specially trained officers regularly use the light to sanitize police vehicles and other common areas and to allow for extended use of certain Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), according to Linden Police. In Camden County, ultraviolet light systems were given at the beginning of May to Camden County Police and Cooper University Health Care along with other public safety agencies. As described in a county press release, the UV-C lights ""emit electromagnetic radiation that breaks apart and kills microbials like the virus that causes COVID-19 and can be used to decontaminate emergency vehicles."" ""Although there are no specific studies to date evaluating the UV inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), the antimicrobial potential of UVC light has long been established,"" according to the NJ COVID-19 website. The state resource noted ""conventional UVC light had the potential to cause cancer and cataracts, but that work has been underway to develop ""far-UVC light wands or other devices for more widespread use to inactivate microorganisms without posing harm to human skin."" It's a method that's already been in practice at hospitals and medical centers even before the COVID-19 health crisis. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton added a UVC disinfection robot to its facility in March 2019. As reported previously by Robotics Business Review, the Tru-D, “Total Room ultraviolet disinfection,” uses an automated, measured dose of UVC light to consistently disinfect an entire room during one cycle. In 2017, Hunterdon Medical Center put its first Xenex LightStrike Germ-Zapping Robot into place, using ultraviolet light to reduce hospital infections, and a similar device has been used at Overlook Medical Center since 2016. At the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, as of a year ago, each floor had a movable, six-foot-tall UV light device, as Penn Medicine regional director of Operations and Environmental Services Steve Gaynes called the added layer of protection ""a real saver of lives,” according to a University of Pennsylvania article. As the rapid spread of coronavirus first put stress on the supply of PPE, CBS New York reported hospitals within the Atlantic Health System Network, including Morristown Medical Center, added such ultraviolet light machines to efforts to sterilize and preserve masks. “This technology allows our police, EMTs and firefighters to safely decontaminate their vehicles on a regular basis, keeping themselves and our residents safe as they perform the critical function of responding to emergencies during this pandemic,” Camden County Freeholder Jonathan Young said. Young continued “These lamps do not replace routine cleaning or the need for protective equipment, but they give us an additional means of attacking this virus in areas where vulnerable residents might be exposed.” “Having this resource nearby means that we can have our cruisers and SUVs safe for occupancy in a fraction of the time that it would take otherwise,” Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in the same release. Across the Hudson River, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) also is using UV disinfection lighting to sanitize New York City mass transit during the novel coronavirus pandemic. During a May 20 demonstration, the MTA announced a pilot program with PURO Disinfection Lighting to clean and disinfect subway trains, buses and crew facilities. The MTA pilot program is scheduled to start this week, with the potential to expand to Metro North and Long Island Railroad, as reported by CBS New York. According to the company, PURO lighting units already are being used in hospitals and urgent care clinics, hotels, manufacturing facilities, universities, police and fire departments and fitness centers across the country.

1616447407,2020-05-25 18:03:29,'What the day is all about.' Scaled-down Freehold parade captures the essence of Memorial Day,http://rssfeeds.app.com/~/625148100/0/asburypark/home~What-the-day-is-all-about-Scaleddown-Freehold-parade-captures-the-essence-of-Memorial-Day/,en,False,,84895,blogs.app.com,http://blogs.app.com/#spider,"CLOSE 'Taps' played, church bells tolled and the names of the fallen were read aloud. How one small town kept its tradition alive at a time of loss. FREEHOLD BOROUGH — So much was different about this year’s annual Memorial Day parade. But some things never change. It rained briefly in parts of the Jersey Shore early Monday morning. But not here. Alice McCobb, after all, has very strict rules when it comes to the weather. “It does not rain on my parade,” she said. More: Memorial Day at the Shore: a cloudy, quiet weekend comes to an end Any skepticism about that guarantee ended a long time ago. McCobb, 62, has served as the chair of the town’s Memorial Day Parade Committee for 32 years — so long, in fact, that she has forgotten exactly how she wound up in that role — and more than once over that time the parade’s cancellation due to threatening weather has seemed all but assured. Yet McCobb would not have it. Invariably, the skies would clear and the parade would go on. Alice McCobb (Parade Chair) prepares for Freehold Memorial Day Parade continues the tradition , with Covid 19 restrictions in place . 5/25/20 Photo/James J. Connolly/Correspondent (Photo: James_J_Connolly) This fact explains why borough officials and local residents knew that, in some form, Freehold’s historic parade would take place for a 146th time this year despite a very different kind of threat: a dangerous pandemic that has locked down much of New Jersey for the past two-and-a-half months. The only question was how. Take away all the trappings —the barbecues, the ball games, the concerts, the store sales — and you’re left with the heart of the holiday weekend: Memorial Day itself, a day set aside since the end of the Civil War to honor those who have given their lives in service to their country. In a similar way, McCobb and the rest of the parade committee had to strip this year’s event down to its essence. Due to social distancing mandates there would be no drill teams. No Brownies or Boy Scouts. No bicycle brigade. And no parade-watchers lining the streets. 'The economy needs to reopen': Hundreds protest Murphy's shutdown at Point Pleasant Beach What remained, in the end, was a handful of uniformed veterans leading a horse-drawn caisson — a carriage carrying a casket draped with an American flag — through a quiet, quarantined town. A dog barked. Church bells tolled. The clip-clop of the white horse’s shod feet reverberated along a mostly empty Main Street. Only the birds called out to the marchers this year. At the end of the roughly ¾-mile procession, the names of 48 fallen Freehold residents dating back to the Revolutionary War were read aloud. Many of those watching the livestream feed on Facebook were struck by the solemn simplicity of it all. “This is so touching,"" one post read. ""This ceremony really brings home what the day is all about."" “If this becomes the new ‘normal,’ that would be alright,” another commenter observed. “Alice always comes thru,” said a third. Like Freehold, communities large and small throughout New Jersey and across America had to pause their traditional Memorial Day events this year because of the coronavirus crisis. ""Virtual"" ceremonies and other improvised observances filled the void. In neighboring Colts Neck, for example, residents decked out their vehicles in red, white, and blue for a drive-thru tribute Monday morning. In Bradley Beach, where a ceremony was live-streamed, the mayor asked residents to leave flowers at the base of the World War I monument in Riley Park. Memorial Day 2020: The war monuments of the Jersey Shore No on-site ceremony was possible this year at the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial in Holmdel; the memorial is located on the grounds of the PNC Arts Center, which is still an active COVID-19 test center. Instead, the speakers scheduled for the Memorial Day ceremony spoke via video conference call and other elements of the program were incorporated into a 24-minute video. “We wanted it to be very polished, put together and authentic. I think we managed to pull it off. It was powerful,” said Jillian Decker, the director of development for the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial Foundation. Decker said it took her about 60 hours of work to produce the video, which can be viewed on the foundation’s website. “I still cry every time I see it,” she said. Freehold Memorial Day Parade continues the tradition , with Covid 19 restrictions in place . Morgan Kumpel steers the caisson 5/25/20 Photo/James J. Connolly/Correspondent (Photo: James_J_Connolly) Freehold's Memorial Day parade, which in the past has drawn as many as 10,000 people and more than 70 groups of marchers, is one of the oldest and largest in New Jersey, McCobb said. As far as she knows it was canceled only once, back in the 1960s, ""because they were afraid of riots,"" she said. Another time, a little more than 20 years ago, McCobb halted the parade soon after it got underway because of lightning. ""The safety of the public is paramount,"" McCobb said. Carol Tare Curren is among those who attend the parade here every year. Now living in Jackson, she grew up in Freehold and marched in the parade as a girl. She recently shared a home movie her mother filmed of the 1956 parade on the parade committee's Facebook page. Curren said her late father was the camera buff but he was marching that day. She was 2 at the time. ""There's really nothing quite like it,"" Curren said of the parade. ""And it's really not that different from the video."" You can watch her video below.

While parade organizers and the police urged Freehold residents to remain home this year, not everyone complied. Kevin Coyne, the borough's historian, said he’s never missed the Memorial Day parade and felt compelled to witness this year’s event in person. Coyne, 61, was prepared to use the “but I’m the town historian” excuse if anyone stopped him but that wasn't necessary. Coyne described the scene as “silent” and “strange.” A few people outside donned masks. A banner saying “Stay home, Stay safe” was draped across Main Street in front of the Hall of Records. For Coyne, watching the horse-drawn caisson evoked images of Freehold's earliest Memorial Day observances, which were led by a horse named Dolly that belonged to Union Army Maj. Peter Vredenburgh during the Civil War. A member of a prominent local family and a lawyer by trade, Vredenburgh was shot off his horse and killed leading the 14th New Jersey Volunteers during the Battle of Opequan in Winchester, Virginia, in 1864. For years after the war, Dolly led a solemn procession along Main Street, in the opposite direction of Monday’s route, that culminated at Vredenburgh’s grave at Maplewood Cemetery near present-day Freehold Raceway Mall. “This was an historic event,” Coyne said of Monday's scaled-down parade. “It was really moving,"" he said. ""It so fit the mood of the nation and what everybody's feeling, this sense of unrequited loss.” Shannon Mullen has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and has won numerous other awards for his investigative projects and narrative profiles.

1616508460,2020-05-25 15:07:13,Hundreds gather in Point Beach to protest COVID-19 lockdown,https://starnewsgroup.com/2020/05/25/hundred-gather-to-protest-covid-19-lockdown/,en,False,,650000,Star News Group | The Online Home of The Coast Star & The Ocean Star,http://www.starnewsgroup.com/,"echo do_shortcode('[corner-ad id=1]'); ? 1 of 7 POINT PLEASANT BEACH — As many as 500 demonstrators, some bearing American flags and Trump 2020 campaign banners, crowded into the parking lot at Little Silver Lake on Monday, protesting — and defying — Gov. Phil Murphy’s COVID-19 emergency restrictions. Speakers at the largely peaceful rally included a Bellmawr gym owner who had captured national attention by opening his establishment in violation of the governor’s executive order closing non-essential businesses. Other speakers included members of the New Jersey state legislature, a congressional candidate and a former American Idol contestant and local veterans. Most of the demonstrators were not wearing face masks, despite the general absence of social distancing. ADVERTISEMENT “Why are we here today?” Alya Wolf, of NJ For Freedom and the master of ceremonies for the event, posited the crowd. “That’s why we are here, because Point Pleasant [Beach] is closed.” “What better way to celebrate what all veterans did to this country. They shed blood, they shed tears and gave their lives for the freedoms we are celebrating today,” she added. According to the Facebook page, the Point Pleasant Beach rally was planned to coincide with another “Celebration of Freedom” in Trenton. Organizers said the events were intended to dramatize the plight of small businesses jeopardized by the COVID-19 emergency measure. However, signs of the contentious 2020 presidential campaign were also prominent. Trump 2020 campaign flags were carried by a number of participants, and vendors were selling Trump T-shirts and other paraphernalia. A Facebook post urging participation in the protest featured a meme alleging that COVID-19 was a hoax, as well as links to coronavirus conspiracy videos that have been debunked by fact-checking organizations and news agencies. Point Pleasant Beach police patrolled the area and monitored the activity, at one point turning off the sound system, which drew angry chants of “Turn it on” from the demonstrators. However, police officers generally seemed to exercise restraint at the scene despite the fact that the size of the rally was in apparent violation of state restrictions on gatherings of more than 25 persons.

Protestors gathered at a borough parking lot on Memorial Day morning wanting the state to lift stay at home orders and other restrictions concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Brick resident Jason Carey was among around a thousand people who turned up for a Memorial Day protest opposed to the lockdown guidelines imposed by Gov. Phil Murphy during the current COVID-19 pandemic. (Photo by Bob Vosseller) Organizers and attendees of the event came out early to the Silver Lake Parking Lot – Arnold Avenue and Ocean Avenue as part of a “Freedom March of New Jersey” which kicked off at 11 a.m. and lasted until 4 p.m. The protest that was created on Facebook by a group opposed to the lockdown, ReopenNJ, have been pushing for Gov. Phil Murphy to lift restrictions regarding social distancing and closing non-essential businesses. Ryan Christopher and Jessica Courtney are the administrators of ReopenNJ. “We started this group less than two months ago with just the idea of bringing together a community that could help inform each other and stand up for our freedom and our rights,” Christopher said. “We have since taken a lot of heat for standing up for what we believe in from family and others alike. We are considering camping in front of Murphy’s place on the sidewalk. Since his order made us homeless it would only seem right,” said Christopher. Michele Viventi, Brick came out with her 14-year-old son Ben Sluka with the sign they made for the protest in Point Pleasant Beach on Memorial Day. (Photo by Bob Vosseller) Christopher added, “luckily we have a very supporting community here in ReopenNJ that has helped us with a place to stay and are currently helping donate to our fund to keep us going.” He added, “regardless of what comes our way we will never stand down or silence our voices and the voices of the many New Jersians who stand tall with us.” Christopher said his group wished to see a strong focus on the business owners “who are opening and rising against these insane orders while still opening safely. We gain courage from the courage of every member who speaks their voice.” Philadelphia singer, Brianna Taylor from ABC TV’s American Idol and MTV’s The Real World: Hollywood kicked off the event by singing the national anthem. She sang several other songs during the afternoon. “We can have fun celebrating our liberty today. Sing along everyone,” she said. A DJ who was scheduled for the event was not able to perform. Borough police told an event organizer that this would go contrary to the town’s noise ordinance. Police also noted that no permit for the rally had been required. Most attendees expressed concern about the economic health of the country, particularly small businesses that have had to shut down and have been hurt by coronavirus guidelines. Others were skeptical of the impact of the pandemic. Others felt the country should never have been shut down and cited the Constitution as being violated by the governor. They called his actions an overreach of authority. Michele Viventi of Brick came out with her 14-year-old son Ben Sluka with the sign they made for the protest. She said, “I don’t believe the country should have been shut down in the first place. I don’t believe the virus is a hoax. I just think that the measures that have been taken were way too severe.” She added, “it is a shame that a true virus has been so politicized. The CDC going back and forth on their mask guidelines. I think it would be better to say we’re not sure what the correct way to handle this is based on what happened in Italy. It has become so divisive.” A crowd gathers at the Silver Lake Parking lot in Point Pleasant Beach to call for coronavirus guidelines to be discontinued and for small businesses to be allowed to open up.

This is hurting them. I respect the virus,” Wendy Servio said. Another North Jersey attendee was Steven Freeman of Sussex County. “I think some choices were made at the beginning of this based on a lot of unknowns. I think a lot of data has come out that has shown the risk really outweighs the benefit of having these draconian measures. Businesses are failing right now. A lot of places by me are closing down. I currently am working thankfully by the grace of God.” Brick resident Jason Carey, sported a Jesus T-shirt and a MAGA hat for the event saying, “I am here for these fellows, the business people. I care for their right to have their business open. It is about their right to have their business. Shutting down businesses is what is unconstitutional especially over a fake virus that kills one percent of people. I have COVID. They banned me from the police department so I can’t go there to infect them. This is my third protest in three weeks.” Some onlookers thought the protest was a rally for President Donald Trump’s re-election. One reason for that was Michael Shapiro of Belleville who came dressed in a star-spangled suit and had a booth area with plenty of Trump merchandise to sell. “Politics and the pandemic, it is Memorial Day. You have to make the best of it right?” Trump flags were going for $25 a pop but many protestors came prepared with their own flags for the event. Those flags and hats associated with the president weren’t hard to find. Some, like Kelly and Bill Murphy of Toms River felt that the mix of politics and a pandemic weren’t appropriate. They carried a sign showing a deceased relative who served in the military and died in Korea. “Today this is about opening up the state of New Jersey. I disagree that the Trump stuff, not that we are against him, should be here today,” Bill Murphy said. He added, “the country never should have been locked down. The consequences of shutting down the economy are more dire than COVID-19.” Photo by Bob Vosseller “Our Constitution is getting shredded,” Kelly Murphy said. The rally drew a large number of business owners including Kyle Newell and Ian Smith co-owners of the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, Camden County which was ordered shut down by the state after several days of defying the governor’s orders when they reopened. Democratic State Assemblyman Jamel Holley, Republican Sen. Michael Testa and several Cape May business owners who are currently involved in a lawsuit with Gov. Murphy along with a borough salon owner spoke during the event. Testa noted that “people have been waiting 7-10 weeks for their unemployment checks. We are already one of the most overtaxed states in the country.” The borough’s beach was just a block from the event. Unlike most northern barrier island beaches it was closed. Earlier in the week, Point Pleasant Beach officials said that their beach would not be open in for Memorial Day weekend as it did not have enough staff including special officers in place to handle the influx of visitors. Borough Police Chief Joseph Michigan said, “we share in everyone’s frustrations and anxieties that this pandemic has caused. We hope for the day to come that we will go back to some sense of normalcy. Our hope is this comes sooner than later.” The chief also noted prior to the rally that his department would make their presence known at the event and that they anticipated a large crowd.

We are considering camping in front of Murphy’s place on the sidewalk. Since his order made us homeless it would only seem right,” said Christopher.

(Photo by Bob Vosseller) Christopher added, “luckily we have a very supporting community here in ReopenNJ that has helped us with a place to stay and are currently helping donate to our fund to keep us going.” He added, “regardless of what comes our way we will never stand down or silence our voices and the voices of the many New Jersians who stand tall with us.” Christopher said his group wished to see a strong focus on the business owners “who are opening and rising against these insane orders while still opening safely. We gain courage from the courage of every member who speaks their voice.” Philadelphia singer, Brianna Taylor from ABC TV’s American Idol and MTV’s The Real World: Hollywood kicked off the event by singing the national anthem. She sang several other songs during the afternoon. “We can have fun celebrating our liberty today. Sing along everyone,” she said. A DJ who was scheduled for the event was not able to perform. Borough police told an event organizer that this would go contrary to the town’s noise ordinance. Police also noted that no permit for the rally had been required. Most attendees expressed concern about the economic health of the country, particularly small businesses that have had to shut down and have been hurt by coronavirus guidelines. Others were skeptical of the impact of the pandemic. Others felt the country should never have been shut down and cited the Constitution as being violated by the governor. They called his actions an overreach of authority. Michele Viventi of Brick came out with her 14-year-old son Ben Sluka with the sign they made for the protest. She said, “I don’t believe the country should have been shut down in the first place. I don’t believe the virus is a hoax. I just think that the measures that have been taken were way too severe.” She added, “it is a shame that a true virus has been so politicized. The CDC going back and forth on their mask guidelines. I think it would be better to say we’re not sure what the correct way to handle this is based on what happened in Italy. It has become so divisive.” A crowd gathers at the Silver Lake Parking lot in Point Pleasant Beach to call for coronavirus guidelines to be discontinued and for small businesses to be allowed to open up. (Photo by Bob Vosseller) Another early arrival to the event were Wendy and Steve Servio who traveled from Essex County for the rally. “We should allow these small businesses to open up. This is hurting them. I respect the virus,” Wendy Servio said. Another North Jersey attendee was Steven Freeman of Sussex County. “I think some choices were made at the beginning of this based on a lot of unknowns. I think a lot of data has come out that has shown the risk really outweighs the benefit of having these draconian measures. Businesses are failing right now. A lot of places by me are closing down. I currently am working thankfully by the grace of God.” Brick resident Jason Carey, sported a Jesus T-shirt and a MAGA hat for the event saying, “I am here for these fellows, the business people. I care for their right to have their business open. It is about their right to have their business. Shutting down businesses is what is unconstitutional especially over a fake virus that kills one percent of people. I have COVID. They banned me from the police department so I can’t go there to infect them. This is my third protest in three weeks.” Some onlookers thought the protest was a rally for President Donald Trump’s re-election. One reason for that was Michael Shapiro of Belleville who came dressed in a star-spangled suit and had a booth area with plenty of Trump merchandise to sell. “Politics and the pandemic, it is Memorial Day. You have to make the best of it right?” Trump flags were going for $25 a pop but many protestors came prepared with their own flags for the event. Those flags and hats associated with the president weren’t hard to find. Some, like Kelly and Bill Murphy of Toms River felt that the mix of politics and a pandemic weren’t appropriate. They carried a sign showing a deceased relative who served in the military and died in Korea. “Today this is about opening up the state of New Jersey. I disagree that the Trump stuff, not that we are against him, should be here today,” Bill Murphy said. He added, “the country never should have been locked down. The consequences of shutting down the economy are more dire than COVID-19.” Photo by Bob Vosseller “Our Constitution is getting shredded,” Kelly Murphy said. The rally drew a large number of business owners including Kyle Newell and Ian Smith co-owners of the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, Camden County which was ordered shut down by the state after several days of defying the governor’s orders when they reopened. Democratic State Assemblyman Jamel Holley, Republican Sen. Michael Testa and several Cape May business owners who are currently involved in a lawsuit with Gov. Murphy along with a borough salon owner spoke during the event. Testa noted that “people have been waiting 7-10 weeks for their unemployment checks. We are already one of the most overtaxed states in the country.” The borough’s beach was just a block from the event. Unlike most northern barrier island beaches it was closed. Earlier in the week, Point Pleasant Beach officials said that their beach would not be open in for Memorial Day weekend as it did not have enough staff including special officers in place to handle the influx of visitors. Borough Police Chief Joseph Michigan said, “we share in everyone’s frustrations and anxieties that this pandemic has caused. We hope for the day to come that we will go back to some sense of normalcy. Our hope is this comes sooner than later.” The chief also noted prior to the rally that his department would make their presence known at the event and that they anticipated a large crowd. K-9 dogs sniffed vehicles parked in the parking lot early on during the event.

The Ocean County Sheriff’s Office was also working with borough police to maintain order at the rally site. “We respect everyone’s constitutional rights to assemble and peacefully protest,” However, in abundance of caution, residents and visitors should expect to see a very high visible law enforcement presence, the chief said.",0.0

""We encourage all guests to take social distancing very seriously and help us create the safest environment on the Jersey Shore."" The move comes after officials kept the boardwalk and beaches closed for Memorial Day weekend over concerns that the borough did not have enough seasonal Special Class I police officers to patrol the crowds, an issue several Shore towns are facing at the early part of the summer season. Kanitra told the Asbury Park Press last week that the borough only had a third of the seasonal officers it needed. The mayor said Tuesday that the police department had ""increased their numbers and will be at full seasonal strength within a few weeks."" Officials were also concerned about keeping visitors separated on narrow portions of the boardwalk, which is about 15-feet wide at some points.

The company, which owns much of the borough's beachfront, had kept its beaches closed for Memorial Day weekend because visitors need to cross the now-closed boardwalk to access them. The decision also comes the day after about 200 demonstrators rallied in Point Pleasant Beach to protest coronavirus restrictions and demand the state move more quickly to reopen businesses shuttered because of the pandemic. Parking restrictions will be partially scaled back beginning Friday to allow private and public lots near the boardwalk to open. Restrictions will be lifted entirely by June 5, officials said. Parking at the Manasquan Inlet will be fully accessible by Wednesday. Officials urged visitors to maintain the recommended six-foot distance while fishing or spending time at the inlet.

Phil Murphy relaxed some social distancing guidelines designed to stave off future coronavirus outbreaks, state officials said Tuesday. “The anecdotal evidence was decent,” Murphy said during his daily briefing in Trenton. “Did we learn a lot of lessons from this weekend? I’m afraid only to a degree because the weather wasn’t great.” Advertisement Cooler than normal temperatures and rain kept many New Jerseyans and out-of-state visitors from returning to the Jersey Shore on Saturday. While there were reports of incidents in Monmouth Beach and Long Beach Township, and the use of face masks wasn’t quite up to the governor’s liking, “what we saw were very good signs.” With hospital data showing persistent declines in the number of Covid-19 cases, Murphy began to take several steps to unwind elements of a March 21 stay-at-home order that put the kibosh on many outdoor recreational activities and much of the state’s retail economy. On Friday, he increased the maximum size of outdoor gatherings to 25, giving visitors and residents some bandwidth to resume shore-related activities that are hallmarks of New Jersey summers. The same order allowed professional sport teams like the New York Giants, Jets and New Jersey Devils to resume practice and training at New Jersey facilities as soon as their leagues permit. There were around a dozen citations issued between Friday afternoon and Monday, State Police Superintendent Pat Callahan said during Tuesday morning’s briefing. Those included house parties where attendees failed to remain six feet part and a motel owner in Wildwood who opened up for business in violation of a local ordinance. While it went unmentioned during official remarks at Murphy's briefing, there was also a reopening protest in Point Pleasant attended by Sens. Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris) and Mike Testa (R-Cumberland) as well as Assemblyman Jamel Holley (D-Union). “While not batting 1.000, perhaps, overall, pretty impressive,” Murphy said. As of Monday night, New Jersey hospitals were treating 2,723 residents for confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19, down by roughly two-thirds compared to when the state was navigating its surge in mid-April. Fewer than 790 patients required intensive or critical care and 578 were on ventilators. New Jersey reported 703 new positive cases on Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 155,764 confirmed coronavirus patients. And as testing capacity climbs — the state was already exceeding its benchmark of 20,000 tests per day, Murphy said — the daily spot positivity rate continues to fall. That rate had dipped down to 5 percent as of May 21. Even so, the state also reported another 54 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Tuesday. The total number of deaths that have been affirmatively linked to the disease stood 11,191 as of Tuesday morning. “We continue to see many positive signs that we can continue to move forward,” Murphy said. “We’re hopeful that nothing will change in the near future given how many residents and visitors were out across our state throughout this past weekend.”",0.0

1617561462,2020-05-26 22:17:16,What we know about the death of George Floyd: 4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media,http://rssfeeds.northjersey.com/~/625263896/0/northjerseynews~What-we-know-about-the-death-of-George-Floyd-Minneapolis-police-officers-fired-after-horrifying-video-hits-social-media/,en,False,,65,"The Record - Hackensack,NJ ",http://www.northjersey.com/,"Government officials and Minnesota locals alike expressed outrage after a video surfaced showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man and ignoring his pleas for help until first responders put him, unresponsive, on a stretcher. The man, identified at 46-year-old George Floyd, died at a local hospital, according to police. The case echoes the death of Eric Garner, another black man who died while a white officer restrained him, ignoring pleas of ""I can't breathe."" The four officers involved in the Monday incident were fired Tuesday, and the attorney for Floyd's family, Ben Crump, called for their arrests. The officers have yet to be officially identified, but attorney Tom Kelly told The Associated Press he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. Kelly declined further comment. Here's what we know so far: What's in the video? A video taken by a bystander circulating on social media shows Chauvin with his knee pressed into Floyd's neck while the man repeatedly says he can't breathe. Floyd repeatedly pleads with Chauvin, at one point crying out for his mother and saying ""everything hurts."" Two officers are featured prominently in the video — Chauvin and an officer who stands between bystanders and the officer on top of Floyd. “He’s talking, he’s fine,” one officer says to a person off-camera. GBI says investigation wrapping up:Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery shooting arrested “He ain’t fine,” the person replies before calling the officer a “bum” and saying he’s “enjoying what’s happening.” Chauvin keeps his knee pressed into Floyd’s neck and Floyd stops talking. About four minutes into the video, Floyd becomes unresponsive. Bystanders approach Chauvin and the officer draws something, causing one of the people off-camera to say, “He’s got mace.” Bystanders repeatedly ask the officers to check for a pulse. Chauvin doesn’t remove his knee from the man's neck until EMS puts an unresponsive Floyd onto a stretcher, roughly four minutes after he stopped responding. What is a 'neck restraint'? The Minneapolis Police Department's Policy & Procedure Manual defines a neck restraint as a ""non-deadly force option."" The handbook reads: ""Defined as compressing one or both sides of a person’s neck with an arm or leg, without applying direct pressure to the trachea or airway (front of the neck). Only sworn employees who have received training from the MPD Training Unit are authorized to use neck restraints."" The book has two types of neck restraints: Conscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with intent to control, and not to render the subject unconscious, by only applying light to moderate pressure. Unconscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with the intention of rendering the person unconscious by applying adequate pressure. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday, was asked about the use of the knee on Floyd's neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, explaining that those policies “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” What do police say happened? The Minneapolis Police Department released a statement Monday that said officers responded to a report of a forgery in progress just after 8 p.m. Police discovered a suspect and ordered him to get out of his car. ""After he got out, he physically resisted officers,"" MPD said in a statement. ""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later."" No weapons were used by anyone in the incident, according to the MDP statement, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was called to investigate the incident. Calling police:White woman fired after calling police on black man who asked her to leash her dog Police on Tuesday updated the statement to add, ""As additional information has been made available, it has been determined that the Federal Bureau of Investigations will be a part of this investigation."" The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is assisting with the investigation. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension released a statement saying, ""The names of the officers involved will be released once initial interviews with incident participants and witnesses have taken place."" Who are George Floyd and Derek Chauvin? Floyd, who worked security at Conga Latin Bistro, was described as a ""gentle giant,"" the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Tuesday. On Facebook, the restaurant posted pictures of Floyd, including one of him smiling at the camera in a ""security"" T-shirt. The caption reads, ""We will always remember you."" Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. What's the response? The four officers involved in the incident were fired, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Tuesday afternoon. On Facebook, Frey said, ""Being Black in America should not be a death sentence."" ""Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth, he should still be with us this morning,"" the mayor said. ""I believe what I saw and what I saw is wrong on every level."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also took to social media to demand answers. Sen. Amy Klobuchar called the video ""horrifying"" and ""gut-wrenching"" and called for an investigation. More:Indiana lawmaker accused of racism for posting meme of black children celebrating 'free money' ""The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening,"" Walz tweeted. ""We will get answers and seek justice."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called for a ""thorough"" FBI investigation. ""George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice,"" Biden tweeted. ""His life mattered. I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions."" Protesters filled the intersection in the street where Floyd died on Tuesday night, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 21/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Crump, who is also part of the team representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, the black jogger who was shot and killed after allegedly being pursued by a white father and son in Georgia, called the firing of the four officers a good ""first step"" in a statement. On Twitter, Crump called for the four officers to be arrested on murder charges. ""How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?"" Crump said in a statement. Contributing: The Associated Press.",0.0
1618436813,2020-05-27 18:23:53,"‘We all feel at risk’: 100,000 people dead from COVID-19 in the U.S.",https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/we-all-feel-at-risk-100000-people-dead-from-covid-19-in-the-u-s/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has reached a somber milestone: as of Wednesday afternoon, the highly infectious viral disease has taken more than 100,000 lives nationwide. Soaring from two known coronavirus fatalities in February to more than 58,000 in April, the tally of U.S. deaths — in a country with fewer than 5% of the world’s inhabitants — now accounts for nearly one-third of all the known lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. According to a mortality analysis by Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, about 6% of the nearly 1.7 million people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the U.S. have now succumbed to the disease. Public health experts say the coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of a wide range of Americans and the shortcomings of a U.S. health care system faced with a deadly pandemic. “What is different about this is, it is affecting all of us in a variety of ways, even if some of us are able to social distance in more effective ways than others,” says sociology professor Kathleen Cagney, who directs The University of Chicago’s Population Research Center. “But we all feel at risk.” Even some who are well acquainted with earlier health scourges in the U.S. were caught off guard by this one. “I think anybody who understands anything about infectious disease recognizes that we were going to sooner or later face something like this,” said John Barry, a professor at Tulane University School of Public Health And Tropical Medicine and author of “The Great Influenza: The Story Of The Deadliest Pandemic In History,” on NPR’s Fresh Air earlier this month. “But, you know, intellectually understanding it is one thing, and having it hit you is something quite different.” Demographic disparities in deaths People have died from the disease in all 50 states and most U.S. territories. But the impact has been felt unevenly. Demographic statistics that the CDC has posted of the first nearly 69,000 fatalities show some striking disparities: — The disease has been far deadlier for males than females. For age groups up to 75 years old, about twice as many men and boys have been killed by COVID-19 as have women and girls. — Older people have died in much greater numbers than those who are younger. Eighty percent of the known fatalities were at least 65 years old. — Racial and ethnic disparities in who is dying have also become apparent, even while tracking data that has been compiled by Johns Hopkins is still incomplete. In Alabama, for example, 44% of those killed by COVID-19 were black, in a state where fewer than 27% of its residents are African American. Similarly, while African Americans make up 14% of Michigan’s population, they account for 40% of that state’s COVID-19 fatalities. Native American communities have also been hit especially hard by the pandemic. In Arizona, Native Americans account for about 5% of the population but comprise nearly 17% of that state’s COVID-19 fatalities. The University of Chicago’s Cagney said that differences in socioeconomic status — and thus the ability to practice social distancing — are contributing to COVID-19’s uneven lethal impact. “If you look at the locations where people are disproportionately dying, they are in places that are lower income,” said Cagney. “They are places that likely have multiple residents in a single unit space. They are places where people rely on public transit and rely on services like big box locations where by entry alone you’re putting yourself at risk.” The degree of devastation wrought by the pathogen has taken even some public health experts by surprise. “Back in March, I did not think this would be possible — I was not expecting 100,000 deaths,” said Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “I really believed we as a nation would have taken the decision to put in place social distancing and accepted the economic hardship that it’s creating, and that we would have stuck to it to get transmission down to a very low level,” he added. A study done this month by a Columbia University research team suggests the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. could have been considerably lower had Americans been told sooner to stay home and maintain social distancing. A “pre-print” version of the report — meaning it has yet to be peer reviewed — finds that “55% of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier.” By that measure, the nationwide death toll on that date of 65,307 could have instead stood at 29,410 — meaning nearly 36,000 lives might have been saved. “The lesson isn’t what this means for the next time we have a pandemic with a new virus,” says Jeffrey Shaman, one of the study’s co-authors. “The lesson is really what are we doing with this virus as we move forward that it isn’t going anywhere and that we still have to contend with it.” Asked on Thursday about the Columbia University study, President Trump dismissed it as “just a political hit job.” A roller coaster ride of presidential predictions The number of Americans killed by the pandemic appears to be a sensitive subject for a president seeking reelection in November. His predictions have gone up and down several times. “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China,” Trump told CNBC on Jan. 22, one day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. “We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Five weeks later, on Feb. 27 — almost a month after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” — Trump continued to downplay the threat posed by the coronavirus. “You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” Trump declared at a White House coronavirus task force briefing. “That’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” But the numbers kept rising. By the end of March, with the WHO having already declared a global pandemic, Johns Hopkins was reporting more than 188,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in the U.S. and some 5,500 deaths. That was when Trump executed an abrupt U-turn in his effort to manage public expectations: for the first time, he broached the possibility that the pandemic — far from nearing zero — could indeed end up claiming 100,000 U.S. lives. Speaking from the White House Rose Garden on March 29, Trump cited new mortality projections by Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The two had predicted that if no preventive measures were taken, the pandemic could cause 2.2 million deaths in the U.S.; if such measures were taken, the toll could be between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths over an unspecified period of time. “And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000,” Trump said, “so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job.” Three weeks later, amid mounting pressure from supporters to reopen the mostly quarantined economy, Trump was back to lowering public expectations about how many lives the pandemic might claim. “One is too many. But we’re going toward 50- or 60,000 people,” Trump declared on April 20. “That’s at the lower — as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We — we could end up at 50 to 60.” Trump appeared to be relying on one of the lowest of a dozen fatality estimates at the time, a range of 60,000 to 115,000 deaths modeled by the University of Washington’s IHME. But a week later, with social distancing measures being eased, the IHME practically doubled those projected numbers, forecasting that nearly 135,000 — and possibly as many as 242,890 — people would die by August in the U.S. from COVID-19. IHME’s Murray says the earlier calculations had been made assuming every state would hold off on loosening social distancing measures until new infections had dropped to a very low level. “But even before people started relaxing the mandates, people start changing their behavior as the national discussion about reopening the economy became pretty dominant,” says Murray, adding that his team realized keeping those mandates in place until early June “was just not going to happen. And so that’s what led to our major change in the modeling’s strategy and assumptions.” Trump, for his part, once again raised his predictions about how many lives in the U.S. the pandemic would claim. “I used to say 65,000,” he declared May 3 during a Fox News interview held at the Lincoln Memorial. “And now I’m saying 80 or 90, and it goes up and it goes up rapidly. But it’s still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the very lower end of the plane.” By mid-May, all of the dozen forecasting models for COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. tracked by the CDC surpassed Trump’s latest predictions. “All forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks,” CDC Director Robert Redfield, in his first public comment on expected deaths, tweeted on May 15. Every one of those models, he added, predicted “a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1.” Many more deaths expected — and funerals With all 50 states now separately dropping some or all of their social distancing restrictions, health experts warn that the U.S. coronavirus death toll could climb much higher than the approximately 140,000 by August that many of them have been predicting. “Now we’re almost getting the worst of both worlds — we’re getting the economic hardship and we’re relaxing,” said the IHME’s Murray. “And it seems either now or in the fall, we’re going to have a big second wave and we’ll be right back to dealing with pressure on the hospital system and dealing with, when is the peak surge coming?” Columbia University’s Shaman said the U.S. has to keep suppressing the spread of COVID-19 while having an acceptable level of a functioning economy. “That’s the hard problem we’re trying to address as we try to figure that out and we loosen restrictions,” said Shaman. “If we have these flare-ups, we have to be willing to immediately recognize them and tamp back down and not wait and not dither. And that goes both for communities that have experienced the virus already and those that have not experienced it as much.” And there’s another challenge: Many of the 100,000 who have died have not yet had proper send-offs. “It’s been stunning to me that we have had as much death as we’ve had, with as little attention to all those deaths,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “I think one of the reasons we’ve had so little attention to all of this is because we’ve not had the kind of public mourning that comes with mass casualties like this.” Jha expects that as the U.S. opens up from its social isolation, those who have grieved privately will be holding postponed funerals, burials and other commemorations. “I think the sort of the weight of this calamity is going to become much more apparent to people in the upcoming days and weeks,” Jha added. “So people are going to, I think, really come to grips with how awful these last couple of months have been.”",0.0

Police said they were investigating Wednesday night’s death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Multiple fires burned early Thursday at buildings and smoke hung over the city. Fire crews worked to put out flames. Blocks of buildings with broken-out windows and other damage from looting were seen, and KSTP-TV reported that some people were seen going through buildings.",0.0

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

The video of Floyd's killing has prompted the Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor to call for criminal charges against the officers involved. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI said they are investigating after President Donald Trump tweeted in support of a swift probe. Police said Floyd had matched the description of someone who tried to use a counterfeit bill at a convenience store.

""They're not going to meet their clergy and their pastors around yellow crime-scene tape in the state of New Jersey,"" he said. ""We're doing it at barbecues, we're doing it in church basements, in town halls, knowing that something that happens halfway across the country … impacts us right here."" In a separate statement Thursday, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina called Floyd's death ""deeply troubling and indefensible.""

He urged people upset by Floyd's death ""to please channel that anger, sadness and frustration into something positive. Do not use it as an excuse to lash out in a negative way."" In Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw expressed sympathy for people shaken by another example of apparent police brutality. ""Throughout the nation, communities of color are tired of reliving atrocities such as this over and over again,"" she said. ""They are sick and tired of being sick and tired.""

Delaware News Journal Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, typically not one to speak out about issues involving race, wrote ""the institutional racism in this country breaks my heart and needs to stop"" in a social media post Thursday night. Wentz was referring to the death of George Floyd, an African-American, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on Monday.

""I'm never going to act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already. ""I’ll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color ... I don’t understand the society we live in that doesn’t value all human life.

ROOKIE RANKINGS: With no spring practices, these Eagles' rookies will be counted on to contribute this season Wentz wasn't the only white Eagles player to speak out Thursday night. Tight end Zach Ertz also posted a statement about Floyd, saying he has been trying for the past few days ""to come up with the perfect words in regards to George Floyd and the tragic murder that took place in Minnesota."" Ertz added: ""What I do know is that I am so unbelievably sorry. I am sorry for the pain and hurt that the African American community has endured by another human, and more than anything, I am sorry that you feel that you are alone in this situation.""

Many players are convinced that Kaepernick, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2016, was blackballed by the NFL for kneeling during the anthem. Jenkins had often said that it'll take white players joining in the protests for the message of social injustices to gain traction. During the 2017 season, Eagles defensive end Chris Long, who is white, would put his arm on Jenkins' shoulder as he raised his fist. On Thursday, Wentz and Ertz made a similar symbolic gesture.

As Gov. Phil Murphy and the Legislature work on adopting a state budget that reflects our new reality, I urge them, in the words of Abigail Adams, to “Remember the ladies ...” A budget is, at its heart, an expression of a society’s priorities, and therefore New Jersey’s spending plan must reflect our state’s progressive values. The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has hit women, particularly women of color, disproportionately. In April, the majority of jobs lost were held by women. Women are more likely to hold jobs in industries like retail, hospitality and medical offices that have been shuttered as a result of mandatory business closures and social-distancing. And because women make less than their male counterparts, they are less likely to have the financial resources to outlast the recession brought on by the pandemic. This creates a snowball effect. Women are more likely to forgo necessary medical care as layoffs continue. They are at greater risk of losing their homes to foreclosure and eviction. The state’s domestic violence shelters are nearly at capacity as women cut off from extended social networks face increased danger of domestic violence. Now, when they are most needed, the tattered social safety nets that these women rely on are stretched to their limit. The 2021 budget must preserve funding for crucial programs that serve our most vulnerable residents — such as health care, housing assistance and education. Murphy’s proposal to take advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow money would tide the state over while the economy recovers. Trenton should indeed take maximum advantage of the Federal Reserve’s new program to stabilize state and local governments facing pandemic-induced revenue shortfalls. THE LATEST: Coronavirus cases up to 155,764 as deaths rise to 11,191 (May 26) OPEN NOW, SOME SAY: 'The economy needs to reopen': Hundreds protest Murphy's shutdown at Point Pleasant Beach SUPPORT OUR JOURNALISM: Now is a great time to subscribe to NorthJersey.com. See our special limited-time offers For eight years, the working families of New Jersey found themselves pushed aside by the austerity forced on our state by the former administration. In the last two years, the state has finally begun to prioritize their needs. We cannot afford to walk back the progress our state has made in increasing access to health care, expanding pre-K and ensuring food security for low-income residents. Working with legislative leaders, Murphy restored critical funding for Planned Parenthood’s reproductive health services that had been repeatedly vetoed by former Gov. Chris Christie and further aggravated by the Trump administration’s Title X Gag Rule. First Lady Tammy Murphy’s initiatives to improve outcomes for African-American maternal and infant health, led to the expansion of the state medicaid program to include coverage for doula care. Anjali Mehrotra (Photo: National Organization for Women of New Jersey) Funding to provide support for domestic violence victims is at an all-time high, thanks to the work of Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg and Assembly Budget Chair Eliana Pintor Marin. And Assembly Speaker Coughlin has pushed a package of bills to close the hunger gap by increasing resources to food banks, tackling the problem of food deserts and strengthening free — and reduced-breakfast and lunch programs that serve our neediest schoolchildren. All of these gains would be jeopardized by a bare-bones budget that cuts services at a time when New Jersey residents, especially women, need increased support to withstand the economic and social crisis the pandemic has sparked. Private non-profits, whose budgets are being strained by both skyrocketing need and serious fiscal challenges, can’t do it alone. In just one example, shelters and food banks must rely on donations to provide menstrual products to residents struggling financially. Only government can marshal the resources necessary to address this and other challenges. Our state is facing an unprecedented crisis, and we need to take advantage of every tool at our disposal to weather the current storm. While borrowing should never be the first choice of responsible governments in normal times, this is hardly a normal time. A pullback of state resources now would only extend the economic fallout of the pandemic while deepening the pain faced by New Jersey’s women and their families. Even as we face the challenge of the present crisis, we must commit to an equitable recovery. Anjali Mehrotra is president of the National Organization for Women of New Jersey.

In an early Friday news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he made the decision to surrender the building as the crowd of protesters grew and tensions escalated on the third night of demonstrations following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. ""It became obvious to me that safety was at risk,"" Frey said, pledging that police would continue to serve residents in the precinct and that the building was ""just bricks and mortar."" ""The decision comes down to public safety, period,"" he said. Follow the George Floyd story:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Donald Trump on Minneapolis protests:Mayor Jacob Frey 'weak,' 'thugs' dishonor George Floyd's memory The Minneapolis Police Department said in a statement that the precinct was evacuated shortly after 10 p.m. ""in the interest of the safety of our personnel."" The MPD confirmed that protesters ""ignited several fires,"" but didn't offer additional information. Protesters celebrated — cheering, honking car horns and setting off fireworks — as fires burned at the precinct. Hundreds of protesters flooded Minneapolis streets earlier Thursday for a march through downtown. Traffic was halted as a crowd of people stretched for up to four blocks. Protesters shouted “I can’t breathe” and “no justice, no peace; prosecute the police” as volunteer marshals in highlighter-colored vests directed traffic. ""The people of Minneapolis are not just protesting the public execution of George Floyd; they're fighting for their lives. Mr. Floyd's death — in addition to the recent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor — is yet another reminder of American law enforcement's toxic tradition of abuse, negligence, violence, and discrimination toward black people,"" Scott Roberts, senior director of criminal justice campaigns at Color Of Change, said in a statement. What we know:Federal authorities pledge 'robust' investigation into George Floyd's death; Minnesota National Guard activated ""The protests in Minneapolis are efforts by black and brown activists to rise up against centuries-old racism within the police department and prosecutors office and resist the white supremacy that has claimed far too many black lives."" The demonstration began after a round of speeches that started at 5 p.m. at the Hennepin County Government Center. Mel Reeves, a longtime activist in the city, encouraged the crowd to be peaceful. He said officials use damaging or violent protests to distract from the true issue of police brutality. “They wanna use us to keep us from getting justice ... they act like animals, then wanna make us look like animals,” Reeves told the crowd before directing them down South Third Avenue. 'They executed my brother':George Floyd's brother calls for arrests, peaceful demonstrations Unrest in the area continued, too. Frey issued a declaration of a local emergency following ""civil disturbance"" in the wake of Floyd's death. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted a call to ""rebuild."" ""George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,"" Walz said. Meeting with reporters early Friday, Frey pleaded for residents' help: ""We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now."" Just after 6 p.m., a crowd of at least 300 people gathered at the intersection of Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue. As smoke from several burned-out buildings filled the air, protesters chanted and demanded justice. “We can’t breathe,” they yelled. “We can’t breathe.” While the core of the protest focused on police brutality and institutional racism, it also took on, at times, the air of a carnival, with young men and women riding bikes into the area to watch. 'Gentle giant':George Floyd remembered as family calls his death 'murder' A young woman casually spray-painted “(expletive) the police” on a metal sign while across the street a man tried to tip over a port-a-potty. Protests continued elsewhere, too. In some cases, so did the chaos. Police in New York City clashed with protesters on Thursday night. NYPD Lt. John Grimpel told USA TODAY that there had been ""numerous"" arrests in Lower Manhattan. He said an officer was hit in the head with a garbage can, another was punched in the face and others had been spit on. Meanwhile, Colorado state Rep. Leslie Herod said someone ""shot into the rally"" taking place at the State Capitol in Denver. A local reporter confirmed shots were fired, but the Denver Police Department said there were no reports of injuries. Later Thursday night in Denver, a video on Twitter showed a person in a car allegedly trying to run over a protester. ""You can be angry. You can be outraged. I certainly am and I join you in those feelings and demands of #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd,"" Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said on Twitter. ""March for justice and to see it served, but please march in peace. Responding to violence with violence will only lead to more violence."" Dozens of protesters — many wearing face masks — gathered in Chicago’s South Side Englewood neighborhood on Thursday afternoon. Videos shared to social media showed protesters holding signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and chanting “no justice no peace, no racist police.” Opinion:Video of George Floyd pinned by Minneapolis cops is shocking but not surprising There were two groups of protesters, and one person was arrested for disorderly conduct, the city’s superintendent, David Brown, said during an evening press conference. The demonstration “otherwise ended peacefully,” he said. Reports of protests in Phoenix and Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday night indicated large crowds of protesters. The protests started with minimal violence, however, like in other areas across the nation, things escalated. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for the Louisville Metro Police Department, confirmed to the Louisville Courier-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, that shots were fired around 11:30 p.m. At least seven people were shot and at least one of the victims was in critical condition, police confirmed. The protest in Louisville followed the death of Taylor, who was shot by police after officers executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant and exchanged gunfire with Taylor's boyfriend, who said he did not hear officers announce themselves before firing a single shot. Taylor was shot at least eight times. Contributing: Steve Kiggins, USA TODAY",0.0

Written by McCarter’s outgoing Artistic Director and Resident Playwright Emily Mann, the docudrama examines the trial for the murder of Harvey Milk — and reactions from a “Chorus of Uncalled Witnesses.” Above: “My name is Harvey Milk, and I’m here to recruit you!” (Photo ©1978 by Daniel Nicoletta) By Donald H. Sanborn III Emily Mann started writing Execution of Justice in 1983, seven years before she began her 30-year tenure as McCarter Theatre’s artistic director and resident playwright. The docudrama examines the trial of Dan White, who in 1978 assassinated San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk; the latter was the first openly gay official to be elected in California. Execution of Justice was commissioned by San Francisco’s Eureka Theatre Company. The play was presented in 1985 by Arena Stage in Washington D.C. A Broadway production followed in 1986. McCarter hosted an online community reading of Execution of Justice last Friday. The event commemorated the 90th anniversary of Harvey Milk’s birth, and was presented in collaboration with the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice. “No theatrical or performance experience is presumed; this is not a performance,” Artistic Engagement Manager Paula T. Alekson assured a multigenerational and diverse group of over 50 participants who had logged into Zoom, or dialed into a specially designated telephone line, to play one of the roles. Readers who participated via Zoom were asked to log in using their first name and last initial; before the reading started their captions were edited to identify the characters they were portraying. Certain roles, such as defense attorney Douglas Schmidt, were portrayed by different readers for each of the play’s two acts. Mann helped read the part of Sister Boom Boom, the activist and drag nun, who is scripted as a voice for Milk’s supporters. Mann prefaced the event by recounting the play’s genesis. During a cab ride from the venue where Eureka was presenting her play Still Life, Mann asked the driver, “What is the most important memory you have of recent history in your community?” The driver responded, “I was driving my cab, when on the radio it came that [Milk and Moscone] had been shot and killed.” Mann remembers, “It shattered his world. It happened again when the verdict [in which White was sentenced for manslaughter rather than murder] came down, and the people rioted; and his taxi was set on fire. So I thought, ‘this is an unhealed wound in this city.’” Alekson explained, “As a documentary theater piece the words in the play are the authentic words of the people who spoke them — in all their beauty and thoughtfulness, as well as in their ugliness and ignorance. So we’ll honor the words, understanding that words have power.” Resident Production Stage Manager Cheryl Mintz read the stage directions, which begin: “A bare stage. A white screen overhead. On screen: images of San Francisco. Hot, fast music. Images of Milk and Moscone punctuate the visuals.” Act one, subtitled “Murder,” opens with White admitting to his wife Mary Ann, “I shot the mayor and Harvey.” The play’s thematic conflict is established by juxtaposing monologues delivered by a Cop, who wears a “Free Dan White” T-shirt; and Sister Boom Boom, who decries “the cycle of brutality and ignorance which pervades our culture.” The prosecution and defense select a jury. Prosecutor Thomas F. Norman presents the facts of the case, including White’s resignation from his position as the supervisor of District 8, and his possible withdrawal of that resignation, as well as the victims’ wounds. Defense attorney Schmidt paints White as an as an “idealistic young man” who “believed very strongly in the traditional American values,” highlighting his service in Vietnam, as well as his civil service as a police officer and fireman. Toward the end of the act we hear White protest to a homicide inspector, “I’m trying to do a good job and I saw this city as it’s going, kind of downhill and I was always just a lonely vote on the board. I was trying to do a good job for the city.” The second act is subtitled “In Defense of Murder.” Schmidt posits that White’s recent junk food diet is indicative of depression that resulted in diminished capacity. This “Twinkie Defense” persuades the jury that White’s decision-making was impaired; he is convicted of manslaughter, and a furious judge — identified only as “The Court” — imposes a light sentence of seven years and eight months. (White committed suicide in 1985.) A “Chorus of Uncalled Witnesses” reacts to the trial and verdict. A character identified as Young Mother observes, “To this jury Dan White was their son.” Another character, identified as “Milk’s Friend,” reflects on assassinations: “I remember coming home from school in second grade — JFK was killed — five years later, Martin Luther King. It’s a frame of reference.” The event, which lasted nearly four hours, concluded with a “talking circle.” Several listeners admitted to being conflicted between admiring the performance of the reader who portrayed White, and anger at his actions and words. Mann observed this cognitive dissonance as well: “I didn’t have any sympathy for Dan White when I was writing it! Once it was performed … people were sobbing. That, to me, is interesting; it’s what theater is all about.” A participant named Eddie praised Mann’s nuanced approach to White’s character, and compared him to George Zimmerman, who killed Trayvon Martin. “As much as we may despise Dan White, and hate what he did … we need to look at the generations behind and say, “How was Dan White created?” Others observed the play’s contemporary relevance, wondering aloud how much the culture has changed since that time. A participant named Lisa believes, “We think a lot differently about mental illness now than we did at the time that this trial took place. People talk about it more openly now … having a daughter with disabilities, I especially feel close to Harvey Milk as a character, for trying to help people who didn’t know where else to turn.” Aside from standard technical issues such as the necessity of speakers remembering to un-mute themselves, the event proceeded remarkably smoothly, given the scope of the undertaking and the number of participants. Despite Alekson’s comment that no acting experience was “presumed or required,” the vast majority of performances were impassioned and convincing. The reader who portrayed The Court wore black, and used a Zoom background that resembled a courtroom. The online format did have some disadvantages. Crowd scenes, such as the candlelight vigil for Harvey Milk, would have benefited from the energy that comes from being able to perform in a physical space. But in other ways the format serves the play well. Mann’s script slightly predates the prevalence of talk radio, cable news, and social media. Listening to people read the dialogue in their own homes allows one to find equivalence to reactions to contemporary events. The reader playing Schmidt wore headphones, looking a bit like a talk show host. Characters such as Young Mother could have been posting live videos of themselves on Facebook, sharing their reactions to recent news. At one point Alekson remarked, “Tonight is about purpose.” Observing over a hundred people logged into Zoom, for the purpose of sharing the opportunity to interact with a play that probes a telling moment in recent history, was moving.

Riv's Toms River Hub on Thursday issued the mea culpa on its Facebook page for a provocative sign it posted six years ago in response to the July 2014 homicide of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who was placed in a chokehold by an NYPD officer investigating the sale of loose cigarettes. Garner was seen on video struggling to repeatedly say ""I can't breathe,"" a phrase that became ubiquitous at Black Lives Matter demonstrations. ""I can breathe. I obey the law,"" the electronic sign blared outside Rivoli's Italian & Seafood Restaurant on Fischer Boulevard in December 2014. The eatery has since closed and reopened with a new name in a new location. But the old sign has come back to haunt them as the nation's attention is on a new police killing: 46-year-old George Floyd was seen on video gasping for breath on Monday as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than seven minutes and distressed bystanders pleaded with officers to help. New Jersey-raised comedian John Poveromo on Wednesday resurfaced a picture of the Rivoli's 2014 sign. ""We’re all trying to do our best to help small businesses during this time but let’s make sure we’re helping the ones that deserve it,"" Poveromo said. ""Besides their family serving s*** food to the public since they first opened, being Anti-Vax and sharing 'plandemic' propaganda since we’ve been quarantined, the Rivolis first went public as garbage human beings in 2016 by exploiting the death of Eric Garner and are not worth your time or money during this pandemic."" Riv's Toms River Hub responded Thursday afternoon by saying that ""what was done to George Floyd on Monday is a disgrace and there is NO way we support that. The post that is circulating right now is from over 6 years and if I could go back in time I wouldn’t posted that on my signage. Again, we apologize."" The restaurant owner did not immediately return New Jersey 101.5's request Thursday evening for further comment. Some reacted to the apology with forgiveness. ""Tony Rivoli is a great man who runs a great business,"" one person wrote. ""We’ve all made mistakes in the past and for most of us we were lucky there wasn’t social media."" But others found it hard to swallow. ""You only apologized because it went viral,"" another person said. ""Why didn’t you apologize 6 years ago? You’re only sorry because it’s hitting you where it hurts... your wallet!"" Poveromo took another dig: Restaurateur Tony Rivoli also opened Rivoli's Grill & Chill in Howell. The video of Floyd's killing has prompted the Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor to call for criminal charges against the officers involved. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI said they are investigating after President Donald Trump tweeted in support of a swift probe. Police said Floyd had matched the description of someone who tried to use a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. In addition to demonstrations across the country this week, the death has also incited several days of civil unrest and sporadic looting in St. Paul and Minneapolis, with the governor calling on the National Guard on Thursday to control the violence.

Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance.""

State Sen. Ron Rice, D-Essex, went as far as to call for the death penalty for the officer who killed George Floyd by kneeling on the gasping man's neck for several minutes. In widely circulated videos of the arrest, Officer Derek Chauvin is seen pressing down on Floyd as other officers restrain him. Floyd repeatedly complains that he can't breathe and bystanders plead with police to help him. Floyd's death sparked violent protests and unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The precinct station in the area where Floyd was arrested was set on fire Thursday night. The four police officers involved in the Floyd arrest were fired but they have not been charged with a crime. “I think we watched a murder unfold on video,"" Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki said Thursday. The chief said he would make sure his officers are trained ""to have the knowledge and ability to navigate these situations."" Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said Floyd's death was ""deeply troubling and indefensible"" and the video revealed ""a startling lack of humanity by the police officers involved.""

""Our officers have managed the added responsibility of enforcing significant restrictions on our normal activities with sensitivity to the stress that our residents are experiencing in the midst of this public health crisis,"" Coffina said. Rice, a black former Newark police officer, told InsiderNJ.com that what he saw on video of the incident ""was clearly murder"" and that Chauvin ""deserves the gas chamber."" “I don’t care what color you are.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning fast food restaurant, Friday, May 29, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

His death has led to massive protests across Minneapolis and the country, at times turning violent, with clashes between law enforcement and protesters. Friday's protest was largely peaceful, but marked by verbal confrontations between some protesters and police. At least initially, there were few arrests. In one case early on it took at least two officers to subdue a demonstrator who they held to the pavement and cuffed. Anger over the Minneapolis killing was evident as some protesters made their way out of Foley Square, to a local police precinct, and eventually down Canal Street shouting “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” and “I am a revolutionary!” Some held up signs of past police brutality victims: Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. At one point someone spray painted ""we have nothing to lose but our chains"" on the fountain at Foley Square. Later in the Manhattan protest, demonstrators blocked traffic at the intersection of Centre and Broome streets. The group moved on to Houston and Lafayette, some of them kneeling while blocking traffic in both directions.

Chauvin and the three others officers involved were fired Tuesday. By Friday afternoon, Chauvin was arrested. He was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. An investigation into the other officers was ongoing. During Friday's protest in Manhattan, a robotic announcement from the police kept repeating, warning demonstrators to get out of the street or face arrest. “I don’t want my son to be scared of you,” one demonstrator said to a line of police officers. ""Let’s us sit on your neck... any volunteers?” an organizer with a megaphone said to police across the street from the demonstration.

Floyd, 46, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck for several minutes while the black man was handcuffed, in an incident captured on video and replayed around the world. Chauvin was arrested Friday on murder and manslaughter charges, while three other police officers who were at the scene remain free while under investigation, Minnesota authorities said Friday. All four officers were fired earlier this week. Story continues below the gallery. “People are very, very angry,” said Lawrence Hamm, the head of the People’s Organization for Progress, a Newark-based social justice group, and a longtime civil rights activist. “You’d have to have a pretty cold heart not to be upset about it.” “Police officers do these types of things because there is a certain degree of confidence that they will get away with them,” Hamm added. “It happens because of racism – not just one person’s racism, but institutional racism.” The arrest came after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation, including in New York's Foley Square on Friday evening. Demonstrators planned to take to the streets of Newark, Paterson and Englewood on Saturday.

(Photo: Seth Harrison - The Journal News - USA TODAY Network) The officer seen pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck had 18 prior complaints filed against him but only two ended in discipline from the department including official letters of reprimand, according to a CNN report. The death was another example of one officer's actions giving all police a bad name, said Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton, the first African American elected to that position. Bergen sheriff: 'Unacceptable' ""I’m pretty sure if you poll law enforcement throughout this nation they’ll say that’s undoubtedly unacceptable,"" he said on Friday. ""It’s definitely a black eye to law enforcement, and it highlights societal concerns.” The People’s Organization for Progress planned to hold a demonstration Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Abraham Lincoln statute at 12 Springfield Ave. at the corner of West Market Street in Newark. Hamm said Saturday’s protest was being called with specific demands: The immediate arrest of all officers at the scene, charging them with murder and conspiracy and appointment of a special prosecutor. ""I’m not encouraging or condoning violence. We are gathering tomorrow to make a statement,"" he said, adding the nation needed to change laws around police behavior. People gather in Foley Square in lower Manhattan May 29, 2020 to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier this week. (Photo: Seth Harrison/The Journal News) Activists in Paterson’s African American community planned a vigil on the steps of the main library. “We want to make a statement that we’re not standing for this,” said Jamie Bland of Paterson, one of the organizers of the event, being conducted in conjunction with Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. “If you want to be a cop, be a cop for public safety. We don’t need a cop for police brutality.” Paterson activist Bilal Hakeem said police misconduct can’t be addressed simply by firing or prosecuting the offenders. “Firing someone – that’s just cosmetic reform,” Hakeem said, “we need structural change.” Hakeem said police departments need zero-tolerance policies protecting the public from excessive force. Strict residency requirements for law enforcement would prevent police departments from becoming “occupying forces,” he said. “If that officer who killed Mr. Floyd lived next door to him, the results would have been totally different,” Hakeem said. ‘Can’t go out without fear’ Junius “Jeff” Carter, president of the Bergen County NAACP, said the death in Minneapolis was a symptom of injustices that have long occurred in the U.S. He cited a string of recent incidents, including one on Sunday when a white woman called police on a black man who asked her to leash her dog in Central Park. He recounted, too, the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Alabama in March after officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. He was pained, he said, after two men shot and killed jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia this February, but no arrests were made until two months later following public outcry. “It’s not just Minneapolis,” Carter said. “It's constant injustice being seen where black men are under attack. To be a black man in America today is tough. “My kids and other people’s kids, regardless of their education, can’t go out without fear of one of these instances happening,"" he said. ""They can’t go jogging. They can’t sleep in their own bed.” In New Jersey, Floyd's death was a reminder of the state's own painful history with police brutality, including a slew of excessive force complaints against police officers in Paterson and Newark. Paterson has paid out millions of dollars in settlements over brutality complaints. Last year, six city officers pleaded guilty following an FBI corruption investigation – three of whom admitted to using excessive force on people they apprehended. In Newark, advocates have pushed for the creation of a Civilian Complaint Review Board to investigate allegations of police misconduct, but the Newark police union has opposed the measure. The case is currently before the New Jersey Supreme Court. A two-year investigation by the Asbury Park Press found that New Jersey governments, from the smallest towns to some of the largest cities, spent more than $42 million in the last decade to quietly settle cases ofdeaths, physical abuses and sexual misconduct at the hands of cops. Many of the officers involved in these incidents remained on the street, the findings showed. NYC police stream: George Floyd's death sparks protest at Foley Square Investigation: Dead, beaten, abused: New Jersey fails to stop police brutality NJ officials speak out Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday said he, too, felt the Minnesota case was a reflection of “systematic racism.” “George Floyd should be alive today, not just as a matter of principle or justice, but as a matter of human dignity,” Murphy said at a news conference. “His life mattered as much as mine or my wife’s or any of our kids or yours. Too many times have we gotten a national wake-up call and then gone about doing nothing about it.” Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, in a statement, said New Jersey has taken steps toward accountability, citing an ""Excellence in Policing"" policy put in place in December that mandates changes to the use of force in arrests and better police training. The state launched a pilot program to document the use of force in an online database and now requires a grand jury investigation when a civilian dies in police custody. ""Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go not only in healing our nation’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that prevent all Americans from equally securing our country’s great promises,"" Grewal said. ""Now more than ever, we must redouble our commitment to building trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, especially those from historically marginalized communities."" George Floyd was murdered on tape and the officers who killed him still haven't been arrested.

On Friday, he weighed in on the violent demonstrations in Minneapolis, calling protesters ""thugs"" and warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter attached a warning to his tweet, saying that the president had violated its policies by glorifying violence. U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey responded with his own tweet: “George Floyd was murdered on tape and the officers who killed him still haven't been arrested. At a time when the president should be bringing this country together, he instead sends racist tweets inciting violence.

Community leaders said Floyd’s death, after he pleaded to breathe while lying on the ground handcuffed as a cop pressed his knee against his neck, resonate among African-Americans who have been mistreated by law enforcement officers. “We want to make a statement that we're not standing for this,” said Jamie Bland of Paterson, one of the organizers of the event, being conducted in conjunction with Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. “If you want to be a cop, be a cop for public safety. We don’t need a cop for police brutality.” Rev. Kenneth Clayon, head of the Paterson area chapter of the NAACP, said the Floyd case underscored the fact that African-Americans still get mistreated in his country despite the gains produced by the civil rights movement more than 50 years ago. “What happened there is relevant in Paterson because it’s a continuation of the disregard for African-American life,” said Clayton, pastor of St. Luke’s Baptist Church on Carroll Street. Story continues after gallery Clayton said his own father was beaten by a Paterson police officer in a dispute during a traffic stop in 1985. About 22 years after that incident, the pastor said a Paterson officer berated him with profanity when he asked the cop to allow him to drive around a road construction site so he could get to his church. During the past decade, there have only been a handful of incidents between Paterson police officers and African-Americans that triggered any sustained community or outrage. “I’ve never seen anything like that here,” activist Corey Teague said of the video-recorded incident preceding Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. “That wasn’t a police officer, that was a demon with a badge,” Teague added, referring to Derek Chauvin, the cop who had his knee on Floyd’s neck. 'We need structural change': NJ leaders demand reform after death of George Floyd North Jersey: Rally set for Englewood following death of George Floyd Chauvin was fired immediately after the incident and on Friday he was arrested and charged with murder. Paterson activist Bilal Hakeem said problems like the one that happened in Minnesota can’t be addressed simply by firing or prosecuting the offenders. “Firing someone – that’s just cosmetic reform,” Hakeem said, “we need structural change.” Hakeem said police departments need zero-tolerance policies protecting the public from excessive force. He said law enforcement agencies need strict residency requirements to prevent police departments from becoming “occupying forces.” “If that officer who killed Mr. Floyd lived next door to him, the results would have been totally different,” Hakeem said. Hakeem said that when bad cops act like executioners it makes it more difficult for good officers. “The good officers get a bad rap when things like this happen,” he said. In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, rioting and looting broke out in Minneapolis. Organziers of Saturday’s event in Paterson said they plan to keep things peaceful. Teague said the event will adhere with social-distancing called for during the coronavirus crisis. “We’re planning a demonstration that will keep everybody safe,” he said.

In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza.

One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Later in the evening, what had been a tense situation turned worse. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter a police cruiser. At another location near the arena, a shouting mob of protesters, some wearing helmets and carrying makeshift shields, advanced on officers shouting and throwing objects, and police retaliated with batons and arrests, leaving the roadway strewn with debris.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) (Photo: Frank Franklin II, AP) Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take them away. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The demonstrations were held in defiance of a ban on gatherings, imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed thousands of New Yorkers including dozens of members of the NYPD. Saturday: Rally set for Englewood following death of George Floyd Rally: Paterson looking to show solidarity in George Floyd case on Saturday “I voted in every election, city, state, national, and I always read the news, but it’s been decades and nothing has changed, so I don’t know how much these protests help but I know everything else I’ve done hasn’t ... for me it’s rage and exhaustion” one protester, Lucy Saintcyr, said as she headed home on the bus. Protests around George Floyd’s death have taken place around the country and were not quelled by the news Friday that the Minneapolis officer recorded kneeling on his neck would face criminal charges. “Our country has a sickness,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those demonstrating earlier in the day in lower Manhattan. “We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” New York Civil Liberties Union Legal Director Christopher Dunn blamed the police department for provoking the confrontations in Brooklyn.

If he’s serious about his demands for accountability in Minnesota, he needs to show leadership here in New York City,” he said in a statement. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier in the day on Friday said he stood with the Minnesota protesters. “Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes. And the demand is for justice,” Cuomo said. Story continues after gallery Anticipating demonstrations Friday afternoon, De Blasio said police officers had been told to respect peaceful protest, but he also had a message for demonstrators: “If you are angry with the government, if you are angry with the elected leaders, direct that anger to all of us, because if we haven’t done enough, we are the ones who should be held responsible,” he said. “But the police officer in front of you is a working man or woman just trying to do their job.” Update: Got her permission with a fuck yeah. The cop pushed her so hard at Barclays & she flung back. She is tiny. Now she’s in the ER after a serious seizure. I’m waiting for updates but have to wait outside because of COVID-19.

Police had barricaded numerous entry points to the facility. Protesters faced the police line yelling chants, waving signs and at times hurling insults. Eventually, the group slowly dispersed. Michael Wilson, an organizer with the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice, attributed the destruction to crowd anger. “A car burned down there and stuff, you stick around tonight, you might see a whole lot of things burned up, it’s just anger,” Wilson said. “It doesn’t replace the young man saying, ‘I can’t breathe.’ All you’re seeing is a reaction to what the police are doing, that’s all this is, it’s not bad, it’s not good, it’s just a reaction. If the capitalists lose a whole lot tonight or tomorrow, we don’t care, we really don’t care, it’s the price they pay for the way they treat us.” He said the protests will not stop as long as police departments can hire officers who sport Nazi tattoos or are a part of extremist groups. At 5:30, the Philadelphia Police Department tweeted that criminal acts and vandalism would not be tolerated and Mayor Jim Kenney asked protesters to go home. They did not. A crowd remained gathered near City Hall as car fires continued to burn. Businesses in the area were vandalized or broken into. The Starbucks kiosk at Dilworth Park was also set on fire. Police officers sprayed protesters from inside a SWAT van, and were pelted with orange traffic cones and bottles in return. Additional protests are planned in other parts of the state throughout the weekend. In an earlier statement, the governor encouraged people to speak out against the racial injustices happening in the country, but also asked people to stay safe and peaceful. The peaceful protests earlier were touching showings of our collective grief. The anger being displayed now cannot continue. Please have respect and dignity for each other and return home. https://t.co/Xem9btILWk — Jim #StayHomePHL Kenney (@PhillyMayor) May 30, 2020 An early calm A noon protest at City Hall began at Dilworth Plaza with participants socially distanced. They took a knee for nine minutes — a reference to the nine minutes a police officer’s knee allegedly pressed into Floyd’s neck — and observed moments of silence to show support for victims of police violence. Several hundred people gathered, with a small police presence on hand. As the racially mixed crowd grew larger, social distancing diminished. Chants during the peaceful protest included, “We deserve better,” “For our kids,” and “Our lives matter.” Organizers passed out bottled water and masks to crowd members. David Walker came to the event with his daughter and mother, who he said has been protesting since the 1960s. “Someone like George Floyd dies senselessly at the hands of the police,” Walker said, “you can’t just sit around. People have to get out, they have to take action, and most importantly they have to vote in November.” Walker believes the city is trying hard to make improvements to the police department and criminal justice system, but adds policies need to be put into practice. “It’s training, training, training. And then in any group, there’s bad actors. Those bad actors have to be held accountable,” Walker said. The noon event came together largely through social media efforts among concerned citizens. One of the organizers, Josh Yeboah, called on City Council to vote against Kenney’s budget, saying it gives too much money to police at a time when there’s a need for more social services. “It’s your tax dollars being spent. Shouldn’t you get to choose and decide what it pays for?” Yeboah said, reading a prepared statement to members of the media ahead of the noon demonstration.  A little after 1 p.m., protesters began to disperse the area around City Hall and started making their way up JFK Boulevard toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art to attend the second demonstration of the day, set for 2 p.m. 9 minutes of silent kneeling has ended. Protesters have begun chants of “no justice no peace” and “I can’t breath.” pic.twitter.com/IytA1oF1by — Zachariah Hughes (@ZachHughesNews) May 30, 2020 The second event, dubbed “Solidarity Against Police Terrorism,” taking place on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art was organized by Black Lives Matter Philly and Philly for REAL Justice. Its organizers described the Art Museum event as “a solidarity action in support of Minneapolis, and the many other uprisings” that occurred this week in Louisville, Atlanta and other cities across the country protesting police violence against Black individuals. Participants in this event were asked to wear masks to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus, as Philadelphia is still in Gov. Tom Wolf’s “red” phase of the stay-at-home orders. Protesters said they were tired of still having to rally against police violence. Danyca Lok said she has been going to Black Lives Matter protests for years, going back to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. She held a sign that said, “My friends shouldn’t fear for their lives when we go out.” “I’ve experienced that countless times … every time me and my friends went out, we always got followed by a cop, or we always had to take a different route somewhere because I have felt like my friends’ lives were in danger.” She said nothing will change unless people keep protesting and speaking out. She is 18 and will be voting for the first time this year. Myia Bonifacino said, “It’s ridiculous that we have to even sit out here and do this, why are we different than everyone else … what, because of the color of our skin?” Her sign read, “I can’t believe I’m still protesting this [expletive.]” “I think everyone’s sick and tired of it … we should be able to just live a normal life, just like everybody else, like there’s absolutely no reason that we have to go out of our way to fight for simple things.” Yalon Dirickson-Martin, who is 55 and came with her daughter, said she hopes more people will listen to what the Black community says. “Unfortunately, some of America don’t believe what we’re saying until they see it on video, but we’re saying the same thing, we’re saying, ‘We need to breathe,’” she said. “I see people of all colors and races and socioeconomic levels all joining together because people, we are just sick and tired of this.” Michael Samuels said he also has been to many Black Lives Matter protests over the years, and will keep going until the police stop taking Black lives. “This ain’t ending till we get what we want,” he said. “This isn’t just a week or a month thing, or two months, three months, we’re going to do this for a year if we have to, 10 years, we’re going to keep pushing.” The Art Museum protest drew a larger crowd than the morning’s City Hall gathering, with less social distancing. It attracted a larger police presence, as well. The mood changes About 3 p.m., the crowd began marching down the Parkway toward City Hall then along North Broad Street. Some businesses and buildings were vandalized with spray paint along the way. No one appeared to be leading the crowd. The crowd stopped at Broad and Vine streets, near the entrance to I-676 — which was blocked by police vehicles. Some protesters were standing on top of the parked police cars, as well as spray-painting them. State police officers in riot gear were on the scene. One of the vandalized parked police cars was set on fire and was burning with large flames. Police set a wide perimeter around the vehicle at Broad and Vine streets. Loud booms were heard by reporters on the scene, what appeared to be the car exploding.

At one point, a protester stood on top of a car and pleaded with people to stop, saying, “We are not here to fight the police, we are not here to hurt anyone.” The Philadelphia police and Pennsylvania state troopers separated the crowd, surrounding them into smaller groups with raised batons and bicycles, and slowly forced people to disperse. In a Twitter thread Saturday morning, Mayor Kenney commented on the recent murders of Black Americans — including George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. “You should not have to bear witness to the killing of yet another unarmed Black person,” Kenney wrote. “You should not have to feel as though society believes your lives are less valuable than white Americans. And you should not fear for your lives — or for your loved ones — when leaving the house.” In the midst of a global pandemic, America’s original sin of racism has not gone dormant. It has claimed the lives of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. — Jim #StayHomePHL Kenney (@PhillyMayor) May 30, 2020 The mayor added that he understands the “need to stand up and make your voices heard,” but pleaded with participants to protest peacefully, social distance as much as possible, and wear masks. Large protests over Floyd’s death — as well as police brutality and racial violence in America — started Tuesday in Minneapolis and have grown to cities nationwide. Almost all protesters were wearing masks, some even brought boxes of masks to pass out to people who wanted one. Floyd, 46, died in law enforcement custody on Monday after police arrested him based on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed at a Minneapolis convenience store. A video of his arrest, taken by a witness, shows Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck. In the video, Floyd pleads with the officers that he can’t breathe. Chauvin was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Protests have been held in Minneapolis daily, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the National Guard on Saturday, saying the unrest is “no longer, in any way, about the murder of George Floyd.” Protest hits Wilmington In Wilmington, protesters shut down a section of I-95. After demonstrators spoke with Delaware State Police, many moved off the highway by mid-afternoon. Earlier in the day protesters broke windows on Market Street between Sixth and Seventh streets. A Starbucks at Seventh and Market had all its windows smashed out. The Starbucks has been closed since the end of March because of the coronavirus. The location is the former site of the Wilmington campus of Delaware State University. Across the street, wait staff from the restaurant Bardea took brooms to break the shattered glass. The restaurant had just reopened after almost two months due to coronavirus precautions. It had just restarted sidewalk dining A beauty supply store next to WHYY’s Wilmington newsroom had its window shattered as well. The Associated Press contributed reporting.",0.0

Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia's capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,"" Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. ""There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. ""We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one whose tooth was knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. An LAPD spokesman told The Associated Press they were still tallying arrests. “I believe in our city. L.A. is strong enough to stand for justice and walk in love,” Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted, cautioning ""violence and vandalism hurts all.” San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city's officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s death. “It was a horrible injustice,” he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Two people were arrested during overnight riots in which protesters set fires throughout downtown and smashed storefront windows, police said, but arrest details were immediately available. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left Portland to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?”",0.0

1621049766,2020-05-30 13:38:56,"Newark residents, citing '67, plead for peace as protestors march",https://nj1015.com/newark-residents-citing-67-plead-for-peace-as-protestors-march-in-city/,en,False,,68099,NJ 101.5,http://nj1015.com/#spider,"NEWARK — The mayor of the state's largest city said that he was offended at suggestions that a demonstration planned for Saturday afternoon would lead to violence. Standing on the steps of City Hall while wearing a mask and gloves, Mayor Ras Baraka said that he would be joining the march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, which is protesting against the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. The death of the unarmed and restrained black man by a white officer has sparked civil unrest in the Twin Cities as well as as other cities across the country. Baraka, who is black, said the demonstration, which was to step off 1 p.m. near the Lincoln statue on Springfield Avenue, would be as peaceful as any other previous POP event in the city. ""The People's Organization for Progress have been having protests in our city for decades without incident, without issue, all of the time,"" Baraka said. ""The terrible thing is we have to fight two pandemics at one time,"" he said. ""We have to fight the pandemic of coronavirus that unfortunately is killing black people. It's killing everybody but it is killing us the most. And we have to fight the pandemic of racism and white supremacy."" POP leader Larry Hamm said some people ""would love to have something happen today that would take attention away from the cause for which we are marching and put it on chaos and confusion."" ""It's all right to be outraged. It's all right to be angry about what happened. And I'm going to say something else: It is mentally unhealthy to repress that anger and that outrage,"" Hamm said. ""The difference is we must take our outrage and take our anger and take our righteous indignation and turn it into energy to organize our people to fight against the forces of racism and oppression here in the United States."" Demonstrations elsewhere in New Jersey were also being planned in Englewood, Paterson and Freehold Borough. Demonstration in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Joe Hewes) Demonstrators near Route 9 in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Townsquare Media NJ)m Demonstrators near Route 9 in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Townsquare Media NJ) In Minneapolis, fires and violence continued Saturday as Gov. Tim Walz said that even with the help of 500 National Guardsmen, authorities did not have enough manpower to make arrests. The Pentagon, meanwhile, put Army police on alert in case they are needed to be mobilized. Violence on Friday night also erupted in Detroit, where a man was shot dead, as well as in Atlanta and New York City. Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Widely circulated videos show Chauvin kneeling on the neck of a restrained Floyd for about eight minutes while bystanders pleaded with police to help him. As word spread Friday night and Saturday morning of the Newark demonstration, some Newark residents took to social media to express concern that the situation would turn violent. ""Important note for folks NOT from Newark coming here today. This will be a PEACEFUL protest in Newark,"" city school board member A'Dorian Murray-Thomas said on Twitter. ""Those of us who live, organize and work here will not tolerate y’all coming here exploiting or destroying a city we’ve worked so hard to rebuild. Period. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd."" A resident wrote on the City Hall's Facebook page: ""I pray they don’t come here to destroy the city. Newark don’t need them doing this here."" Many commenters, as well as the mayor, referenced the four days of deadly and fiery unrest that rocked Newark in July 1967. Baraka, who refers to the '67 violence as the ""Newark Rebellion,"" noted that his father, poet Amiri Baraka, participated during demonstrations in the midst of that week of chaos and was beaten by a white police officer who had once been a classmate of his. The violence and rioting in 1967 was sparked after the brutal arrest of black cab driver John Smith, which became the subject of false rumors that he had been killed by police. The violence and destruction in Newark was not entirely perpetrated by rioters or angry protestors, however. To quell the rioting, Gov. Richard Hughes dispatched 3,000 National Guardsmen and 500 state troopers who ""joined the local police in an orgy of violent, brutal retaliation against black citizens and businesses,"" according to Rutgers University scholar Robert Curvin's history in ""Inside Newark: Decline, Rebellion and the Search for Transformation."" After black shopkeepers hung signs in front of their stores to indicate that they were black-owned, the businesses were shot up by police who thought ""it was unfair for black businesses to escape damage while white-owned businesses were being plundered,"" Curvin wrote. ""Law enforcement personnel had engaged in a deadly expression of white hatred, including the perverse irony of state police officers willfully damaging black-owned businesses, whose owners were the best example in the inner city of the hope of buying into the American dream."" The Governor's Select Commission on Civil Disorder, empaneled less than a month later, concluded that black residents had long been mistreated by city government and local police – and found that law enforcement's response to the unrest, particularly their use of firepower, was ""out of proportion."" The commission condemned the State Police and the National Guard for firing into black-owned businesses ""with no possible justification."" In the end, 24 black civilians, a white firefighter and a white police officer died in the violence, which caused $10 million in damage. A grand jury declined to indict any officers for the deaths they caused, instead commending them for ""courage and restraint."" Larry Hamm , of The People's Organization for Progress, on May 30, 2020. (Facebook video) Baraka said Saturday that the city is ""still trying to recover economically, socially, politically"" from that violence 50 years later. His administration is battling the police union in court over a Civilian Complaint Review Board, something that advocates first called for in the 1960s but was created by Baraka through executive order in 2015. Hamm pointed out that more than a thousand people were killed by police in the United States last year — more than killed by police in the United Kingdom over the course of the entire 20th Century. ""We don't hate all police. Every civil society has to have police. What we are saying is do your job but your job is not to be the judge and not to be the executioner,"" Hamm said. ""The good police need to stand up and speak up against the racist police that are killing our people."" Some law enforcement officials in New Jersey, meanwhile, have expressed outrage at the death of Floyd. The County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey on Saturday morning called the images of the death ""deeply disturbing"" and called on ""anyone who believes they have been victimized by a member of law enforcement as a result of bias or other improper behavior"" to contact their local police chief or county prosecutor. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday that the state ""will never tolerate the types of police practices that resulted in Mr. Floyd’s death."" Grewal touted the Excellence in Policing Initiative, rolled out in December to increase accountability and transparency in investigations of police misconduct. ""Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go not only in healing our nation’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that prevent all Americans from equally securing our country’s great promises,"" Grewal said. ""Now more than ever, we must redouble our commitment to building trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, especially those from historically marginalized communities.""

The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Monday sparked a firestorm of protests and riots throughout the country, with scenes of violence unfolding on social media and TV screens. In North Jersey though, the events were peaceful. A rally held under the scorching afternoon sun in Englewood drew a crowd of more than 1,000. The organizer of Englewood's protest, Ainsworth Minott, was adamant about the march remaining peaceful. Before its start, he instructed anyone with bad intentions to leave. Story continues below the gallery The tone was of unity. Bob Marley’s “One Love” played in the background. The protest began at Mackay Park and was followed by a march to the Englewood police station. It included a reading of 84 names of black people who had been killed in encounters with police. The names included Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Teaneck’s Phillip Pannell, a 16-year-old who was fatally shot 30 years ago, sparking riots in that town.

(Photo: Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey - USA TODAY NETWORK) Marchers wore masks and maintained social distance as they chanted, “Justice for George Floyd, no justice, no peace” and “I can’t breathe.” Englewood resident Karen Bronstein carried a sign that read “Racism is a white problem.” ""People who are black can only say so much. The problem is coming from the people that are white,"" said Bronstein. ""I had to be out here to show my support and heartbreak, rage, over what is still continuing in our country."" Protesters in Englewood were from diverse backgrounds, and there was a large number of young adults in their 20s. When Minott stood back to admire the crowd he said, ""this is a beautiful thing."" “Why is my blackness so weaponized in this country, and I’m here to combat that,” said John Robinson IV of Englewood. For Robinson, it was the first time seeing so many people who are not black getting behind the cause of equality for black people in America. “Racism is not a black problem, it takes everybody,” he said. Samuel Griffin, head coach of the Teaneck’s High School football team, came out with his young son. “I think it is important for him to know that he has no reason to be afraid of the police or cops if he is not breaking any laws, and that his rights matter,” Griffin said. Newark remained peaceful as well Saturday afternoon, with a crowd of at least 5,000 people who gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln at the foot of Newark's historic courthouse.

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (purple shirt) spoke during the protest.

""My children need to witness that their mother raised her voice in protest,"" said West Orange teacher Ashley Barnes. ""We need to tell our black men how we love them and care about them."" Protesters marched east on Market Street from the courthouse. There were occasional chants as they went. Police, who wore their standard uniform with masks to protect against COVID-19, silently orchestrated traffic around the moving crowd, blocking streets behind protesters and rerouting vehicles one street at a time as they moved. The rally was organized by The People's Organization for Progress, a citizen association working for racial, social and economic justice and community unity. Its members, in yellow shirts, circulated through the crowd, encouraging an orderly march, handing out markers and poster board to those who wanted to make signs, and distributing water to the thirsty standing in the 83-degree sun. On the courthouse steps, Hannah Smith and Jesse Grupper of Montclair held signs seeking ""justice for George Floyd."" ""There was a complete lack of respect for humanity,"" Smith said, referring to Floyd's killing. ""No one deserves that."" Rallies were also scheduled in Trenton, North Bergen, Burlington County, Morristown, Point Pleasant Beach and Asbury Park. In Englewood, Councilman Wayne Hamer, who is black and has two small sons, said, ""This is about supporting the whole initiative and supporting my family and bringing awareness to people who don't look like me and who don't think like me."" A police cruiser led off the march in the city, which concluded at the Englewood police station, where Phillip Pannell's sister, Natacha Pannell, wore a T-shirt honoring her brother. Pannell was 13 when her brother died. She has a 21-year-old son in college and said that’s why she was out at the march,still fighting for the same things. “My question is what do they want us to do? My question to authorities is what do they want us to do if our backs are up against the wall,” Pannell said. Marching is not enough, Pannell said, because “they are killing our kids."" More than 100 people gathered outside Paterson City Hall in the early afternoon for what organizers said would be a peace vigil in memory of George Floyd. But the gathering quickly turned into a protest over the January 2019 death of Jameek Lowery, the 27-year-old Paterson man who died in police custody after recording a frantic video at the city’s police headquarters, in which he said that cops wanted to kill him. Authorities last year said autopsy results revealed Lowery died from the interaction between drugs he took and a pre-existing medical condition. His sister, Jamilyha Lowery, told the protesters that George Floyd and her brother were the same because, “They both begged for their life and no one listened.” Paterson pastors, the Rev. Allan Boyer of Bethel A.M.E. Church and the Rev. Michael D. McDuffie of the Mighty Sons of God Fellowship Church, managed to quell the vociferous crowd by offering brief prayers for the family of Floyd and all those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.

""If my kids are not here to survive how are they going to be a teacher when they grow up, how are they going to get to do the stuff that they should do."" “Dr. King said that rioting is the voice of the unheard but you have to hear what else he said in that speech,” McDuffie stated. “Some people have an unorthodox way of communicating their pain.

1621118053,2020-05-30 15:52:34,SpaceX rocket ship blasts off into orbit with 2 Americans,https://whyy.org/articles/spacex-rocket-ship-blasts-off-into-orbit-with-2-americans/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era of commercial space travel and putting NASA back in the business of launching astronauts from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes.",0.0

Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said 13 police officers were injured in protests over the death of George Floyd that resulted in property damage and several burned cars. Outlaw reportedly also said civilians suffered injuries as well. A citywide curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. Police began enforcing the curfew and pushing lines of protesters away from Center City at about 9 p.m. Dressed in riot gear, they marched south down 15th street and used batons and shields to force protesters to retreat. Philadelphia police said shortly after 2 a.m. that 109 arrests were made, including 52 for curfew violations and 43 for looting or burglary. ""Only persons with essential duties will be permitted outdoors,"" Philadelphia police said in a tweet Saturday night. They’re moving the line south and threatening arrests #phillyprotestpic.twitter.com/hQGAi14Kix — Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) May 31, 2020 Hours before the curfew took effect, hundreds flooded city hall, damaging cars and spray painting messages on buildings, vehicles and the city block. “I watched three cars burn right here,” one message read. At least four cars were burned, and the statue of former controversial police commissioner and mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced. Protesters also broke windows at City Hall and damaged dozens of business near Chestnut Street, including a Foot Locker and Walgreens. A Starbucks outside City Hall was also set on fire. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday night signed a disaster emergency declaration to provide all necessary assistance to municipalities as they respond to the escalation of protests in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Gov. Wolf said. CLOSE Protests began peacefully but took a turn at night as crowds dispersed into Center City Philadelphia. This video contains explicit language. Delaware News Journal The declaration authorizes the Pennsylvania National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner to activate personnel and use resources ""as necessary to alleviate the danger to public health and safety caused by this emergency."" Philadelphia police said late Saturday night that an officer was “attempting to stop individuals in a vehicle who were involved in looting a business in the area of 7th and Chestnut” and was run over by the vehicle. The officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital and sustained a broken arm and other injuries. A burned police car sat out front of an Apple store on Walnut street between 16th and 17th, where many businesses were damaged. The Philadelphia Fire Department later responded to a three-alarm fire at 1700 Walnut, just northeast of Rittenhouse Park.

(Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) At 10:30 p.m., armored police vehicles used what appeared to be tear gas to disperse light crowds on Broad Street and more arrests were made. 'This is necessary' Two Philadelphia protests morphed into one early Saturday afternoon as thousands of marchers moved from a City Hall demonstration to a larger, Black Lives Matter-sanctioned gathering at the Philadelphia Art Museum. People, an overwhelming majority in masks, were met with a strong police presence as they gathered just after noon, with many more people still arriving as the day went on. Earlier in the day, there were chants of ""We will remain,'' with responses of ""Peaceful!'' from the gatherers. These were followed by chants of, ""No justice!'' ""No peace!'' Kevin Sellers of West Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek neighborhood, described racial climate in this country as being ""at a boiling point and the pot has boiled over.'' ""We are tired of the rhetoric and thoughts and prayers,"" said Sellers, who is black. ""Too many people, black men and women, have been killed at the hands of police and Eric Garner and George Floyd was caught on tape and still they take days and days and days to investigate and our patience has boiled over.''

She was taking pictures with her phone at 8:40 p.m., as she stood near the corner of Chestnut and 15 streets, where a trash can was on fire, the windows of a Wells Fargo busted and debris lay strewn west down the block. “This is what they have to do to be heard. I stand with them.” Ebony Franklin of Nicetown, who is black, and two friends were on hand passing out free water to rally attendees at the museum. ""It is really hot and we wanted to be supportive,'' she said. ""Everyone is tired and frustrated. This is something small that we can do. People have been coming to us and refilling our coolers all day.'' Nehemiah Whittley of Philadelphia is a performance artist who was lying flat on his back on the marble in front of the art museum. He said he wants people to remember that change can come through art. ""I want people to see a reflection in me and in the marble of change,'' he added. Beth Wright of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, brought her son, Daniel, who is 8. The white mother said she wanted to bring her son ""to teach him what to do when he sees something wrong, and this was wrong."" ""It's unjust,"" she said, fighting tears behind her mask. ""I want him to know that, and I want him to grow up in a better world."" She said her son's safety was her first priority, but the organizers, including Black Lives Matter, seemed to be intent on peaceful protests, which made her feel better about bringing her son on Saturday.

Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said 13 police officers were injured in protests over the death of George Floyd that resulted in property damage and several burned cars. Outlaw reportedly also said civilians suffered injuries as well. A citywide curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. Police began enforcing the curfew and pushing lines of protesters away from Center City at about 9 p.m. Dressed in riot gear, they marched south down 15th street and used batons and shields to force protesters to retreat. Philadelphia police said shortly after 2 a.m. that 109 arrests were made, including 52 for curfew violations and 43 for looting or burglary. ""Only persons with essential duties will be permitted outdoors,"" Philadelphia police said in a tweet Saturday night. They’re moving the line south and threatening arrests #phillyprotestpic.twitter.com/hQGAi14Kix — Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) May 31, 2020 Hours before the curfew took effect, hundreds flooded city hall, damaging cars and spray painting messages on buildings, vehicles and the city block. “I watched three cars burn right here,” one message read. At least four cars were burned, and the statue of former controversial police commissioner and mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced. Protesters also broke windows at City Hall and damaged dozens of business near Chestnut Street, including a Foot Locker and Walgreens. A Starbucks outside City Hall was also set on fire. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday night signed a disaster emergency declaration to provide all necessary assistance to municipalities as they respond to the escalation of protests in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Gov. Wolf said. CLOSE Protests began peacefully but took a turn at night as crowds dispersed into Center City Philadelphia. This video contains explicit language. Delaware News Journal The declaration authorizes the Pennsylvania National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner to activate personnel and use resources ""as necessary to alleviate the danger to public health and safety caused by this emergency."" Philadelphia police said late Saturday night that an officer was “attempting to stop individuals in a vehicle who were involved in looting a business in the area of 7th and Chestnut” and was run over by the vehicle. The officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital and sustained a broken arm and other injuries. A burned police car sat out front of an Apple store on Walnut street between 16th and 17th, where many businesses were damaged. The Philadelphia Fire Department later responded to a three-alarm fire at 1700 Walnut, just northeast of Rittenhouse Park.

(Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) At 10:30 p.m., armored police vehicles used what appeared to be tear gas to disperse light crowds on Broad Street and more arrests were made. 'This is necessary' Two Philadelphia protests morphed into one early Saturday afternoon as thousands of marchers moved from a City Hall demonstration to a larger, Black Lives Matter-sanctioned gathering at the Philadelphia Art Museum. People, an overwhelming majority in masks, were met with a strong police presence as they gathered just after noon, with many more people still arriving as the day went on. Earlier in the day, there were chants of ""We will remain,'' with responses of ""Peaceful!'' from the gatherers. These were followed by chants of, ""No justice!'' ""No peace!'' Kevin Sellers of West Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek neighborhood, described racial climate in this country as being ""at a boiling point and the pot has boiled over.'' ""We are tired of the rhetoric and thoughts and prayers,"" said Sellers, who is black. ""Too many people, black men and women, have been killed at the hands of police and Eric Garner and George Floyd was caught on tape and still they take days and days and days to investigate and our patience has boiled over.'' In South Jersey: Camden residents, elected officials march against police brutality In New York City: NYC protest live stream: Protests over George Floyd's death continue Saturday After a morning of peaceful protesting, a state police vehicle was reportedly set on fire near Broad and Vine streets and protesters stopped drivers on I-95. “This is necessary,” said Natasha Goskowsky, an Atlantic City, NJ native who came to Philadelphia to protest. She was taking pictures with her phone at 8:40 p.m., as she stood near the corner of Chestnut and 15 streets, where a trash can was on fire, the windows of a Wells Fargo busted and debris lay strewn west down the block. “This is what they have to do to be heard. I stand with them.” Ebony Franklin of Nicetown, who is black, and two friends were on hand passing out free water to rally attendees at the museum. ""It is really hot and we wanted to be supportive,'' she said. ""Everyone is tired and frustrated. This is something small that we can do. People have been coming to us and refilling our coolers all day.'' Nehemiah Whittley of Philadelphia is a performance artist who was lying flat on his back on the marble in front of the art museum. He said he wants people to remember that change can come through art. ""I want people to see a reflection in me and in the marble of change,'' he added. Beth Wright of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, brought her son, Daniel, who is 8. The white mother said she wanted to bring her son ""to teach him what to do when he sees something wrong, and this was wrong."" ""It's unjust,"" she said, fighting tears behind her mask. ""I want him to know that, and I want him to grow up in a better world."" She said her son's safety was her first priority, but the organizers, including Black Lives Matter, seemed to be intent on peaceful protests, which made her feel better about bringing her son on Saturday. Police, too, she said, ""seem friendly and not adversarial,"" adding to her sense of security.

USA TODAY TOMS RIVER - As outrage spanned the nation over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis earlier this week, the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office and Sheriff’s Office issued separate statements this weekend to assure the public that they held themselves and their law enforcement officers to a higher standard of conduct. “The images of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis are deeply disturbing,” read the statement posted on the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Facebook page on Saturday, which had been prepared by the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey. “As county prosecutors entrusted with the solemn responsibility of acting as the chief law enforcement officer in our respective counties, we recognize that so much of law enforcement’s relationship with the community is built upon trust,” the statement said. “We trust the members of our community to follow the law and cooperate with our efforts to enforce it; our community has the right to trust that they will be treated fairly and justly by the officers who serve them.” On Sunday, the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office posted the same statement from the state group.

No officers under our roof condone this conduct or would allow this to go on. We are trained to save lives, not take them.

(Photo: Asbury Park Press) New Jersey is home to some of the finest law enforcement officers in the nation, said the statement from the County Prosecutors Association posted on the Facebook page of the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office. “The County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey is committed to ensuring that members of our local, county and state police forces provide fair treatment and justice to all our residents,” the statement said. “Anyone who believes they have been victimized by a member of law enforcement as a result of bias or other improper behavior is encouraged to take the matter up with that officer’s chief, or contact their County Prosecutor’s Office directly so their complaint can be thoroughly investigated.” The statement continued that state Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal had issued a comprehensive package of policy initiatives to reinforce and clarify New Jersey’s commitment to excellence in policing. “These statewide reforms are intended to promote the culture of professionalism, accountability and transparency that are hallmarks of New Jersey’s best law enforcement agencies,” the statement said. “Through Attorney General Grewal’s ‘Excellence in Policing Initiative,’ the state is building a national model for strengthening accountability and trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. “In closing, we will keep George Floyd, his family and friends in our thoughts and prayers. In addition to being county prosecutors, we are all part of the citizenry we serve and as such, we pledge our continued commitment to ensuring justice for each and every resident of our state, to holding all offenders, police officers included, accountable for their crimes, and improving relations between law enforcement and the community,” the statement concluded.

Elected officials and religious leaders also took part in the peaceful demonstration, which began as a grass-roots protest to the police-involved death of a Minneapolis man on Memorial Day. Meanwhile, more South Jersey law enforcement agencies released statements critical of the Minneapolis police action, which has sparked sometimes violent protests across the country.

""It was heartbreaking to see the video,"" said Figueroa. “But I’m not going to say I was surprised. It’s been going on for a long time,” she said. ""The people of Minneapolis do not stand alone,"" added Daniela Martinez, who attended the demonstration with her 7-year-old niece Angelee Rodriguez. Both carried hand-written signs on brightly colored posters. “Black lives matter,” said a bright pink sign held by Angelee, while her aunt's neon green poster read “#georgefloyd.” The protest's organizer, hair salon operator Yolanda ""Yonnie"" Deaver, initially expected participants would come from her social-media followers. But then a friend on the police force asked if she could walk, too, Deaver recounted Sunday. ""I said, 'Of course!'"" said Deaver, who heard next from a lieutenant and then from Chief Joseph Wysocki. “I told them my message was solidarity, justice for George Floyd and black lives matter,” said Deaver. ""He (Wysocki) told me he felt the same way I did,” said Deaver.

""He was chanting 'Black Lives Matter,'"" she noted. ""It turned out really nice. I felt so moved and inspired,"" Deaver said of the march, which began outside her business, Prissy Chic Hair Company on Mount Ephraim Avenue near Thurman Street. Wysocki and members of the city's clergy had decried Floyd's death at a press conference on Thursday, where speakers praised the local department's emphasis on de-escalation techniques and community relations. In a statement Sunday, Wysocki said the department's participation in the march ""was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden."" As part of that approach, the police department offered beverages and masks to marchers. It also stationed a Mr. Softee truck outside the downtown police station to distribute free ice cream treats to demonstrators. Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr. said the officers' role in the ""unity walk"" reflected a focus on ""direct interaction, relationship building and community policing."" Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change. pic.twitter.com/L1GpBkzmU0 — Donald Norcross (@DonaldNorcross) May 30, 2020 That emphasis was implemented after the county department's creation in mid-2013 amidst controversy and allegations of union-busting. It replaced a smaller municipal police force that had been depleted by layoffs. The march also grew to include Mayor Francisco ""Frank"" Moran and Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, as well as other local leaders. ""Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change,"" Norcross tweeted after the event. Deaver said she organized her first-ever protest march after deciding a trip to demonstrate in Minneapolis would be too dangerous. ""My father told me to always follow my heart,” she said. “If we stand together and stop being so divided, we can accomplish anything,” Deaver continued. “Love will always conquer.” Separately, Acting Camden County Prosecutor Jill Mayer said Floyd's death ""undermines'' the relationship between law enforcement and the community. ""It also highlights that there is much more work to be done and it cannot be accomplished by staying silent,"" she said. Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins said he was ""disheartened and disgusted"" by Floyd's death. He said the township's officers were directed to watch the video ""and reflect on what was done wrong."" ""I asked all of the officers, dispatchers, and civilian staff to reflect on 'why we do what we do' as servants to our community. We will honor the memory of Mr. Floyd by striving to do even better,"" Harkins said. Similar statements were released Thursday and Friday by chiefs for the Cherry Hill, Winslow and Camden County police departments. Also Saturday, prosecutor's offices across South Jersey joined in releasing a statement that described Floyd's death as ""deeply disturbing."" ""Our community has the right to trust that they will be treated fairly and justly by the officers who serve them,"" said the statement from the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey.

1621171557,2020-05-30 13:38:56,"Newark residents, citing '67, plead for peace as protestors march in city",https://wobm.com/newark-residents-citing-67-plead-for-peace-as-protestors-march-in-city/,en,False,,442196,wobm.com,http://wobm.com/,"NEWARK — The mayor of the state's largest city said that he was offended at suggestions that a demonstration planned for Saturday afternoon would lead to violence. Standing on the steps of City Hall while wearing a mask and gloves, Mayor Ras Baraka said that he would be joining the march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, which is protesting against the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. The death of the unarmed and restrained black man by a white officer has sparked civil unrest in the Twin Cities as well as as other cities across the country. Baraka, who is black, said the demonstration, which was to step off 1 p.m. near the Lincoln statue on Springfield Avenue, would be as peaceful as any other previous POP event in the city. ""The People's Organization for Progress have been having protests in our city for decades without incident, without issue, all of the time,"" Baraka said. ""The terrible thing is we have to fight two pandemics at one time,"" he said. ""We have to fight the pandemic of coronavirus that unfortunately is killing black people. It's killing everybody but it is killing us the most. And we have to fight the pandemic of racism and white supremacy."" POP leader Larry Hamm said some people ""would love to have something happen today that would take attention away from the cause for which we are marching and put it on chaos and confusion."" ""It's all right to be outraged. It's all right to be angry about what happened. And I'm going to say something else: It is mentally unhealthy to repress that anger and that outrage,"" Hamm said. ""The difference is we must take our outrage and take our anger and take our righteous indignation and turn it into energy to organize our people to fight against the forces of racism and oppression here in the United States."" Demonstrations elsewhere in New Jersey were also being planned in Englewood, Paterson and Freehold Borough. Demonstration in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Joe Hewes) Demonstrators near Route 9 in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Townsquare Media NJ)m Demonstrators near Route 9 in Freehold on May 30, 2020. (Townsquare Media NJ) In Minneapolis, fires and violence continued Saturday as Gov. Tim Walz said that even with the help of 500 National Guardsmen, authorities did not have enough manpower to make arrests. The Pentagon, meanwhile, put Army police on alert in case they are needed to be mobilized. Violence on Friday night also erupted in Detroit, where a man was shot dead, as well as in Atlanta and New York City. Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Widely circulated videos show Chauvin kneeling on the neck of a restrained Floyd for about eight minutes while bystanders pleaded with police to help him. As word spread Friday night and Saturday morning of the Newark demonstration, some Newark residents took to social media to express concern that the situation would turn violent. ""Important note for folks NOT from Newark coming here today. This will be a PEACEFUL protest in Newark,"" city school board member A'Dorian Murray-Thomas said on Twitter. ""Those of us who live, organize and work here will not tolerate y’all coming here exploiting or destroying a city we’ve worked so hard to rebuild. Period. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd."" A resident wrote on the City Hall's Facebook page: ""I pray they don’t come here to destroy the city. Newark don’t need them doing this here."" Many commenters, as well as the mayor, referenced the four days of deadly and fiery unrest that rocked Newark in July 1967. Baraka, who refers to the '67 violence as the ""Newark Rebellion,"" noted that his father, poet Amiri Baraka, participated during demonstrations in the midst of that week of chaos and was beaten by a white police officer who had once been a classmate of his. The violence and rioting in 1967 was sparked after the brutal arrest of black cab driver John Smith, which became the subject of false rumors that he had been killed by police. The violence and destruction in Newark was not entirely perpetrated by rioters or angry protestors, however. To quell the rioting, Gov. Richard Hughes dispatched 3,000 National Guardsmen and 500 state troopers who ""joined the local police in an orgy of violent, brutal retaliation against black citizens and businesses,"" according to Rutgers University scholar Robert Curvin's history in ""Inside Newark: Decline, Rebellion and the Search for Transformation."" After black shopkeepers hung signs in front of their stores to indicate that they were black-owned, the businesses were shot up by police who thought ""it was unfair for black businesses to escape damage while white-owned businesses were being plundered,"" Curvin wrote. ""Law enforcement personnel had engaged in a deadly expression of white hatred, including the perverse irony of state police officers willfully damaging black-owned businesses, whose owners were the best example in the inner city of the hope of buying into the American dream."" The Governor's Select Commission on Civil Disorder, empaneled less than a month later, concluded that black residents had long been mistreated by city government and local police – and found that law enforcement's response to the unrest, particularly their use of firepower, was ""out of proportion."" The commission condemned the State Police and the National Guard for firing into black-owned businesses ""with no possible justification."" In the end, 24 black civilians, a white firefighter and a white police officer died in the violence, which caused $10 million in damage. A grand jury declined to indict any officers for the deaths they caused, instead commending them for ""courage and restraint."" Larry Hamm , of The People's Organization for Progress, on May 30, 2020. (Facebook video) Baraka said Saturday that the city is ""still trying to recover economically, socially, politically"" from that violence 50 years later. His administration is battling the police union in court over a Civilian Complaint Review Board, something that advocates first called for in the 1960s but was created by Baraka through executive order in 2015. Hamm pointed out that more than a thousand people were killed by police in the United States last year — more than killed by police in the United Kingdom over the course of the entire 20th Century. ""We don't hate all police. Every civil society has to have police. What we are saying is do your job but your job is not to be the judge and not to be the executioner,"" Hamm said. ""The good police need to stand up and speak up against the racist police that are killing our people."" Some law enforcement officials in New Jersey, meanwhile, have expressed outrage at the death of Floyd. The County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey on Saturday morning called the images of the death ""deeply disturbing"" and called on ""anyone who believes they have been victimized by a member of law enforcement as a result of bias or other improper behavior"" to contact their local police chief or county prosecutor. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday that the state ""will never tolerate the types of police practices that resulted in Mr. Floyd’s death."" Grewal touted the Excellence in Policing Initiative, rolled out in December to increase accountability and transparency in investigations of police misconduct. ""Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go not only in healing our nation’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that prevent all Americans from equally securing our country’s great promises,"" Grewal said. ""Now more than ever, we must redouble our commitment to building trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, especially those from historically marginalized communities.""

The People’s Organization for Progress (POP) will meet at 12:45 p.m. at the Lincoln Statue in downtown Newark, just over three and a half miles down South Orange Ave from Seton Hall’s main campus. The protest will begin at West Market Street and Springfield Avenue, a few blocks west of Seton Hall Law’s campus in downtown Newark. Thousands gathered on foot and in cars in south Minneapolis to protest against police violence and call for justice for George Floyd on May 26. (Fibonacci Blue/Flickr) POP’s chairman, Lawrence Hamm told NJ Advance Media Friday that the organization met via teleconference Thursday and voted unanimously in favor of the protest. “The circumstances of Mr. Floyd’s death were horrific,” Hamm said. “We’re encouraging every person who is outraged about this murder to join us.” Floyd, a 46-year-old black father, was arrested in Minneapolis, Minn. on Monday. Video circulated on the internet showed a police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, even as Floyd became unresponsive. Floyd, who was unarmed and did not appear to resist arrest, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Chauvin and the other officers at the scene were fired, and on Friday Chauvin was charged with third degree murder and mansluaghter by the Minnapolis Distrct Attorney’s Office. The incident has sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racism, some of which have become violent and led to rioting. Minneapolis and other cities have imposed curfews following days of unrest. In a Facebook post, POP requested that all protesters wear masks and practice social distancing. POP describes itself on its website as “an independent, grassroots, community based, politically progressive association of citizens working for racial, social and economic justice and greater unity in the community.” Daniel O’Connor can be reached at daniel.oconnor1@student.shu.edu.

1621189555,2020-05-30 18:00:14,US cities fear protests may fuel new wave of virus outbreaks,https://whyy.org/articles/us-cities-fear-protests-may-fuel-new-wave-of-virus-outbreaks/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have sent shudders through the health community and elevated fears that the huge crowds will lead to a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. Minnesota’s governor said Saturday that too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.” The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced Saturday in Paris when unions flaunted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions against undocumented workers and migrants. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 367,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic.",0.0

Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state’s National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state’s full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — “an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,” according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. “We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,” the governor said Saturday. “But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life.” The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd’s death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd’s death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order “to help keep peace in Louisville.” “I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it’s not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,” Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. “But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe.” President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd’s memory is for authorities to “get tougher” on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called “radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can’t do this.” “They’ve got to be tough, they’ve got to be smart,” Trump said of state officials. “We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military.” In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump’s comments, saying that though the outrage is “real and legitimate,” the protests are “being hijacked by violent radical elements.” “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,” Barr said. “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.” NPR’s Tom Bowman contributed to this report.",0.0

A day that began with mostly peaceful marches through Harlem and neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens descended into chaos as night fell. Demonstrators smashed windows, hurled objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads with garbage and wreckage. A handful of stores in Manhattan had their windows broken and merchandise stolen. Officers sprayed crowds with chemicals, and video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street, knocking several to the ground, after people attacked it with thrown objects, including something on fire. It was unclear whether anyone was hurt. It was the third straight day of protests in the city over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, a remarkable outburst after most New Yorkers spent the past two months stuck inside as the coronavirus devastated the city. A night earlier, several thousand people faced off with a force of officers on the streets around a Brooklyn sports arena. New York City police said 345 people were arrested, 33 officers were injured and 27 police vehicles were damaged.Story continues below gallery New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, blamed the destruction on a small number of agitators who he said “do not represent this city” and were purposely trying to incite violence against police. “We appreciate and respect all peaceful protest, but now it is time for people to go home,” de Blasio told reporters outside the city's emergency management headquarters just after 11:30 p.m. “What we’re seeing is people coming in from outside, a lot of them are purporting to speak about the issues of communities of color, but a lot of them are not from communities of color,” de Blasio said on the local cable news station NY1. I'M DONE DYING: Peekskill rally on George Floyd's death calls for action YONKERS: PD use of force being investigated, commissioner says PROTESTS: Cuomo directs AG's Office to review actions during Brooklyn protests Elsewhere in the state, the mayor in Rochester declared a state of emergency and a 9 p.m. curfew after demonstrators destroyed police cars, setting one on fire, and officers responded with tear gas canisters. Albany police used tear gas and rode horses in efforts to quell demonstrators throwing objects. In Buffalo, numerous storefronts had their windows smashed and a person tried to start a fire in City Hall. The protests in each city were all held in defiance of a statewide ban on gatherings imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is bigger than the pandemic,” said Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski, referring to the outbreak that, until recently, was killing hundreds of New Yorkers each day. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people. Cops seem as though they’ve been trained to do so.” Earlier in the day, de Blasio had expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset about police brutality, but promised an independent review of demonstrations Friday night in which a mob set fire to a police van and battered police cruisers with clubs and officers beat people with batons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had asked the state's attorney general, Letitia James, to lead an inquiry and make a public report. The mayor said he was upset by videos of confrontations “where protesters were handled very violently” by police, including one that showed a woman being needlessly thrown to the ground. But he defended officers in the streets, saying they were being subjected “to horrible, vile things.” Of the video of officers driving into a crowd Saturday, de Blasio said it would be investigated, but that the officers acted because they were being attacked. Violence early Saturday resulted in federal charges against three people suspected of building and throwing Molotov cocktails at police vehicles in two separate incidents in Brooklyn. The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn said Samantha Shader, 27, of Catskill, New York, admitted under questioning to throwing her device at a van occupied by four officers. It did not ignite and the officers were unharmed, police said. Shader’s sister, Dorian, was also arrested and will face charges in state court, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office said. Colinford Mattis, 32, and Urooj Rahman, 31, both of Brooklyn, are accused of targeting a police van. They were charged under a federal statute regarding the use of fire and explosives to cause damage to a police vehicle and each face 5 to 20 years in prison if convicted. Information on their lawyers was not immediately available. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said more than 200 people were arrested and multiple officers were injured in Friday night's protests, including one who lost a tooth. Asked to comment on videos that showed officers shoving peaceful protesters to the ground and hitting people with batons, Shea said those acts would be investigated. But, he said, “It is very hard to practice de-escalation when there is a brick being thrown at your head.” “It is by the grace of God that we don’t have dead officers today,” he said. In a peaceful gathering Saturday afternoon, the Rev. Al Sharpton addressed several hundred people in Staten Island at the spot where Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer in 2014. He was accompanied by Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr. Sharpton noted that Floyd, who died Monday in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck, had also fallen unconscious gasping for air. “Right at this spot is where we heard Eric Garner say what six years later was said by George: ‘I can’t breathe.’” Cuomo noted that Floyd's death was just the latest in a long list of similar deaths, and he said he shared in the outrage over “this fundamental injustice.” “But violence is not the answer. It never is the answer,"" he said. “The violence obscures the righteousness of the message and the mission.” Read or Share this story: https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/new-york/2020/05/30/new-york-city-protests-resume-de-blasio-pleads-calm/5295567002/",0.0

Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Who is causing the violence? Extremists are hijacking peaceful protests, officials say Read this: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it. Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now. I just had to come down and see it,"" said Brian Ledin, 58, who lives in a nearby suburb but was born in the area. Smoke rose from an O’Reilly Auto Parts store and CenterPoint energy workers searched for broken gas lines. Report: Military police could be dispatched to Minnesota The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, the Associated Press reports, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. According to the AP report, soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called. Soldiers in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, booked Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection to Floyd's death. He was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. A criminal complaint that references body cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Read more.",0.0

Chants of Floyd’s name as well as “black lives matter,” “no justice, no peace” and the names of others who have died in encounters with the police echoed off of the buildings surrounding Market Street in the city’s downtown, just a few miles away from Seton Hall’s South Orange campus and blocks away from the University’s law school. Several buildings had their retail spaces shuttered in anticipation of potential violence and looting, which has plagued several major U.S. cities over the last several days in the wake of Floyd’s death. Protesters flooded the streets of Newark on Saturday. (Nicholas Kerr/Editor-in-Chief) The protest, which lasted roughly four hours, remained relatively peaceful in contrast to other major U.S. cities. Protesters in Philadelphia, which experienced its first Floyd-related protest today, clashed with police, burned store fronts, shattered the windows of City Hall and lit several police cars on fire in the city’s downtown area on Saturday afternoon according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. As of press time, at least four arrests had been reported in the city. Several other cities, including New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami and Los Angeles, also experienced similar violence Saturday. In Newark protesters were joined by Mayor Ras Baraka, who spoke to protesters and organizers from the People’s Organization for Progress (POP) beforehand and led marchers through the city’s downtown.

It’s very easy for people to move around and occupy space,” Ahmed said. “This whole area is free of traffic.” Just to provide another sense of scale: pic.twitter.com/kd3PGdG8QM — Nicholas Kerr (busy) (@nickdotkerr) May 30, 2020 “It’s open and people can congregate.

I think that’s a big part of it,” Ahemed said, noting that police blocking off roads could have helped contribute to the tame environment. “Also, the cops aren’t in it. They’re actually interweaved throughout. I’ve seen a bunch, they’re plain clothes,” he added. “They are out, but they’re just sort of observing, but not like yelling at anyone or anything.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall.

""I want him to know that, and I want him to grow up in a better world."" She said her son's safety was her first priority, but the organizers, including Black Lives Matter, seemed to be intent on peaceful protests, which made her feel better about bringing her son on Saturday.

Elected officials and religious leaders also took part in the peaceful demonstration, which began as a grass-roots protest to the police-involved death of a Minneapolis man on Memorial Day. Meanwhile, more South Jersey law enforcement agencies released statements critical of the Minneapolis police action, which has sparked sometimes violent protests across the country. More: Tensions rise at Philadelphia region protests in response to George Floyd's death More: South Jersey law enforcement officials decry police brutality Residents who gathered outside the downtown Police Administration Building said they wanted to show support for Minneapolis residents and others outraged by the death of George Floyd. A video showed Floyd died when a Minneapolis police officer kept a knee on his neck for several minutes during an arrest. Three other officers at the scene failed to come to the dying man's aid.

(Photo: Jim Walsh, Courier-Post) ""We stand in solidarity with the people of Minneapolis,"" said Maniyah Figueroa, a Camden woman who took part in the 1½-mile march. ""It was heartbreaking to see the video,"" said Figueroa. “But I’m not going to say I was surprised. It’s been going on for a long time,” she said. ""The people of Minneapolis do not stand alone,"" added Daniela Martinez, who attended the demonstration with her 7-year-old niece Angelee Rodriguez. Both carried hand-written signs on brightly colored posters. “Black lives matter,” said a bright pink sign held by Angelee, while her aunt's neon green poster read “#georgefloyd.” The protest's organizer, hair salon operator Yolanda ""Yonnie"" Deaver, initially expected participants would come from her social-media followers. But then a friend on the police force asked if she could walk, too, Deaver recounted Sunday. ""I said, 'Of course!'"" said Deaver, who heard next from a lieutenant and then from Chief Joseph Wysocki. “I told them my message was solidarity, justice for George Floyd and black lives matter,” said Deaver. ""He (Wysocki) told me he felt the same way I did,” said Deaver.

""He was chanting 'Black Lives Matter,'"" she noted. ""It turned out really nice. I felt so moved and inspired,"" Deaver said of the march, which began outside her business, Prissy Chic Hair Company on Mount Ephraim Avenue near Thurman Street. Wysocki and members of the city's clergy had decried Floyd's death at a press conference on Thursday, where speakers praised the local department's emphasis on de-escalation techniques and community relations. In a statement Sunday, Wysocki said the department's participation in the march ""was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden."" As part of that approach, the police department offered beverages and masks to marchers. It also stationed a Mr. Softee truck outside the downtown police station to distribute free ice cream treats to demonstrators. Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr. said the officers' role in the ""unity walk"" reflected a focus on ""direct interaction, relationship building and community policing."" Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change. pic.twitter.com/L1GpBkzmU0 — Donald Norcross (@DonaldNorcross) May 30, 2020 That emphasis was implemented after the county department's creation in mid-2013 amidst controversy and allegations of union-busting. It replaced a smaller municipal police force that had been depleted by layoffs. The march also grew to include Mayor Francisco ""Frank"" Moran and Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, as well as other local leaders. ""Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change,"" Norcross tweeted after the event. Deaver said she organized her first-ever protest march after deciding a trip to demonstrate in Minneapolis would be too dangerous. ""My father told me to always follow my heart,” she said. “If we stand together and stop being so divided, we can accomplish anything,” Deaver continued. “Love will always conquer.” Separately, Acting Camden County Prosecutor Jill Mayer said Floyd's death ""undermines'' the relationship between law enforcement and the community. ""It also highlights that there is much more work to be done and it cannot be accomplished by staying silent,"" she said. Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins said he was ""disheartened and disgusted"" by Floyd's death. He said the township's officers were directed to watch the video ""and reflect on what was done wrong."" ""I asked all of the officers, dispatchers, and civilian staff to reflect on 'why we do what we do' as servants to our community. We will honor the memory of Mr. Floyd by striving to do even better,"" Harkins said. Similar statements were released Thursday and Friday by chiefs for the Cherry Hill, Winslow and Camden County police departments. Also Saturday, prosecutor's offices across South Jersey joined in releasing a statement that described Floyd's death as ""deeply disturbing."" ""Our community has the right to trust that they will be treated fairly and justly by the officers who serve them,"" said the statement from the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey. It urged anyone ""who believes they have been victimized by a member of law enforcement as a result of bias or other improper behavior"" to contact the officer's chief or the local county prosecutor's office.

1621293750,2020-05-30 18:16:36,"Opinion: Joe Burrow shows rest of NFL that white athletes must protest inequality, too",http://rssfeeds.northjersey.com/~/625620398/0/northjerseysports~Opinion-Joe-Burrow-shows-rest-of-NFL-that-white-athletes-must-protest-inequality-too/,en,False,,65,"The Record - Hackensack,NJ ",http://www.northjersey.com/,"Joe Burrow can teach the NFL a thing or two. The rest of America, too. Unlike most prominent white male athletes, who have stayed largely silent about the racism and systemic oppression of people of color in this country, the No. 1 pick in last month’s NFL draft addressed it head on. At his own initiative. “The black community needs our help. They have been unheard for far too long,” Burrow said in a Twitter post Friday. “Open your ears, listen, and speak. This isn’t politics. This is human rights.” The outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died Monday after a white police officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, seems like a sea change. Perhaps it’s the sheer brutality of the video of Floyd’s death, with Derek Chauvin appearing calm and impassive to Floyd’s cries that he can’t breathe until his body goes limp. Or maybe it’s exhaustion from the unending bigotry of President Donald Trump, who has emboldened racists and white nationalists to say the quiet things out loud. Whatever it is, the rage and protests roiling the country feel different. Burrow’s heartfelt post, as well as similar statements by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence and the Eagles' Carson Wentz and Zach Ertz, capture that shift. “It’s very rare to see a white athlete say something to this magnitude,” said Louis Moore, an associate professor of history at Grand Valley State and author of “We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete and the Quest for Equality.” “It’s important because it’s so different,” he added. “But it’s also a call to action. And if they pull through, if they actually do something about it, it can change the tide.” When Colin Kaepernick began taking a knee almost four years ago in protest of police brutality against people of color and the racism at the root of it, he was joined by dozens of other players. But with few exceptions – very few exceptions – those players were also people of color. Sure, there were white players who expressed support for their teammates. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers went so far as to say Kaepernick was being blackballed from the league. But very few white NFL players – and none with the profile and sway to change public opinion – were willing to initiate the conversation or take a visible stand. The message was that this was a problem for black and brown players. It was their communities that were affected. They were the ones who knew the pain and humiliation of being judged by the color of their skin. “That’s just how the movement has always been,” Moore said. Whether that’s out of privilege, ignorance or fear of saying the wrong thing, I don’t know. What I do know is that people of color did not create this structure that is rooted in racism, and they cannot be expected to fix it. Not on their own, at least. White people have to speak up and call for change, too. Particularly those who have a platform. Like, say, an NFL quarterback. Sad as it is to say, the letter from the Players Coalition asking for a federal investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down and killed by two white men while he was jogging, probably would have gone largely unnoticed had it not been for one name on it. Tom Brady. SPORTS, DELIVERED:Get the latest sports news sent right to your inbox. Sign up here. Brady avoids anything that could be considered even slightly controversial like he does strawberries. So for the six-time Super Bowl champion to add his name to the call for justice was significant. If you’re a fan of the New England Patriots or Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or just Brady in general, and you’ve never much thought about inequality, or you disapproved of Kaepernick, maybe you reconsider the way you think now. If you’re a Clemson fan, maybe you pause and think about your own implicit biases after reading Lawrence’s posts. “There has to be a shift in the way of thinking,” Lawrence said Friday on Twitter. “I’m siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience. The injustice is clear.. and so is the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you’re still 'explaining’ it – check your heart and ask why.” And if you’re a black or brown player who has stayed quiet, knowing what happened to Kaepernick, maybe you feel emboldened to speak up, knowing your quarterback has your back. “Being from North Dakota, I’ve spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I’m never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already,” Wentz said Thursday night. “I’ll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. “However, I do know that we are all equal at the foot of the cross and Jesus taught us to value others’ lives like they were our own – regardless of skin tone.” Systemic racism is not a black or brown problem. It's a problem, period, one we all need to work to fix. It's nice to see high-profile, white male athletes finally joining in the fight.

Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said 13 police officers were injured in protests over the death of George Floyd that resulted in property damage and several burned cars. Outlaw reportedly also said civilians suffered injuries as well. A citywide curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. Police began enforcing the curfew and pushing lines of protesters away from Center City at about 9 p.m. Dressed in riot gear, they marched south down 15th street and used batons and shields to force protesters to retreat. Philadelphia police said shortly after 2 a.m. that 109 arrests were made, including 52 for curfew violations and 43 for looting or burglary. ""Only persons with essential duties will be permitted outdoors,"" Philadelphia police said in a tweet Saturday night. They’re moving the line south and threatening arrests #phillyprotestpic.twitter.com/hQGAi14Kix — Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) May 31, 2020 Hours before the curfew took effect, hundreds flooded city hall, damaging cars and spray painting messages on buildings, vehicles and the city block. “I watched three cars burn right here,” one message read. At least four cars were burned, and the statue of former controversial police commissioner and mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced. Protesters also broke windows at City Hall and damaged dozens of business near Chestnut Street, including a Foot Locker and Walgreens. A Starbucks outside City Hall was also set on fire. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday night signed a disaster emergency declaration to provide all necessary assistance to municipalities as they respond to the escalation of protests in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Gov. Wolf said. CLOSE Protests began peacefully but took a turn at night as crowds dispersed into Center City Philadelphia. This video contains explicit language. Delaware News Journal The declaration authorizes the Pennsylvania National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner to activate personnel and use resources ""as necessary to alleviate the danger to public health and safety caused by this emergency."" Philadelphia police said late Saturday night that an officer was “attempting to stop individuals in a vehicle who were involved in looting a business in the area of 7th and Chestnut” and was run over by the vehicle. The officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital and sustained a broken arm and other injuries. A burned police car sat out front of an Apple store on Walnut street between 16th and 17th, where many businesses were damaged. The Philadelphia Fire Department later responded to a three-alarm fire at 1700 Walnut, just northeast of Rittenhouse Park.

(Photo: Jenna Miller/Delaware News Journal) At 10:30 p.m., armored police vehicles used what appeared to be tear gas to disperse light crowds on Broad Street and more arrests were made. 'This is necessary' Two Philadelphia protests morphed into one early Saturday afternoon as thousands of marchers moved from a City Hall demonstration to a larger, Black Lives Matter-sanctioned gathering at the Philadelphia Art Museum. People, an overwhelming majority in masks, were met with a strong police presence as they gathered just after noon, with many more people still arriving as the day went on. Earlier in the day, there were chants of ""We will remain,'' with responses of ""Peaceful!'' from the gatherers. These were followed by chants of, ""No justice!'' ""No peace!'' Kevin Sellers of West Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek neighborhood, described racial climate in this country as being ""at a boiling point and the pot has boiled over.'' ""We are tired of the rhetoric and thoughts and prayers,"" said Sellers, who is black. ""Too many people, black men and women, have been killed at the hands of police and Eric Garner and George Floyd was caught on tape and still they take days and days and days to investigate and our patience has boiled over.''

She was taking pictures with her phone at 8:40 p.m., as she stood near the corner of Chestnut and 15 streets, where a trash can was on fire, the windows of a Wells Fargo busted and debris lay strewn west down the block. “This is what they have to do to be heard. I stand with them.” Ebony Franklin of Nicetown, who is black, and two friends were on hand passing out free water to rally attendees at the museum. ""It is really hot and we wanted to be supportive,'' she said. ""Everyone is tired and frustrated. This is something small that we can do. People have been coming to us and refilling our coolers all day.'' Nehemiah Whittley of Philadelphia is a performance artist who was lying flat on his back on the marble in front of the art museum. He said he wants people to remember that change can come through art. ""I want people to see a reflection in me and in the marble of change,'' he added. Beth Wright of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, brought her son, Daniel, who is 8. The white mother said she wanted to bring her son ""to teach him what to do when he sees something wrong, and this was wrong."" ""It's unjust,"" she said, fighting tears behind her mask. ""I want him to know that, and I want him to grow up in a better world."" She said her son's safety was her first priority, but the organizers, including Black Lives Matter, seemed to be intent on peaceful protests, which made her feel better about bringing her son on Saturday. Police, too, she said, ""seem friendly and not adversarial,"" adding to her sense of security.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said.

Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse.

Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that."" He added: ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here, who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles."" He said the situation was started by a group of protesters converging on the police car and attacking it. Other video showed at least one vehicle on fire. An initially peaceful demonstration in the city had spiraled into chaos Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. Video posted to social media on Friday showed officers using batons and shoving protesters as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her.

Police said they were searching for a Chevrolet compact car with Wyoming plates. The city had enacted a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. A few agitators, the department said, were ""hijacking"" Floyd's memory. Police shared photos of a gun, a gas canister and a hatchet — all of which were confiscated Saturday.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds.

Police responded by pushing the crowd away, firing tear gas and bean bag rounds as they marched forward. At one point, some in the crowd tried to build a makeshift barrier with trash cans, but police pushed through and arrested several people. Others fled down streets and alleys. — Dan Horn, Madeline Mitchell, Cameron Knight and Sharon Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer Des Moines, Iowa: Protesters throw fireworks at police Police in riot gear met protesters marching on the state’s Capitol building. Some protesters could be seen throwing fireworks at police. At the Polk County Courthouse, protesters scattered after police fired tear gas into the crowd.

""The situation in Minnesota is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cites,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said.

Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C.

Montgomery, Alabama: Largely peaceful protests at precinct, Capitol Dozens gathered Saturday afternoon in front of a Montgomery police precinct before a gathering at the Capitol, where law enforcement blocked off traffic for a rally that lasted more than two hours. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed on Friday called Floyd's death a ""lynching"" in a virtual town hall before asking for a moment of silence for him at an afternoon press conference. Police Chief Ernest Finley also spoke, calling Floyd's death ""very disturbing."" — Melissa Brown, Montgomery Advertiser Providence, Rhode Island: A chorus of 1,000 voices A chorus of nearly 1,000 voices shouted Floyd’s name from the Statehouse lawn on Saturday. “I’m tired of watching young black, brown, beautiful people dying,” said Gary Dantzler, an activist with Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, the group that organized Saturday’s rally. “White supremacy, we gotta end it.” - Madeleine List, Providence Journal Lake Worth Beach, Florida: No violence Shouting “I can’t breathe"" and “Hands up, don’t shoot,” about 250 demonstrators stopped traffic downtown on Saturday.

A crowd of a few hundred marched for about a mile and a half in Peoria on Saturday afternoon, from the riverfront to the city's police station and the courthouse, alternating call-and-response slogans, including ""No justice, no peace; no racist police"" and ""Fired up! Ready to go!"" Most attendees wore masks or other face coverings, which organizers urged to abide by the state's standing public health orders. The peaceful demonstration of just more than two hours included participants chanting not only Floyd's name, but also the names of Peoria men Eddie Russell Jr. and Luis Cruz, who were killed in police-involved shootings over the past three years.

George Floyd."" Groups of people prepared to march out in three rows through the streets of downtown to the police headquarters several blocks away. “I’m here to make them see we are here with Minneapolis — we are here in solidarity as a community,” said Andrew Miragliotta, who went to the rally with his wife, Jenna Miragliotta.

We are bringing our bodies, our voices to support and show up. Visibility matters.” - Maria Clark, The American South Visalia, California: 'This is America' Hundreds of protesters – from toddlers to adults – lined a highway, chanting “Black lives matter” and holding signs that said “justice for George Floyd” and “we will be the change.” One protester brought a portable speaker and played Childish Gambino’s “This is America.” Cars honked as they drove past. - Vongni Yang, The Visalia Times Delta Rochester, New York: 'For over 400 years, we have been in pain' Hundreds marched to the Public Safety Building in downtown Rochester on Saturday to honor victims of police brutality. Organizers asked participants to wear masks and practice social distancing. “Four hundred years ago, a lie got told — the lie of white superiority and black inferiority,” said Melanie Funchess, the director of community engagement for the Mental Health Association of Rochester/Monroe County. “For over 400 years, we have been in pain.” Some members of the crowd spray painted poles and other objects along the way; their actions were later denounced by organizers of the event. Rochester police were present at the rally, but did not intervene. Some were armed and carried shields. - Sarah Taddeo, USA TODAY Network Greenville, South Carolina: Organizers encourage unity More than 200 people gathered in Greenville on Saturday morning for a peaceful protest. Dalores Bowens, one of the organizers, said the goal of the protest was to highlight the risks that black people, and others, face at times from police. But the big aim, she said, was to encourage unity and have a peaceful expression of anger and frustration. – Mike Ellis, Eric Connor and Sarah Sheridan, Greenville News",0.0

You don’t control just one protagonist; instead, you control the movement. When your avatar is killed, you simply control another worker in the group. “As long as one of us survives, the Revolution will live on,” another text pop-up proclaims. As an “unapologetically anti-capitalist” release, Tonight We Riot arrives in a time of need. During the pandemic, labor crises and inhumane treatment of workers have rocketed into the spotlight. While Jeff Bezos barrels towards trillionaire status, Amazon workers are reporting worsened conditions and lower pay. Pre-pandemic conditions that were suspect at best are now being recognized as exploitative and evil. Rarely has there been a better time to jump into a fiction where you and your coworkers fight against the tyranny of a money-hungry regime and build a more equitable world for all. Tonight We Riot is an explicitly socialist offering in an industry that often flirts with but rarely commits to these principles. Influential titles like Bioshock, Borderlands, and The Outer Worlds have, in their own ways, prodded at the cruelties of capitalism. Video game critic Carli Velocci dubbed capitalism the most significant in-game antagonist of 2019. But PPU512 founder and art steward Ted Anderson and programmer Stephen Meyer, the co-creators of Tonight We Riot, wanted to push the needle further. SEE ALSO: The ‘Space Force’ Visuals Taken From SpaceX, 007, Brutalism and More “What if we just made an honest-to-goodness leftist game that is unapologetically so, where we show that [leftist] structure, we show that there could be this fight, that it could have an actual culmination, that we could go somewhere with it?” Anderson tells Observer about the idea behind Tonight We Riot. “On one level, it’s a cute little pixel art game,” says Meyer. “But on another, there’s a mechanic here that’s different from normal game mechanics where there’s one protagonist embracing this ‘great man’ theory of history. No, no, no. It’s the movement. It’s the people rising up.” Like television, film and books, video games are a space where worldviews are shaped, and culture is produced and reproduced. Meyer references the popularity of military shooter games as a cultural force. “They’re sort of this neo-conservative fantasy,” he says. “Up until grad school, I still had that view of ‘military might makes right.’” But while TV and movies are subject to rigorous analysis in mainstream media sources, video games aren’t subject to the same level of scrutiny outside of the gaming community. “There’s a lot of games that people assume aren’t political just because they see games as being set aside from other media [or] divorced from the reality that we all share,” says Anderson. “It’s still made by people, and people have lives and biases, and make decisions unconsciously where those biases align.” Tonight We Riot is published by Means Interactive, the newly minted video games arm of worker-owned leftist media company Means TV. Naomi Burton, who cofounded Means along with Nick Hayes in Detroit, explains that they’re in talks with a number of similarly aligned developers. Means’ deals are structured such that the majority of sales profits go to developers, while Means takes a small percentage. The coop’s profits are then allocated to the next project. “There hasn’t been a game explicitly about toppling capitalism before,” says Burton. “Seeing those anti-capitalist values that over 50% of young Americans have reflected in a video game makes all of us feel seen and heard, and reminded we’re not alone in the fight for a better future.” Gaming communities are committed to this vision, too. Socialist Gamers is a community for left-wing gamers to build solidarity and counter far-right gamer culture. “They wanted to carve out a place for leftist video game fans to meet and connect without the toxicity that’s all too prevalent in online gaming culture,” says Leslie, a Boston-based gamer who connected with Socialist Gamers in 2017, and who asked to be identified by her first name. “The industry itself still has a long way to go in terms of being more accessible and less misogynistic, but the themes and messaging that games are sharing with players are getting more and more revolutionary, and I think that’s absolutely a good thing.” Socialist Gamer staff member Brian, who lives in West Virginia and also asked to be identified by his first name, seeks out releases that align with his left-wing values, but says that while many studios and developers are liberal, most aren’t anti-capitalist. “There’s a large untapped market for leftist ideals to be in video game narratives, but developers are not in any way incentivized to make explicitly leftist games,” he says. California-based gamer Quinny Cascade is heartened by the visibly radical bent of Tonight We Riot and similar works. “[It] was made for me,” she tells Observer over Twitter DM. “Or rather, it was made for Us. Much of any media’s intellectual, emotional, and social priming is representative of the status quo. Deviating from that formula can genuinely upset people. “I’m a Native American, Pakistani trans woman with ADHD, and I’m aggressively and empathetically leftist as hell. I’m also angry, loud, and dark skinned. Most things are not created with me in mind… [Tonight We Riot is] no more political than any other game is, it just reflects the voices of the unheard.” Cascade adds, “I think the truth is that most people are anti-capitalist, they just don’t know it yet.” The lethal and imbalanced conditions forced by COVID-19 are disproportionately impacting communities that were already marginalized and targeted, a pattern that holds true in the gaming community. “Most folks who play video games now are people of color, and almost half are women,” says Leslie. “Essentially, those who have been most affected by COVID-19. The workers who help make our favorite games get laid off while executives are basically unaffected.” But Leslie also highlights community-building creativity in Animal Crossing and fundraising efforts led by streamers as examples of organizing in the community to counter—or at least mitigate the misery brought on by—the pandemic’s oppressive conditions. Game Workers Unite is an international organization building towards unionizing the game industry, while other worker coops like The Glory Society, founded by Night in the Woods co-creators Bethany Hockenberry and Scott Benson, and Motion Twin continue to create video games that are the product of equitable working conditions. This mutual support and collectivism, says Anderson, are the only threats posed by Tonight We Riot’s socialism. “A socialist is only threatening those rich people with living at the same level that everyone else already has to live, but improving those conditions to the point that that’s not terrible anymore,” he says. “These aren’t unreasonable demands, these are demands for life.”",0.0

The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Monday sparked a firestorm of protests and riots throughout the country, with scenes of violence unfolding on social media and TV screens. In North Jersey though, the events were peaceful. A rally held under the scorching afternoon sun in Englewood drew a crowd of more than 1,000. The organizer of Englewood's protest, Ainsworth Minott, was adamant about the march remaining peaceful. Before its start, he instructed anyone with bad intentions to leave. Story continues below the gallery The tone was of unity. Bob Marley’s “One Love” played in the background. The protest began at Mackay Park and was followed by a march to the Englewood police station. It included a reading of 84 names of black people who had been killed in encounters with police. The names included Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Teaneck’s Phillip Pannell, a 16-year-old who was fatally shot 30 years ago, sparking riots in that town.

(Photo: Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey - USA TODAY NETWORK) Marchers wore masks and maintained social distance as they chanted, “Justice for George Floyd, no justice, no peace” and “I can’t breathe.” Englewood resident Karen Bronstein carried a sign that read “Racism is a white problem.” ""People who are black can only say so much. The problem is coming from the people that are white,"" said Bronstein. ""I had to be out here to show my support and heartbreak, rage, over what is still continuing in our country."" Protesters in Englewood were from diverse backgrounds, and there was a large number of young adults in their 20s. When Minott stood back to admire the crowd he said, ""this is a beautiful thing."" “Why is my blackness so weaponized in this country, and I’m here to combat that,” said John Robinson IV of Englewood. For Robinson, it was the first time seeing so many people who are not black getting behind the cause of equality for black people in America. “Racism is not a black problem, it takes everybody,” he said. Samuel Griffin, head coach of the Teaneck’s High School football team, came out with his young son. “I think it is important for him to know that he has no reason to be afraid of the police or cops if he is not breaking any laws, and that his rights matter,” Griffin said. Newark remained peaceful as well Saturday afternoon, with a crowd of at least 5,000 people who gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln at the foot of Newark's historic courthouse.

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (purple shirt) spoke during the protest. (Photo: Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey - USA TODAY NETWORK) Many protesters wore black as a sign of mourning, and many attended with children. ""My children need to witness that their mother raised her voice in protest,"" said West Orange teacher Ashley Barnes. ""We need to tell our black men how we love them and care about them."" Protesters marched east on Market Street from the courthouse. There were occasional chants as they went. Police, who wore their standard uniform with masks to protect against COVID-19, silently orchestrated traffic around the moving crowd, blocking streets behind protesters and rerouting vehicles one street at a time as they moved. The rally was organized by The People's Organization for Progress, a citizen association working for racial, social and economic justice and community unity. Its members, in yellow shirts, circulated through the crowd, encouraging an orderly march, handing out markers and poster board to those who wanted to make signs, and distributing water to the thirsty standing in the 83-degree sun. On the courthouse steps, Hannah Smith and Jesse Grupper of Montclair held signs seeking ""justice for George Floyd."" ""There was a complete lack of respect for humanity,"" Smith said, referring to Floyd's killing. ""No one deserves that."" Rallies were also scheduled in Trenton, North Bergen, Burlington County, Morristown, Point Pleasant Beach and Asbury Park. In Englewood, Councilman Wayne Hamer, who is black and has two small sons, said, ""This is about supporting the whole initiative and supporting my family and bringing awareness to people who don't look like me and who don't think like me."" A police cruiser led off the march in the city, which concluded at the Englewood police station, where Phillip Pannell's sister, Natacha Pannell, wore a T-shirt honoring her brother. Pannell was 13 when her brother died. She has a 21-year-old son in college and said that’s why she was out at the march,still fighting for the same things. “My question is what do they want us to do? My question to authorities is what do they want us to do if our backs are up against the wall,” Pannell said. Marching is not enough, Pannell said, because “they are killing our kids."" More than 100 people gathered outside Paterson City Hall in the early afternoon for what organizers said would be a peace vigil in memory of George Floyd. But the gathering quickly turned into a protest over the January 2019 death of Jameek Lowery, the 27-year-old Paterson man who died in police custody after recording a frantic video at the city’s police headquarters, in which he said that cops wanted to kill him. Authorities last year said autopsy results revealed Lowery died from the interaction between drugs he took and a pre-existing medical condition. His sister, Jamilyha Lowery, told the protesters that George Floyd and her brother were the same because, “They both begged for their life and no one listened.” Paterson pastors, the Rev. Allan Boyer of Bethel A.M.E. Church and the Rev. Michael D. McDuffie of the Mighty Sons of God Fellowship Church, managed to quell the vociferous crowd by offering brief prayers for the family of Floyd and all those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.

""If my kids are not here to survive how are they going to be a teacher when they grow up, how are they going to get to do the stuff that they should do."" “Dr. King said that rioting is the voice of the unheard but you have to hear what else he said in that speech,” McDuffie stated. “Some people have an unorthodox way of communicating their pain. But we have to listen to them, interpret and redirect their voice, and work together."" Ed Rumley of the Paterson Press contributed to this story.

Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer with over a dozen complaints for brutality during the course of his career, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — even though Floyd was lying face down on the ground and hand-cuffed from behind. Officer Thomas K. Lane held Floyd’s legs down and Officer J. Alexander Keung held his back. The other arresting officer, Tou Thao, stood by and watched. Floyd protested that he could not breathe. Under the circumstances, it is clear that Floyd posed no threat to anyone. Officer Chauvin continued kneeling on Floyd’s neck for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd had become unresponsive. When bystanders pleaded on Floyd’s behalf, they were threatened with being pepper-sprayed. Floyd was tortured to death. This was a lynching of a black man, pure and simple.

(Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) And, for what? He was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill at a deli. While one cannot justify passing counterfeit currency, if that is exactly what Floyd did, since when does that warrant a death sentence? And, since when do the police have the right to be judge, jury and executioner of the accused? The black and brown victims of police brutality are too numerous to name all of them, but here are a few: Sandra Bland Michael Brown Christian Cooper Sean Bell Oscar Grant Eric Garner Freddie Gray Yvonne Smallwood Philando Castille Tamir Rice Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, who was not an actual police officer, but got off anyway. One of the most infamous of these cases was that of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police officers of the New York City street crimes unit in 2000. What was his “crime?” When asked to show his identification he reached into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet. These cases are all disheartening and enraging at the same time. They are the reason for the demand that Black Lives Matter, which means that “Black Lives Also Matter,” not that ""Only Black Lives Matter."" If there is anything positive to take away from this it is that people of all races are speaking up about this. The movement for Black Lives is multi-racial. A woman cries as she joins protesters at Union Square in Manhattan on Saturday, May 30, 2020. Several thousand people rallied and marched through lower Manhattan to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier in the week.

The organization 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement appreciated the song and supported Springsteen. As a white man, I have a duty to recognize that I benefit from white privilege whether I seek it or not in ways that are obvious and in others that are not so obvious. White people have a duty to educate other white people about white privilege and the importance of speaking out and standing with our black and brown sisters and brothers to demand justice for George Floyd and every other person of color who is wrongfully killed by the police.

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in several cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after the 8 p.m. curfew there as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were “committed to do whatever it takes to bring order.” Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to “take care of each other.” We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response,” he wrote. “But burning down communities and needless destruction is not.” Biden added, “the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest.” 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident’s connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. “Downtown is not safe at this time,” Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day’s protests “successful” in a tweet, but condemned the “small group of people” that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard. Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage “upsetting” at a late-night press conference Saturday but said it was “inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers.” He addressed the city’s peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. “We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,” he said. “We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home.” California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall.

At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing Black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldn’t do. Should have been used 2 days ago & there would not have been damage & Police Headquarters would not have been taken over & ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death.

Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night.",0.0

The city ordered all retail stores to close immediately and moved up its mandatory, citywide curfew by two hours to begin at 6 p.m. Community members and business owners helping to clean up vandalized properties were urged to return home by 5 p.m. All Center City streets are closed to vehicle traffic until further notice. The closure area runs from Vine to South streets and from the Delaware River to the Schuylkill River, and includes all bridges and expressway entrances and exits. Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered the Benjamin Franklin Bridge closed to foot and vehicle traffic until further notice. The Walt Whitman bridge remains open. SEPTA will shut down all service starting at 6 p.m. until at least 6 a.m. on Monday. This includes all bus and trolley routes, service on the Broad Street and Market-Frankford subway lines, Regional Rail and the Norristown High Speed Line. All SEPTA bus routes, trolleys, the Market-Frankford, Broad Street, and Norristown High Speed Lines are suspended at 6 p.m. today until further notice due to civil unrest and vandalism. — SEPTA (@SEPTA) May 31, 2020 All city services and Philadelphia government operations — except for public safety — will be closed tomorrow. City-run meal distribution sites normally open on Mondays have been postponed to Tuesday. A City Council budget hearing set for Monday — for which Philadelphia Police are expected to get a $14 million increase under Kenney’s post-COVID-19 budget — has been postponed. The city’s regularly scheduled coronavirus briefing scheduled for Monday has been canceled. City Managing Director Brian Abernathy said that as of 12 p.m., there have been 10 additional arrests for looting. Thirteen code violation notices were given out for failure to disperse. In the area of 52nd and Market streets, five officers were injured and officers were hit with bricks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. Abernathy said tensions in Kensington have started to calm down, but that the area around 52 and Market streets in West Philly is still “very much an active situation.” Center City, Abernathy said, has remained “relatively calm” in comparison to yesterday. However, WHYY education reporter Avi Wolfman-Arent was arrested while covering at a protest near Independence Hall, for allegedly failing to follow a dispersal order, and despite identifying himself as a member of the press. Im a reporter with ⁦@WHYYNews⁩ in Philly. Yes, I was just arrested. A very brief explanation below: pic.twitter.com/5u5h4A7erS — Avi Wolfman-Arent (@Avi_WA) May 31, 2020 Abernathy also said police are responding to other issues of violence, including a quadruple shooting in Kensington, where a 12-year-old boy and three adults were shot. The city managing director closed Sunday evening’s press briefing with a message to TV news media. “As your cameras continue to roll over scenes of looting, over cars that are putting TVs in their trunks, know that our investigators are tracking all those license plates you’re capturing,” Abernathy said. “We’re paying attention to all the faces being captured, so keep doing it because you’re helping our investigations.” State officials said the National Guard has also been requested in Montgomery County, where the King of Prussia Mall and an AT&T store on Route 202 and Allendale Road in Montgomery County were looted Saturday, according to CBS3. Upper Merion on Sunday declared a “township emergency.” A curfew will be in effect from 8 p.m. through 6 a.m. Monday. Upper Merion Township officials detailed Saturday’s events in a Facebook post late Sunday evening. The post says community members held a protest that “demonstrated exactly how a peaceful protest works: non-violent, non-threatening freedom of expression from the public and tolerance from authorities.” But a separate event with no connection to the protest took place hours later at the King of Prussia Mall, where hundreds of people stole items from the mall and destroyed property. Nine people were arrested, officials said, and none of them were Upper Merion residents. In a tweet late Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump called for “law and order” in Philadelphia, and suggested calling in the National Guard. Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Looting spreads outside Center City As roughly 500 people gathered outside City Hall for a peace rally Sunday afternoon, looting and vandalism continued, including outside Center City, alarming many residents. Groups of people could be seen leaving Port Richmond stores with armloads of merchandise, according to NBC10. At 52nd Street in West Philly, multiple police cars burned, and people looted stores in the area. Larneice Poindexter said she was at the corner of 52nd and Walnut streets when she saw someone had lit a trashcan on fire at a nearby McDonald’s. She said officers started shooting rubber bullets and using tear gas to control the crowds. Poindexter said she came to the area for some pizza and lamented how unsafe it feels in her neighborhood. “I was born when Martin Luther King was killed … April 4th, 1968 and I can’t believe I’m living what that man lived,” she said. “His dream back then, to see us be free — I want my 14-year-old autistic son to live. I won’t want him to walk down the street and he can’t understand ‘Stop, put your hands up,’ so he can’t go nowhere without Momma.” “The man got charged with third-degree murder, they fired him, that’s the best you’re going to get,” said Tahira Young, of West Philly, of now-fired Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin who is charged with murdering George Floyd. Young said she thinks the rioting misses the point because it hurts residents and businesses where she lives. “It wasn’t fair for the man to do what he did, but it’s not fair for them to do what they did, because these merchants didn’t do anything for their property to be stolen, broken and rioted in,” she said. “McDonald’s didn’t do anything to get burned down.” City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who represents West Philadelphia, said she witnessed the unrest on 52nd Street firsthand, and said “we cannot allow this to continue.” Gauthier said that as protesters became more aggressive, police also increased their aggression and intimidation. “The 3rd District is a vibrant community, and 52nd Street is at its heart,” Gauthier said in a statement. “It is tragic to see our own small businesses — the lifeblood of this neighborhood — being destroyed. And I’m terrified for these youth, because I don’t want them to get hurt in the process.” She added that as a mother of two Black sons, she understands the outrage and that people have reached a “boiling point.” “I am looking forward to tomorrow, though: to rebuilding, and to generating real, substantive change,” Gauthier said. “We as City leaders must hear what people are angry about and respond — not just placate and go back to business as usual.” For Gloria Cartagena, the combination of the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns and the citywide chaos is “a double whammy” to North Philly residents. In Kensington, where she lives, the poverty rate is 44% — nearly double that of the rest of the city. Combined with a severe opioid crisis in the neighborhood that has exacerbated homelessness and made social distancing difficult, Cartagena said when the rest of Philadelphia gets hit hard, Kensington gets hit harder. “A lot of these people [looting], they’re not even from this area,” said Cartagena, former president and current secretary of Somerset Neighbors for Better Living. “They’re from West Philly, Southwest Philly, even Delaware … but we live here, we sleep here, we eat here, we play here, and we don’t feel safe.” Cartagena has been doing community work for the past 35 years. She says the residents who called her this morning were frustrated, scared, feeling trapped. The looting they described was “out of control.” Recent protests across the nation, as well as in Philly, have often targeted large corporations — the Port Richmond Walmart was looted, for example. But in Kensington, big chains weren’t the only ones that took damage. Jess Shoffner, an urban gardener and Kensington resident on the 500 block of Hart Lane, said she’d heard neighbors talking about a looted corner store only a block away. The fire station down the street, she said, “has been wailing sirens all morning … there were people running up Kensington Avenue, some wearing masks, some not. We don’t really know what’s going on.” ‘A slap in the face’ The mayor, who on Sunday morning toured the damage left behind on Walnut Street, said the images of residents turning out with brooms, shovels and trash bags to “restore their city” gave him hope. “I understand that the larger issues that fueled yesterday’s events remain,” Kenney said, explaining that the more violent destruction was born of decades of systemic racism and poverty, “two factors that work hand in hand to fuel anger and hopelessness.” The destruction, however, was “disappointing beyond words,“ Kenney said. “We’re better than what happened last night,” he said Sunday’s press conference came after an afternoon that saw about 3,000 people attend peaceful protests over police violence gave way to destruction by Saturday evening. Smaller groups of demonstrators set fire to at least nine structures, including multiple vehicles and the City Hall Starbucks. Some also smashed windows, set fire to mannequins and office furniture, vandalized and looted businesses on Chestnut and Walnut streets in Center City. Both Kenney and Outlaw reiterated that Saturday’s organized protests were peaceful and orderly, but that criminal activity would not be tolerated. Outlaw, Philadelphia’s first Black female police chief, also indicated that she too was affected by George Floyd’s death. “I wear many hats,” Outlaw said. “I’ve been a Black woman my entire life. I have Black sons. I enforce the law, but there is a very clear narrative here.” That narrative, Outlaw said, stemmed from “a lot of hurt and anger.” The police commissioner, responding to a question about whether a large percentage of arrests were tied to white people, described the destruction as in “misalignment” with the message carried out by Saturday’s peaceful protesters. “Frankly, those folks didn’t look like me,” Outlaw said, adding that the destruction was a “slap in the face” and a “setback for everything that’s been accomplished for those working to fix the issues within the criminal justice system.” Thirteen police officers were injured Saturday. Injuries included chemical burns to the face and arms, broken extremities and head injuries, per Outlaw. One officer remains hospitalized after reportedly being struck by a vehicle. Officials are still working to confirm the number of civilians injured. Four police vehicles were set ablaze, including one state police vehicle. Nine fires were set to various structures, and 207 arrests were made. Outlaw said she expects the number of arrests to grow. About 40 people are expected to face felony burglary charges stemming from the protests and looting Saturday afternoon and evening. At least one person will likely be charged with aggravated assault against a police officer, and three people face gun charges. These are in addition to 52 citations for curfew violations and nine civil citations. Paul Hetznecker, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney, says these criminal cases differ from mass arrests at previous protests like the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In that instance, Hetznecker says the city used “catch and release” for demonstrators who charged a fence at the Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia. Prior to the 2016 DNC, City Council passed an ordinance decriminalizing such incidents like disturbing the peace, and failure to disperse during protests, essentially charging protestors with a civil offense. Saturday’s protests led to a greater level of property destruction and theft. Hetznecker, who is part of a team of lawyers offering to defend those arrested pro bono, also defended protestors at the 2000 Republican National Convention when more than 400 people were arrested and some charged with felonies. At that event, there were just a few incidents of property damage and more than 90% of those who faced charges were acquitted. He says the current protests are a very different level of social unrest than those that have taken place in the past in the city. Vandalism, looting and burglary, he says, are not protected by the First Amendment. “Certainly the overriding issue of police abuse and institutional racism historically within police departments across this country is the most significant issue,” he said, “not only from the death of George Floyd, but from the death of every African American individual who has been killed at the hands of police.”",0.0

The People’s Organization for Progress, which aims to eradicate racism, will protest beginning at 1 p.m. at the Lincoln statue, located at West Market Street and Springfield Avenue, in Newark. Protesters are asked to arrive wearing virus-protective masks and gloves no later than 12:45 p.m. UPDATE: Floyd brutality protest starts peacefully in Newark, with chants of ‘I can’t breathe’ Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. Floyd, who wasn’t armed, later died. Four police officers who were at the scene have been fired. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder. Among the other protests planned in New Jersey: At noon on Saturday, a group will meet at Frieda’s Garden, 323 North 4th Avenue in Highland Park in Middlesex County. A procession will go to Staten Island to the site where Eric Garner died before heading to Garner’s grave in Union County. In Trenton on Saturday, a coalition of groups is planning a solidarity march beginning at 1 p.m. on State Street in front of the capitol building. Also Saturday in Hudson County, a protest was planned for 3 p.m. in James J. Braddock Park in North Bergen. In Bloomfield, the township council and community faith leaders are holding a vigil on Zoom scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. on Saturday. Black Lives Matter Morristown plans a protest at 7 p.m. on Saturday. The rally will start as a car procession from Morristown High School and will end with a social-distanced vigil outside Morris Township police headquarters. In Englewood, a rally was planned for noon Saturday near the recreation department and will include a march along Lafayette Place, First Street and Englewood Avenue before ending at the police station, according to NorthJersey.com. Another protest in Trenton, “Justice for George Floyd,” is planned from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, according to PlanetPrinceton.com In Burlington County, a vigil is planned for 7 p.m. Sunday on Walnut Street in Bordentown. Also Monday, a group calling itself “Asbury Park Justice for George Floyd” is hosting a 5 p.m. rally at 801 Bangs Ave. SOMA Justice, an equal rights group from South Orange and Maplewood in Essex County, staged a Friday evening “Die-In” at the intersection of South Orange Avenue and SOPAC Way in South Orange to honor victims of racist violence. Video from the rally showed protesters lying in the street chanting, “The people, united, will never be defeated.” Protests over Floyd’s death have spread across the United States into early Saturday, spilling into New York City, Atlanta, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Portland and Washington, D.C. Many of the rallies have turned violent, with people setting police vehicles on fire, smashing windows and burning buildings to the ground. In Minneapolis, thousands of protesters ignored a curfew and vows of a forceful police response to take to the city’s streets for a fourth straight night, and some public officials acknowledged they didn’t have enough manpower to control the large crowds. Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday tweeted “George Floyd should be alive today – not just as a matter of principle or justice, but as a matter of human dignity.” “Too many times we’ve gotten a national wake-up call and done nothing,” the governor said. “Justice for George means acknowledging our nation’s centuries-old stain of racism.” Our journalism needs your support.

A day that began with mostly peaceful marches through Harlem and neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens descended into chaos as night fell. Demonstrators smashed windows, hurled objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads with garbage and wreckage. A handful of stores in Manhattan had their windows broken and merchandise stolen.

It was unclear whether anyone was hurt. It was the third straight day of protests in the city over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, a remarkable outburst after most New Yorkers spent the past two months stuck inside as the coronavirus devastated the city.

Albany police used tear gas and rode horses in efforts to quell demonstrators throwing objects. In Buffalo, numerous storefronts had their windows smashed and a person tried to start a fire in City Hall. The protests in each city were all held in defiance of a statewide ban on gatherings imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is bigger than the pandemic,” said Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski, referring to the outbreak that, until recently, was killing hundreds of New Yorkers each day. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people. Cops seem as though they’ve been trained to do so.” Earlier in the day, de Blasio had expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset about police brutality, but promised an independent review of demonstrations Friday night in which a mob set fire to a police van and battered police cruisers with clubs and officers beat people with batons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had asked the state's attorney general, Letitia James, to lead an inquiry and make a public report. The mayor said he was upset by videos of confrontations “where protesters were handled very violently” by police, including one that showed a woman being needlessly thrown to the ground. But he defended officers in the streets, saying they were being subjected “to horrible, vile things.” Of the video of officers driving into a crowd Saturday, de Blasio said it would be investigated, but that the officers acted because they were being attacked. Violence early Saturday resulted in federal charges against three people suspected of building and throwing Molotov cocktails at police vehicles in two separate incidents in Brooklyn. The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn said Samantha Shader, 27, of Catskill, New York, admitted under questioning to throwing her device at a van occupied by four officers. It did not ignite and the officers were unharmed, police said. Shader’s sister, Dorian, was also arrested and will face charges in state court, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office said. Colinford Mattis, 32, and Urooj Rahman, 31, both of Brooklyn, are accused of targeting a police van. They were charged under a federal statute regarding the use of fire and explosives to cause damage to a police vehicle and each face 5 to 20 years in prison if convicted. Information on their lawyers was not immediately available. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said more than 200 people were arrested and multiple officers were injured in Friday night's protests, including one who lost a tooth. Asked to comment on videos that showed officers shoving peaceful protesters to the ground and hitting people with batons, Shea said those acts would be investigated.

He was accompanied by Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr.

It's unclear if there were injuries. Storyful Two New York Police Department vehicles plowed into demonstrators rallying against police brutality Saturday as the crowd pushed a barricade against one of them and pelted it with objects. The incident occurred near Prospect Park in Brooklyn and was captured on at least two videos – one from the street and one from above – that were shared widely on social media. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he's calling for the state Attorney General to investigate the conduct of police officers in several videos that surfaced over the past few days including the one involving the SUVs. He said he wants a report within 30 days. ""I'm telling [city officials] that if the review looks at those videos and finds improper conduct, there will be ramifications,"" Cuomo said but did not specify what the consequences would be. Story continues below gallery While some condemned the actions of the officers, Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the officers saying their safety was threatened by the crowd. “Look, I’ve seen that video, and I’ve obviously heard about a number of other instances -– it’s inappropriate for protestors to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,"" de Blasio said at a news conference late Saturday. ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles, and if a police officer is [in] that situation they have to get out that situation,"" he said. He added that ""the video was upsetting, and I wish the officers hadn’t done that. But I also understood that they didn’t start the situation. The situation was started by a group of protestors converging on a police vehicle, attacking that vehicle, it’s unacceptable."" The overhead video begins with a shot of an NYPD SUV being blocked by demonstrators with a metal barrier. A bag of garbage, a traffic cone and cans are thrown at the SUV. A second NYPD SUV then drives around the blocked one and then slowly pushes through the crowd who bang on it. The first SUV then jolts forward pushing several demonstrators to the ground. At least one demonstrator then jumps on the hood of the first SUV before the video ends. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, said the officers could have killed many demonstrators.

Camden County Police took part in a Saturday unity walk, alongside local clergy and community leaders, ""to stand in solidarity and unity with all residents who are rightfully angered, concerned and upset about the actions of the officers in Minneapolis and the murder of George Floyd,"" Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in a written statement. Derek Chauvin, 44, was fired from his job as a Minneapolis police officer this week, and charged with Floyd's murder on Friday. Widely circulated video shows the former officer with his knee to Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes, as Floyd, on the ground and in handcuffs, told the officer he couldn't breathe before falling unresponsive. Wysocki continued: ""We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue. When our officers are deployed on the street and in the neighborhoods they are committed to preserving the sanctity of life and building a stronger city."" Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli said the event was a result of years of direct interaction, relationship building and community policing. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka joined a march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, in protest against the police killing of Floyd. Trenton drew a crowd of a few hundred, where a roughly 90-minute protest included speeches, a march and a candlelight vigil, as reported by Planet Princeton, In Morris County, a funeral car procession and vigil was organized by Black Lives Matter Morristown, in remembrance of Floyd. A photo from Camden's unity walk also was shared Sunday by Gov. Phil Murphy, who said ""Yesterday in New Jersey, protestors marched side by side with law enforcement, in peaceful demonstration against systemic racism and police violence. We can – we MUST – march toward justice together."" “The horror that unfolded in Minneapolis is painful for us all. The actions that we saw on video are contrary to all our training and does harm to the good reputation of the overwhelming number of brave men and women in law enforcement trying to do their job in an honorable and lawful manner,"" State Policemen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan said in a written statement Saturday. He continued ""Nobody in law enforcement can look at that video and justify the actions of those officers."" “We condemn the actions of the officer involved, Derek Chauvin, as well as the inaction of the officers that stood by and let George Floyd die,"" Colligan said. Colligan also said ""Please remember that the 900,000 members of law enforcement will have direct contact with over 53 million of our citizens a year throughout this country. We must support the overwhelming number of good officers on the street trying to do their jobs in an honorable and lawful manner. We cannot abandon our police at this time."" In Philadelphia, 13 police officers were injured as protests turned violent Saturday, according to the city's police department. Looting and vandalism in the Center City area of Philadelphia continued late into the evening as the city imposed an 8 p.m. curfer. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday evening signed a disaster emergency declaration, providing ""all necessary assistance,"" including the state National Guard and Pennsylvania State Police, in dealing with the escalation of protests in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Wolf said. “This emergency declaration will help Philadelphia access resources and police support from other jurisdictions, including other states, as we manage the impact of this weekend’s demonstrations,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in the same statement released by Wolf's office. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw held a news conference Sunday, where she said peaceful protesters would be encouraged to act within their rights, while she said outright acts of violence were disrespectful and would not be tolerated. ""There's other ways to address this,"" Outlaw said, adding: ""It's people coming in from outside the city, who are tearing up the city."" Violence also broke out during protests in New York City, where police said 345 people were arrested, 33 officers were injured and 27 police vehicles were damaged. No major injuries were reported. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday that city police showed “tremendous restraint overall” but that he was concerned about video showing two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street. The mayor said he would appoint two city officials to carry out an independent review of how the protests unfolded and how they were handled by the police.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo echoed those thoughts at his daily briefing in Albany, saying, “It is not a coincidence that the protests are happening in the middle of a pandemic.” Dr. Theodore Long, who is leading New York City’s contact tracing efforts with its public hospitals agency, urged anyone who had been involved in the demonstrations to get tested for the virus and to protect themselves while out. “We strongly encourage anybody who is out in the protests to wear a mask, practice proper hand hygiene and to the extent possible, socially distance, though we know that’s not always going to be feasible,” Dr. Long said. Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, also strongly defended people’s right to protest on the streets. But he did express concern about how the protests could increase the spread of the virus. “We need to pay attention 7 to 10 days from now to any spikes that we can see,” Mr. Williams said. “We have to be careful, but I don’t think we can tell people, watch someone get killed on camera again, and stay home,” Mr. Williams said.",0.0

Floyd, who was arrested for alleged forgery and wasn’t armed, later died. On Saturday, thousands of people marched through the streets of Newark chanting “No justice, no peace!"" and “I can’t breathe” in a stand against racism and police brutality, a peaceful protest compared to violence seen in other major U.S. cities. In Camden, Police Chief Joseph D. Wysocki walked side-by-side with demonstrators. Among the other protests planned in New Jersey: A protest in Trenton, “Justice for George Floyd,” is planned from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, according to PlanetPrinceton.com Demonstrators in Atlantic City are meeting at the Public Safety Building on Atlantic Avenue at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

In a statement Saturday, New Jersey State PBA President Pat Colligan condemned Chauvin and the four officers also at the scene. “The actions that we saw on video are contrary to all our training and does harm to the good reputation of the overwhelming number of brave men and women in law enforcement trying to do their job in an honorable and lawful manner,"" Colligan said. “Nobody in law enforcement can look at that video and justify the actions of those officers.” Our journalism needs your support.

Emotional, respectful and impactful, that is what the Black Lives Matter Morristown vigil mourning the death of George Floyd was. Floyd, 46, died Monday after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on his neck for several minutes while three other officers looked on. Video footage of the arrest, in which Floyd is heard saying ""I can't breathe,"" spread widely online, and all four officers were fired. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Friday. Mourners in Morristown came from all over Morris County and beyond, and even those who could not attend offered messages of support. Including Morristown Mayor Tim Dougherty. ""Although I will not be able to attend this evenings candlelight vigil in honor of George Floyd, I stand strongly with this effort. Both my wife and I will take a moment of silence tonight and mourn the loss of Mr. Floyd and those we have lost to such senseless and reprehensible acts of brutality,"" he said in a statement. ""I am encouraged by the Black Lives Matter movement and their work to bring these matters and the trauma caused by such acts to the forefront of discussions within our community."" Video courtesy of Ela Ravin Video courtesy of Ela Ravin Video courtesy of Ela Ravin More Reaction Morris County Prosecutor Fredric M. Knapp shared his own thoughts in the wake of Floyd's death, reminding the public that they investigate all complaints regarding public officials, public employees and police officers. ""During my tenure as Morris County Prosecutor, I have always made investigating and prosecuting bias crime as a top priority. No resident of Morris County should be made to feel unwelcome in this great county, and members of this office take every reported incident seriously,"" Knapp said, noting he attended a virtual discussion with members of the Calvary Baptist Church. ""It was a powerful and emotional evening. I realize emotions are running high during what are already challenging times."" Morris Township Chief of Police Mark DiCarlo said he felt responsible to acknowledge the ""horrific incident"" and offered condolences to the family, friends and relatives of George Floyd on behalf of his department. ""We do not condone those actions and behaviors,"" he said. ""Please know that our officers are continuously and consistently training on topics pertaining to racial profiling, harassment, ethics, cultural diversity, use of force, dealing with mental illness and substance abuse to name a few. As an Agency, we have provided tools and equipment to our officers in order to have alternatives to the use of deadly force as well as teach de-escalation techniques."" DiCarlo also noted the diversification of personnel, many of which grew up in the community. ""As we move forward in a positive direction from this incident, our police department will focus on building and maintaining our positive relationship with our residents,"" he said. ""We are committed to solidarity and not division. We are your police department and we ask for your assistance in growing with you."" Beyond Morristown Madison Mayor Robert H. Conley, Chief Darren P. Dachisen Sr. and Madison Police Chaplain Reverend A. Craig Dunn of Madison First Baptist Church issued a joint statement the death of Floyd. ""The horrific footage of the incident that recently occurred in Minneapolis is inconsistent and contrary to all that we, Madison and Madison Police Department, have not only learned while attending police academy, but what we have learned as human beings. What is depicted in the footage is not who MPD is as law enforcement professionals. We are equally disturbed and saddened to see the other officers on the scene not interject and prevent the tragic loss of life,"" the statement said. ""Madison Police Department (MPD) is an accredited agency, which not only requires the continuous training on topics like racial profiling, harassment, ethics, cultural diversity, use of force, dealing with mental illness and substance abuse to name a few."" The department also has to track and have an early warning system in place to alert command staff to use of force patterns and/or trends, officials said. ""We will not allow what occurred in Minneapolis to tarnish the relationship with the residents of Madison, that MPD has focused on growing over the years through community outreach programs like National Night Out,"" the statement said. ""On behalf of the Borough of Madison, our deepest sympathies go out to Mr. Floyd's family during this unbearable time."" County Prosecutors from Mercer, Hudson, Monmouth, Burlington, Cap May, Sussex and Cumberland County also released a statement on behalf of the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey. ""In New Jersey, the law enforcement community is fortunate to have developed a positive relationship with our residents. Our police officers and state troopers routinely conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism and respect for the members of the communities they serve. This has been particularly apparent over the past few months as our officers have managed the added responsibility of enforcing significant restrictions on our normal activities with sensitivity to the stress that our residents are experiencing in the midst of this public health crisis,"" the statement said. ""We believe that New Jersey is home to some of the finest law enforcement officers in the country. The County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey is committed to ensuring that members of our local, county and state police forces provide fair treatment and justice to all our residents."" The Prosecutors' statement also credited Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal with progressive policies, and he shared his own thoughts. ""Mr. Floyd's death reminds us that our country has a long way to go not only in healing our nation's racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that prevent all Americans from equally securing our country's great promises. Now more than ever, we must redouble our commitment to building trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, especially those from historically marginalized communities,"" Grewal said. ""The residents of New Jersey should rest assured that we will never tolerate the types of police practices that resulted in Mr. Floyd's death."" There were also protests in Camden and Newark on Saturday. Thousands of protesters filled Market Street on Saturday to protest police brutality. Signs listing the names of black men and women who died at the hands of police lined posters and T-shirts. George Floyd's name was shouted alongside the chant ""I can't breathe."" The People's Organization for Progress, the group that organized the protest, and leader Larry Hamm urged the community to use their voice to bring about change in Newark. Advocating for a citizens review board in Newark, Hamm said the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 12 has repeatedly blocked the move in the courts.  ""If you really want accountability, we need you to call the state Supreme Court on Monday,"" Hamm said, ""Every village in this state and in this country should have a civilian oversight board for the police."" Hamm noted that systemic change and the fight for equality would be a long one, in Newark and across the country. ""It took 50 years of protesting to try to get a review board,"" Hamm said, noting the cities history of protesting police brutality. ""But if those of us here could unite into a movement, we would be the most powerful movement in the state of New Jersey,"" Hamm exclaimed to a cheerful crowd. Violence Nearby Not far from home, in New York and Pennsylvania, there were riots and incidents of violence Saturday. A disaster emergency was declared in Philadelphia as the city and the suburbs handled riots and looting late Saturday and early Sunday protesting the death of George Floyd. A total of 22 individuals were arrested in the city, and 13 police officers were injured, authorities said. The aftermath of the riots — which began as a peaceful demonstration at along the Parkway — left Walnut and Chestnut streets and parts of the surrounding neighborhoods strewn with clumps of trash, as this clip from the Philadelphia Inquirer shows. Expletives were scrawled in graffiti across the fronts of shops and the sides of buildings. Numerous storefronts were damaged or destroyed. Broken glass coated parts of the sidewalk and streets.\ Several fires were set, including a three-alarm blaze which raged at 17th and Walnut at around 10 p.m. It was not put out until 1 a.m., the Philadelphia Fire Department said. Around 120 firefighers responded to the fire. In New York City, thousands of New Yorkers took to the city's streets again Saturday in a third day of furious protests following the death of Minnesota man George Floyd. Rallies popped up in Harlem, Times Square, Union Square, on the West Side Highway, on the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges, at the Barclays Center, in Flatbush and at several other sites throughout the city. Similar scenes were being seen right across the United States. Hundreds have been arrested over the days of protest, including several who were expected to be charged Saturday night or Sunday with throwing Molotov cocktails in Brooklyn Friday night. One of the devices was hurled by a woman at a police vehicle carrying four officers, law enforcement sources said. Many officers have been hurt during the protest, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said, including some who had teeth knocked out. ""It is by the grace of God that we don't have dead officers today,"" he said Saturday.  This story contains reporting by Kara Seymour, Samantha Mercado, Adam Nichols and Justin Heinze.

But in Morristown, and throughout North Jersey, the scenes were peaceful. ""The events that led to George Floyd’s death are glaringly clear. All over America, we are mourning. We are mourning the life of too many lives lost too for no other reason than they are people of color. We are scared, we are tired and we are grieving,"" said Kisha Pinnock, an attorney and social justice activist who participated in the procession.

Candles and flashlights lit up the field as nearly 300 people came to show their support. As she addressed the crowd, Kimbrough recalled previous instances of police brutality against the black community. She said she was ""tired"" as she remembered the killings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and Floyd. The evening continued with speakers Rabbi Allison Miller of Morristown Unitarian Fellowship and Pastor Charles Perez of the United Methodist Church. Local residents lined up their cars for a funeral procession in Morristown demanding justice for George Floyd and an end to police brutality.

At least 5,000 people gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln at the foot of Newark's historic courthouse.

That's why Susie Dellarocca and her boyfriend, Gio Giomarelli, were out with two friends to assist in the cleanup efforts. ""I've lived here for seven years, two blocks away,"" Dellarocca said. ""It feels really personal."" The couple live near 20th and Walnut, not far from where dozens of businesses were harmed and a three-alarm fire roared Saturday night. Their front window was protected by wood, but Giomarelli stayed on guard in the living room for protection as Dellarocca slept in the couple's bedroom. ""I didn't sleep,"" Giomarelli said. ""I just kept watching the news."" The group of friends spent part of the morning cleaning up outside a Wells Fargo bank at 15th and Chestnut streets. Said Giomarelli: ""Someone came up to us and said, 'What are you cleaning up for? We'll be back again tonight.'"" Contact Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.

Camden County Police took part in a Saturday unity walk, alongside local clergy and community leaders, ""to stand in solidarity and unity with all residents who are rightfully angered, concerned and upset about the actions of the officers in Minneapolis and the murder of George Floyd,"" Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in a written statement. Derek Chauvin, 44, was fired from his job as a Minneapolis police officer this week, and charged with Floyd's murder on Friday. Widely circulated video shows the former officer with his knee to Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes, as Floyd, on the ground and in handcuffs, told the officer he couldn't breathe before falling unresponsive. Wysocki continued: ""We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue. When our officers are deployed on the street and in the neighborhoods they are committed to preserving the sanctity of life and building a stronger city."" Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli said the event was a result of years of direct interaction, relationship building and community policing. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka joined a march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, in protest against the police killing of Floyd. Trenton drew a crowd of a few hundred, where a roughly 90-minute protest included speeches, a march and a candlelight vigil, as reported by Planet Princeton, In Morris County, a funeral car procession and vigil was organized by Black Lives Matter Morristown, in remembrance of Floyd. A photo from Camden's unity walk also was shared Sunday by Gov. Phil Murphy, who said ""Yesterday in New Jersey, protestors marched side by side with law enforcement, in peaceful demonstration against systemic racism and police violence. We can – we MUST – march toward justice together."" “The horror that unfolded in Minneapolis is painful for us all. The actions that we saw on video are contrary to all our training and does harm to the good reputation of the overwhelming number of brave men and women in law enforcement trying to do their job in an honorable and lawful manner,"" State Policemen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan said in a written statement Saturday. He continued ""Nobody in law enforcement can look at that video and justify the actions of those officers."" “We condemn the actions of the officer involved, Derek Chauvin, as well as the inaction of the officers that stood by and let George Floyd die,"" Colligan said. Colligan also said ""Please remember that the 900,000 members of law enforcement will have direct contact with over 53 million of our citizens a year throughout this country. We must support the overwhelming number of good officers on the street trying to do their jobs in an honorable and lawful manner. We cannot abandon our police at this time."" In Philadelphia, 13 police officers were injured as protests turned violent Saturday, according to the city's police department. Looting and vandalism in the Center City area of Philadelphia continued late into the evening as the city imposed an 8 p.m. curfer. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday evening signed a disaster emergency declaration, providing ""all necessary assistance,"" including the state National Guard and Pennsylvania State Police, in dealing with the escalation of protests in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. “People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it’s unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property,” Wolf said. “This emergency declaration will help Philadelphia access resources and police support from other jurisdictions, including other states, as we manage the impact of this weekend’s demonstrations,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in the same statement released by Wolf's office. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw held a news conference Sunday, where she said peaceful protesters would be encouraged to act within their rights, while she said outright acts of violence were disrespectful and would not be tolerated. ""There's other ways to address this,"" Outlaw said, adding: ""It's people coming in from outside the city, who are tearing up the city."" Violence also broke out during protests in New York City, where police said 345 people were arrested, 33 officers were injured and 27 police vehicles were damaged. No major injuries were reported. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday that city police showed “tremendous restraint overall” but that he was concerned about video showing two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street. The mayor said he would appoint two city officials to carry out an independent review of how the protests unfolded and how they were handled by the police.

It's unclear if there were injuries. Storyful Two New York Police Department vehicles plowed into demonstrators rallying against police brutality Saturday as the crowd pushed a barricade against one of them and pelted it with objects. The incident occurred near Prospect Park in Brooklyn and was captured on at least two videos – one from the street and one from above – that were shared widely on social media. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he's calling for the state Attorney General to investigate the conduct of police officers in several videos that surfaced over the past few days including the one involving the SUVs. He said he wants a report within 30 days. ""I'm telling [city officials] that if the review looks at those videos and finds improper conduct, there will be ramifications,"" Cuomo said but did not specify what the consequences would be. Story continues below gallery While some condemned the actions of the officers, Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the officers saying their safety was threatened by the crowd. “Look, I’ve seen that video, and I’ve obviously heard about a number of other instances -– it’s inappropriate for protestors to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,"" de Blasio said at a news conference late Saturday. ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles, and if a police officer is [in] that situation they have to get out that situation,"" he said. He added that ""the video was upsetting, and I wish the officers hadn’t done that. But I also understood that they didn’t start the situation. The situation was started by a group of protestors converging on a police vehicle, attacking that vehicle, it’s unacceptable."" The overhead video begins with a shot of an NYPD SUV being blocked by demonstrators with a metal barrier. A bag of garbage, a traffic cone and cans are thrown at the SUV. A second NYPD SUV then drives around the blocked one and then slowly pushes through the crowd who bang on it. The first SUV then jolts forward pushing several demonstrators to the ground. At least one demonstrator then jumps on the hood of the first SUV before the video ends. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, said the officers could have killed many demonstrators. She criticized de Blasio for his comments. @NYCMayor your comments tonight were unacceptable.  As mayor, this police department is under your leadership.  This moment demands leadership & accountability from each of us. Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong.  Make it right. De-escalate. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 31, 2020 ""This moment demands leadership & accountability from each of us,"" she wrote in a tweet. ""Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong."" Police Commissioner Dermot Shea didn't directly address the incident. But in a tweet posted on Sunday morning, Shea told his officers that he is ""extremely proud of the way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger, disrespect, and denigration"" via a tweet Sunday morning. To the Members of the NYPD:  What you’ve endured these last couple of days and nights—like much of 2020, so far—was unprecedented. In no small way, I want you to know that I’m extremely proud of the way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger... pic.twitter.com/1ez0Ar17Ex — Commissioner Shea (@NYPDShea) May 31, 2020 ""What it was, quite frankly, was a mob bent solely on taking advantage of a moment in American history, to co-opt the cause of equality that we all must uphold, to intentionally inflict chaos, mayhem, and injury just for the sake of doing so,"" Shea wrote. Protests continued for the third consecutive night Saturday. It was the city's worst day of unrest in decades as fires burned, windows got smashed and dangerous confrontations between demonstrators and officers flared. New York City police said 345 people were arrested, 33 officers were injured and 27 police vehicles were damaged. Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

The line, painted in 2016, represents solidarity with the police but Kimbrough's act was in defiance of that solidarity and part of the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Morristown. Residents of all ages and races gathered to call for an end to police brutality and demand justice for George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin earlier this week. Hundreds lined up their cars on Saturday in Morristown to demand justice for George Floyd and an end police brutality.

Hundreds of cars stretched from the packed Morristown High School parking lot up to the Green, coordinated in part by Morristown nonprofit Wind of the Spirit. Police escorted the procession through Morristown and onto Woodland Avenue in Morris Township. They continued in a ""funeral procession"" to the Morris Township police department and a candlelight vigil at Ginty Field. Cars displayed signs calling for justice for Floyd as well as his last words before his death, ""I can't breathe."" Hundreds of residents drove through Morristown to demand justice for George Floyd after he died at the hands of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. (Photo: Kisha Pinnock) The death of Floyd on Monday in Minneapolis sparked a firestorm of protests and riots throughout the country, with scenes of violence unfolding on social media and TV screens. But in Morristown, and throughout North Jersey, the scenes were peaceful. ""The events that led to George Floyd’s death are glaringly clear. All over America, we are mourning.

We are scared, we are tired and we are grieving,"" said Kisha Pinnock, an attorney and social justice activist who participated in the procession.

Candles and flashlights lit up the field as nearly 300 people came to show their support. As she addressed the crowd, Kimbrough recalled previous instances of police brutality against the black community. She said she was ""tired"" as she remembered the killings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and Floyd. The evening continued with speakers Rabbi Allison Miller of Morristown Unitarian Fellowship and Pastor Charles Perez of the United Methodist Church. Local residents lined up their cars for a funeral procession in Morristown demanding justice for George Floyd and an end to police brutality.

At least 5,000 people gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln at the foot of Newark's historic courthouse. ""I am proud that the citizens of the greater Morristown area, people across all races came together in solidarity,"" Pinnock said. ""It filled my heart. It is not enough to not be racist.

It is expected to be a caravan of cars with signs “for George Floyd and all the brothers and sisters we lost to police brutality and vigilante type slayings,” said Ashton Burrell, organizer and national community activist. “George Floyd was a brother, friend, companion and most importantly a person,” Burrell said. “On May 25, George’s life was prematurely taken from him by individuals who should be saving lives instead of taking them. The time for change is now and the people will wait no longer for justice.” The focus of the Highland Park demonstration will be ensuring that “George Floyd and all people of color receive fair justice,” Burrell said.

And aside from clashes between police and rioters in Atlantic City and Trenton late Sunday, the violence that spread across the nation in the wake of the George Floyd killing barely touched New Jersey's largest cities this weekend. Four large rallies held Saturday in Newark, Paterson, Camden and Englewood were largely peaceful with tens of thousands taking to the streets to protest Floyd's death by a police officer and other instances of police brutality. On Monday, a rally and march in Jersey City was also peaceful. The same occured in Asbury Park until late Monday when police cleared the streets of protesters two hours after a citywide curfew went into effect and made arrests including an Asbury Park Press reporter. One of the factors cited for the peaceful display was the participation by civic leaders and even police in some of the marches and rallies. In Newark, the rally was arranged by the longstanding group People's Organization for Progress with the help of city officials. ""People would have thought something was wrong if there was no rally,"" said Mayor Ras Baraka, who has marched with the group long before taking office.

The same scene was on display in Camden, long one of the nation's poorest cities. While Philadelphia descended into chaos across the Delaware River, the rally in Camden was a concerted effort at uniting police and community.

Sunday saw a mixed bag. In Long Branch, police clapped as protesters marched past them chanted George Floyd's name. But in Trenton and Atlantic City, order broke down. Rioters looted several stores at a strip mall in Atlantic City and clashed with police. In Trenton, violence sprang as the sun went down and several police cruisers were lit on fire. It was a stark contrast to Englewood's rally on Saturday, which was so peaceful that some demonstrators even brought their young children. The rally drew residents from neighboring towns including Teaneck, the scene of protests in 1990 when Phillip Panell, a black teen, was shot and killed by a white police officer. A police cruiser led off the march through the heart of downtown before concluding at the city's police station. Some of the things I saw today at the protest in Englewood, NJ.

Authorities last year said autopsy results revealed Lowery died from the interaction between drugs he took and a pre-existing medical condition. But the rage was eventually subdued by Revs. Allan Boyer and Michael D. McDuffie who began praying for the family of Floyd and all those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.

The Newark rally featured a few tense moments Saturday when demonstrators broke away and confronted police at a local precinct but there was no violence. The Newark riots of 1967, which destroyed large sections of the city and caused decades of spiraling economic decay, was incited after two white police officers beat up a black cab driver. The city is very much different now with black leadership and more minorities on the police force. For Baraka, the march was something he and many others in power embraced. ""We have to give people the room to be outraged,"" Baraka said. ""This is not just about Floyd.

Asbury Park Press LONG BRANCH - Their chants sounded through Pier Village and across the city. ""I can't breathe!"" ""Black lives matter!"" Hundreds of people gathered at the oceanside shopping plaza on Sunday afternoon where they held banners and chanted in a unity rally to draw attention to George Floyd's death while in police custody and police brutality against people of color. They marched from Pier Village, chanting and holding banners that said ""Justice for George Floyd"" and ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" ""I'm here because I have a 17-year-old black son, and I don't want him to die by the hands of a police officer who's supposed to protect him or by someone who's privileged and thinks because he's black, he's a threat to them,"" said Shaneale Brown, 35, of Long Branch. ""He's not (a threat). He's a human being like everyone else. ... He would never deserve to be treated the way they treated George Floyd, or these kids and men who were killed because of the color of their skin."" Floyd, 46, died last week in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Some of his final words, caught on camera, were ""I can't breathe."" Those words have become a rallying cry against racism and police brutality, not only at Long Branch's march, but across the United States.

Several hundred peaceful protesters marched from Pier Village to the steps of the Long Branch Police Department. Sunday, May 31, 2020 photo/James J. Connolly/Correspondent (Photo: James J.

Although some rallies across the nation pitted police against protesters and devolved into violence, Long Branch's rally was held with the help of city police. Officers provided an escort for the marchers and traffic control as they made their way through Long Branch to police headquarters. City resident Ty-Kiera Brown, 27, a member of the Greater Long Branch NAACP, said she was moved by George Floyd's death and came to the rally to send the message to other African-Americans that she was supporting them. ""Our lives do matter,"" she said. Buy Photo Protest against police brutality in the wake of the George Floyd killing.

Warner Iveris and his husband grabbed the few supplies they had in their home — a broom and a dustpan — and came over to help clean up with other volunteers working near the looted Villa apparel store off East Main Street. They stopped by some of their other favorite businesses on their way over to make sure each one was OK. “We were concerned because we could see on the news (the damage to) this place right around the corner from us,” Iveris said. “This is where we live, you know? I’d like to get it back to normal, as soon as we can, and help just repair the damage.” Others took it upon themselves to guard the places they frequent. Three people stood outside a corner store on Lexington Avenue, broken glass and half-empty boxes of candy and bubble gum at their feet, and quietly talked about what they had heard Saturday night. They’d tried calling the owner, they said. Couldn’t reach him, so they’d decided to sit and wait for him to come by. The store is one of the only places to get groceries within walking distance for them and they didn’t want anyone coming by and stealing anything else. The city of Rochester organized the citywide cleanup beginning at 10 a.m. at Frontier Field — the Ibero-American Action League coordinated work from the Father Tracy Center — while some people associated with the original Black Lives Matter protest already had been planning to gather downtown. ""At a moment’s notice those individuals came (from) ... all across this community picking up glass, boarding up windows, making sure that our neighborhoods are safe and sound,” Warren said later. “That’s the Rochester that we know and that we love.” The volunteers were joined Sunday by 200 state troopers, dispatched by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to be on hand in case there is further violence Sunday night. The Rochester Police Department was stretched to capacity Saturday, particularly after some of its cruisers were destroyed. ""For tonight, Rochester has asked for 200 additional police so we’ll do that,” Gov. Cuomo said at a press briefing Sunday. “If we need more, we have the National Guard. It’s just making sure we have resources to adjust to situations."" The Rochester Police Department said 13 people were arrested Saturday evening on charges including burglary and obstruction of justice. Chief La'Ron Singletary and Mayor Lovely Warren said more arrests will be forthcoming. Warren said that the destruction, which gutted many services and businesses used by black families and that grandmothers, mothers and children would now suffer because of the loss of access to stores. The violence and looting came after, and separate from, a well attended peaceful protest against racial injustice, particularly the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. Another countywide curfew will go into effect at 9 p.m. Sunday into early Monday. Throughout the city, vandalized buildings drew a steady stream of onlookers. People walked by boarded-up storefronts and stepped carefully over shards of glass, aiming their phones at the wreckage. At Rainbow, a clothing store on Lake Avenue completely ransacked on Saturday evening, an employee from Genesee Mirror and Glass walked around the property, measuring each cracked window and carefully removing pieces of broken glass. He stopped what he was doing several times to answer his phone and tell the caller on the other end that no, he couldn’t help them, and no, he’d be busy for a very long time. Around 10:30 a.m., Danielle Tucker walked up to the store and lifted her camera up to her eye to take a photo of it. Photography is a beloved hobby of hers, she said, but she felt compelled to document Saturday’s protest and Sunday’s cleanup process. “I’m not saying that this is peaceful,” Tucker said. “These people that are going into stores like this, they’re not angry and they’re not getting their pain out by going to loot Rainbow. However, it ignited with that one incident and … it’s related. We need to feel this."" Moments later, Chris Bell of Action for a Better Community walked over — also with a digital camera in his hands. The two talked about the reasons they were drawn to the scene and how they felt George Floyd’s death sparked national outrage and, hopefully, some change. “Unfortunately it had to take so much damage and it had to hit our pockets the way it did,” Tucker said. “However, something good’s going to come out of it.”",0.0

1621824144,2020-05-31 16:34:40,Target says it will temporarily close stores in several states as protests continue,https://whyy.org/npr_story_post/target-says-it-will-temporarily-close-stores-in-several-states-as-protests-continue/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"Amid continuing protests over the death of George Floyd, Target has temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores nationwide. The announcement on Saturday from the nation’s eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis located near the city’s 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd’s death worked. The station was damaged by a fire last week. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. “At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores.” A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota, and in California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. “The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,” Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. “We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts.” It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target’s past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the “genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.”",0.0

""Unfortunately, the peaceful protest that took place earlier by many has transitioned to criminal activity now taking place by a few. If you can, avoid Atlantic City at this time,"" Atlantic City Police shared on Twitter around 6:30 p.m. Atlantic City Office of Emergency Management enacted an overnight curfew from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. ""During this time, only those individuals that are traveling to or from work or seeking medial/police assistance will be permitted. All others are subject to arrest,"" the city's OEM announced. Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Amy Rosenberg shared video to her Twitter feed of attempted looting at several stores at the Tangers Outlet, as seen in the clip below. In Trenton, a similar turning point was caught on Facebook live by Maurice Lennon. After protestors marched downtown, even joined at one point by Trenton police officers who took a knee in apparent solidarity, sporadic violence began, including broken windows at a Bank of America and the looting of a Snipes sneaker store, as seen in Lennon's video. Earlier Sunday, other social media users posted video of the peaceful march down the Atlantic City boardwalk, in honor of George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died under the knee of a since fired Minneapolis police officer. Rosenberg also shared a video clip of Atlantic City Police Chaplain Eric McCoy, who told the reporter that people “want to be heard” and have to figure out how to take care of each other. Information on potential injuries or arrests was not immediately known, shortly after the curfew began. Other protests across New Jersey earlier in the weekend had been largely peaceful. Among those attracting the most attention was in Camden County, where police took part in a Saturday unity walk, ""to stand in solidarity and unity with all residents who are rightfully angered, concerned and upset about the actions of the officers in Minneapolis and the murder of George Floyd,"" Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in a written statement. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka also marched Saturday with protestors organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress. More from New Jersey 101.5:",0.0

Phil Murphy said Friday the black Minnesota man who died in police custody “should be alive today"" and lamented that America is still plagued by a “centuries-old stain of systemic racism” that won’t be erased simply by firing the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck. “It may seem half-a-country away, but we’re all in this boat together,” Murphy, a Democrat, said during his daily coronavirus briefing in Trenton. “There is no doubt that the centuries-old stain of systemic racism is far from being erased from the fabric of this country.” The comments came just as news broke Friday afternoon that Derek Chauvin, the officer at the center of the firestorm, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Chauvin, 44, who is white, was caught on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck during a May 25 arrest in Minneapolis. Floyd, a black 46-year-old, died after pleading with Chauvin that he couldn’t breathe and even though bystanders begged Chauvin and three other officers at the scene to back off Floyd. All four officers were fired Tuesday. The incident has sparked days of unrest in Minnesota’s largest city, with some protestors rioting and setting fire to a local police station Thursday night. Meanwhile, a New Jersey grassroots political group is staging a protest Saturday in Newark over Floyd’s death. Murphy — head of the national Democratic Governors Association — said Friday that “the overwhelming majority of our law enforcement officers believe strongly in the communities they have sworn to protect.” “But what we are seeing right now in Minneapolis is painful — almost too painful — to watch,” the New Jersey governor said. “And perhaps that’s because it’s not the first time we have seen such horrific pictures on our screens.” “George Floyd should be alive today,” Murphy added. “Not just as a matter of principle or justice, but as a matter of human dignity — as a matter of our nation living up to one of the most basic of our founding ideals ‘that all are created equal.’ His life mattered as much as mine, or Tammy’s, or our kids’, or any one of yours.” Murphy invoked past incidents in which black people died at the hands of white police officers. “Too many times have we gotten a national wake-up and done nothing,” he said. “We cannot just expect someone to be fired and that be the end of it. That’s just a feel-good action that doesn’t solve a systemic problem.” “We need to dig a deeper well of accountability and responsibility, and we need to draw from it — not just in Minneapolis, but everywhere,” the governor added. Meanwhile, Col. Patrick Callahan, head of the New Jersey State Police said he’s “always deeply troubled by the tragic loss of life, especially when law enforcement is involved.” “In-custody deaths and officer-involved shootings are some of the most complex, intense investigations that need to be rooted in accountability and in justice and in transparency,” Callahan said. Asked if the force the Minneapolis officer used on Floyd would be allowed under New Jersey’s police conduct rules, Callahan said: “I’m unable to comment on an investigation in New Jersey in my own agency. And I would take that same position with regards to an investigation in another city in another state.” In addition, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal called the charges against Chauvin “an important first step in the search for justice.” “Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go not only in healing our nation’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that prevent all Americans from equally securing our country’s great promises,"" Grewal said. “The residents of New Jersey should rest assured that we will never tolerate the types of police practices that resulted in Mr. Floyd’s death,” he added. New Jersey officials are investigating an incident in which a State Police troopers fatally shot a 28-year-old New York man on the Garden State Parkway in Bass River earlier this month. The man later died from his wounds. Murphy and Callahan declined to comment Friday on that shooting. As the Minnesota riots continued Thursday night, President Donald Trump tweeted that there is a “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis, called protesters “thugs"" who are “dishonoring” Floyd’s memory, and said the U.S. military may have to “assume control"" of the city. ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” the Republican president added. ....These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Twitter later said thee tweet violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Trump tweeted Friday that his “shooting” comment was “spoken as a fact, not as a statement.” ....It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement.

The People’s Organization for Progress, which was formed to eradicate racism and take on relevant social issues, will protest beginning at 1 p.m. at the Lincoln statue, located at West Market Street and Springfield Avenue. Protesters are asked to arrive by 12:45 p.m. ALSO: Other protests over George Floyd’s death at police hands spreading across N.J. The group met via teleconference Thursday night and decided unanimously to protest, inviting the public to attend, according to its chairman, Larry Hamm. “The circumstances of Mr. Floyd’s death were horrific,” Hamm said. “We’re encouraging every person who is outraged about this murder to join us.” Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. Floyd, who was not armed and did not appear to be resisting arrest, was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Four police officers who were at the scene have been fired. Floyd’s family and many across the country who are outraged by the killing have called for the former cops to be arrested. The death sparked nationwide protests, many of them turning violent. In Minnesota, the protests continued on Friday with widespread looting and arson. In New York, dozens of protesters were arrested this week. Hamm said The People’s Organization for Progress includes among its goals advocating human and civil rights and promoting world peace. Everyone who participates in Saturday’s protest is asked to wear a face mask, gloves and to practice social distancing.

Kaepernick is one of the world’s most polarizing athletes going back to 2016, when he first took a knee in protest of social injustices in the U.S. On Thursday, Kaepernick tweeted his reaction to Floyd’s death, which served as a call to action. “When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction.

1621894980,2020-05-29 00:00:00,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.nj.com/news/2020/05/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest.html,en,True,,20120,nj.com,http://www.nj.com,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, ""in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. ""Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis ""thugs,"" drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform's rules about ""glorifying violence."" A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights"" and called for their immediate release. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was ""here with the Minneapolis Fire Department"" to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's ""Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. ""Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,"" tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at ""every single protest"" since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. ""We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,"" she said. ""We just want the police officer to be held accountable."" The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. ""WHY US?"" demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. ""We're burning our own neighborhood,"" said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. ""This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it."" No officers could be seen beyond the station. ""What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,"" Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,"" said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. ""They're making money off of us,"" he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. ""I didn't break anything."" The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected ""continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA."" In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the ""total elimination"" of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. The Republican on Twitter asked ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" and in a follow-up tweet said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting ""a robust criminal investigation"" into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com.",0.0

There was no more information on charging, because that’s in the jurisdiction of the Hennepin County attorney, Harrington said. County Attorney Mike Freeman announced a news conference for 1 p.m. Friday at the Ridgedale Public Library to announce a “major development” in the case. Harrington only mentioned that one officer had been arrested; no word yet on the other three Minneapolis police officers who have been fired. A somber Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowed to restore order Friday after a third night of protests and violence in response to George Floyd’s death in police custody led to the breach and destruction of a Minneapolis police precinct and dozens of other buildings across the city. “What the world has witnessed since the killing of George Floyd on Monday has been a visceral pain, a community trying to understand who we are and where we go from here,” he said. “We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues, before we turn back to where we should be spending our energy: making sure justice is served.” Walz, who activated the National Guard on Thursday to respond to the unrest, acknowledged that the rampage that left hundreds of stores looted and a major Minneapolis police precinct house torched was “one of our darkest chapters.” He also called authorities’ inability to control the widespread fires and vandalism Thursday night “an abject failure.” He also publicly apologized to CNN President Jeff Zucker for the arrests of a television crew that had been covering the protests on Lake Street early Friday. Walz said he spoke to Zucker and immediately intervened to release the journalists, who were arrested on live television. “I take full responsibility,” Walz said, adding that the TV crew’s detention by State Patrol had been “inexcusable.” Jon Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said there was a lack of clarity on the “mission” of the Guard in responding to the protests ahead of time. He had some concerns before were even dispatched. “We never got such mission description.” Walz and other state and city leaders were silent for much of the previous evening, leading to widespread criticism that they weren’t doing enough to respond to the fires and destruction happening across the city. President Donald Trump weighed in, criticizing the city for a “total lack of leadership and saying he would send in the federal troops to “get the job done right.” Walz called Trump’s remarks, including a tweet that referred to shooting looters, as “unhelpful.” Minnesota House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, raised concerns about the coming weekend. “There has been a disturbing lack of leadership and clear plan on how we’re going to prevent further chaos with the weekend approaching,” he said in a statement. “City and state leaders knew that there would be more looting and riots last night, but took no visible steps to prevent the destruction.” Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan said “Minneapolis is in a state of disorder.” “It’s traumatizing and scary and sad and depressing and devastating,” she said. “Our leaders @GovTimWalz and Mayor Frey have disappeared. How long will it take to undo this damage?” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a news conference shortly after 1 a.m. and said the decision to evacuate the 3rd Police Precinct in Minneapolis was his to protect the lives of officers and protesters. “This is one of the most difficult situations that our city has been through,” he said. “I’m not going to stand up here to tell you that there are easy answers to it.” Democratic leaders in the Legislature, however, expressed frustration about a news conference called Thursday afternoon by U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, where they promised a “robust” investigation but did not announce any charges. “The county attorney needs to file charges and the officers must be arrested as soon as possible, House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler tweeted. “The case must be won, and legal standards met in order to get a conviction, but we need to have a clear statement that a murder trial is coming. Now.” State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington called Floyd’s death at the hands of police a “murder” during a morning press conference with the governor. “That’s what it looked like to me.”",0.0

Like many other citizens of this country who reject the racism and bigotry that accompanies our news cycle each day. Minneapolis resident George Floyd, 46, is the latest in a long line of black men to have their lives unjustifiably taken by police officers, and caught on camera. However, this time there are no compromised camera angles or ways to explain away what really happened. A police officer jammed a knee into his neck for more than six minutes while Floyd was handcuffed on the ground complaining about not being able to breathe. Before he died. Hence, Kaepernick is urging the oppressed to “fight back” via Twitter: When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction.  The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.  We have the right to fight back!  Rest in Power George Floyd — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) May 28, 2020 Peaceful protests in Minneapolis turned violent on Wednesday as the back-and-forth between angry citizens and the police department ramped up due to Floyd’s senseless death. Kaepernick isn’t evoking violence, here, but a response to violence. He’s not advocating the looting or destruction of community. He’s expressing the need for the oppressed to defend themselves, including during protests, in these strange times. Because, depending on the human decency and integrity of those put in place to protect citizens, has proven a losing battle for some. Kaepernick became one of the world’s most polarizing athletes during the preseason of 2016 after taking a knee in protest of the social injustice in America, while a member of the San Francisco 49ers. He’d go on to lose his job and be blackballed from the NFL following his display, which he developed with a former soldier, who felt taking a knee in peaceful protest to be more respectful than sitting on the bench. However, Kaepernick’s critics didn’t see it that way, and neither did many NFL owners and officials, who have attempted to silence him since that time. Although meant as a display against the social injustice many Americans experience in this country, taking a knee was touted as an insult to the military by those made to feel uncomfortable by the display. Kaepernick also settled a collusion suit against the NFL for being blackballed, and received a deal from Nike following his stance, to the dismay of those who oppose his views. Ironically, Nike sales soared after its endorsement of Kaepernick and his social stance. However, the world continues to turn, perpetuating the same tactics Kaepernick took a knee in peaceful protest against four years ago. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired for their involvement in Floyd’s death, but none have been charged. Please subscribe now and support the local journalism YOU rely on and trust.

The protest, organized by the People’s Organization for Progress, started as a rally in front of the Lincoln statue near the city’s historic courthouse, with demonstrators loudly chanting “George Floyd,” “I can’t breathe,” “Power to the people” and calls for justice for Floyd. “Arrest them all! Arrest them all!” the crowd chanted, referring to the four Minneapolis police officers who were seen on video during the apprehension of Floyd. The protest remained peaceful as demonstrators began to march down Market Street and onto Broad Street, with hundreds of additional people joining the original group of marchers. Most walked on the hot pavement past Newark City Hall and then headed back to Market Street, where they gathered again near the statue of a seated Abraham Lincoln at about 2:30 p.m. and chanted, “Black lives matter.” Police presence was light, with just a few police cruisers blocking streets to keep vehicles away from the demonstrators, many carrying signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” and “Black Lives Matter.” Other signs were critical of cops and some railed against white supremacy. The orderly demonstration in Newark was in sharp contrast to the violent protests, riots and looting that broke out in other cities across the nation during the past two nights. Protesters in other cities clashed with police, set fire to police cars and other vehicles, and torched businesses. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. Floyd, who was not armed and did not appear to be resisting arrest, was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Four police officers who were at the scene have been fired, and Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. Prior to the demonstration in Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka called Floyd’s death outright murder, and demanded that all the officers involved be arrested. “He was killed on purpose and murdered on purpose,” Baraka said. The People’s Organization for Progress was formed to help eradicate racism and take on relevant social issues.

In some cities, office windows were smashed, police cars and other vehicles were set on fire and bottles were thrown at police officers trying to keep a lid on the protests and violence in the streets. In Minneapolis, thousands of protesters ignored a curfew and vows of a forceful police response to take to the city’s streets for a fourth straight night, and some public officials acknowledged they didn’t have enough manpower to control the large crowds. Early Saturday, the Pentagon ordered the U.S. Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities across the nation. A man was shot dead in Detroit, police cars and office windows were battered in Atlanta, and demonstrators had skirmishes with police in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Friday night turned out to be another chaotic night in Minneapolis, where police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. People stand on a burned up car as fires burn near a Target store after a night of unrest and protests in the death of George Floyd early Thursday, May 28, in downtown Minneapolis. Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day.AP The new round of unrest came despite Gov. Tim Walz vowing early in the day to show a more forceful response by the state than the one Thursday run by Minneapolis city leaders. But by early Saturday morning, Walz was acknowledging he didn’t have enough manpower, even with some 500 National Guard soldiers. ""We do not have the numbers,"" Walz said. ""We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground."" Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Walz to accept any help. ""You need more resources,"" the group said in a tweet. ""Law enforcement needs leadership."" Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. ""Prosecute the police!"" some chanted, and ""Say his name: George Floyd!"" Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn't surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. ""I'm outraged,"" he said of the Floyd case. ""But I'm also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It's been swelling for years."" Chauvin was also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities ""felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator."" Denver police fire canisters to disperse a protest outside the State Capitol over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed man in police custody in Minneapolis.AP OTHER PROTESTS ACROSS THE NATION Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Portland, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. ""You are disgracing our city,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, ""No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was ""worried about excited delirium or whatever."" An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press.

People’s Organization for Progress organized a protest for 1 p.m. Saturday near the Veterans Courthouse in Newark. Protesters will be calling for police reforms after Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes while handcuffed. “People’s Organization for Progress has been having protests in our city for decades without incident, without issue all the time,” Baraka said on the steps of Newark City Hall hours before the protest was set to start. ""They’ve been very consistent in fighting against the injustices that have been happening in our country.” Newark has a history of racial tensions. The Newark riots in 1967 began after two white officers beat John Smith, a black cab driver, and rumors spread that he had died. The five days of unrest changed the course of the city’s history. The mayor said he will be attending today’s protest, called Floyd’s death outright murder, and demanded that all the officers involved should be arrested. One officer, Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. “He was killed on purpose and murdered on purpose,” Baraka said. People’s Organization for Progress Chairman Lawrence Hamm, who is also challenging Cory Booker for his U.S. Senate seat, noted the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 12 is fighting the creation of the city’s civilian complaint review board in court. The board would have the ability to investigate claims of police misconduct separately from internal affairs. “That case right now is being decided by the justices of the supreme court and I hope that those justices are watching what is going on in America today,” Hamm said as he joined Baraka at City Hall. “I hope that those justices are watching what is going on in America today.” A Newark police officer earlier this month was put on desk duty after video surfaced of him punching a black man in the face. Another Newark cop was indicted after he repeatedly shot at moving vehicle last year during a pursuit and killed a man in the car. The city’s police department is under federal review after the U.S. Department of Justice found a pattern of unconstitutional practices. The city agreed to a list of police reforms known as a consent decree. Rebecca Panico may be reached at rpanico@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @BeccaPanico.",0.0

Avi Wolfman-Arent said he identified himself to police as a journalist covering the demonstration, but was detained anyway and issued a code violation notice for failure to disperse. Wolfman-Arent said he was not hurt and none of the estimated 50 to 75 protesters he was near appeared to suffer serious injuries, despite some skirmishes with police during a roughly half-mile walk from the police headquarters down 6th Street. “There was verbal abuse going both ways, for sure,” and at one point early in the protest some people hurled water bottles at the police, Wolfman-Arent said. “There was a lot of anger. Just a lot, a lot of anger.” Just a little context to add to this video since I see ppl repeating one detail…I believe I was taken to the ground from behind or the side.

Many also had police bicycles, which they sometimes thrusted at protesters who weren’t moving or confronted the officers verbally. “One guy I remember distinctly was yelling ‘Faggot! Faggot! Faggot!’ at the police,” he said. The protest was organized by local activist Asa Khalif, who started the event shortly after 4 p.m. by using a megaphone to speak to the few dozen officers standing outside police headquarters. “We’re gonna take any motherf–kin’ street we want tonight,” Khalif said during a speech mentioning the city’s Frank Rizzo statue, the 1985 MOVE bombing and the team of attorneys promising to represent arrested protesters for free.

The group of largely young, white protesters began marching around 4:30 p.m., first heading east on Race Street and then south on 6th Street. “The general flow of the protesters was away from the police,” Wolfman-Arent said. “I didn’t see anyone charging the police.” The first clash, however, came around Arch Street, when a protester was tackled and sprayed with what Wolfman-Arent described as a “ruddy, orange-red substance.” Young woman was just lying on the ground.

That’s where Wolfman-Arent was arrested and handcuffed while face down on the ground in front of The Curtis Publishing Company building. “They claim at some point a dispersal warning was given,” he said of police. “I did not hear a dispersal warning. … In fairness, I was wearing my headphones, so it’s possible that that noise was muffled for me.” Kimberly Paynter, a WHYY photojournalist also on the scene, but who was not arrested, said she did not hear a dispersal warning either. She said she did not see Wolfman-Arent get arrested. Wolfman-Arent was transported to a police station at 17th Street and Montgomery Ave., near Temple University, with seven other protesters. He said the face-covering he was wearing was removed by police ahead of the ride. For all but one of those seven, it was their first time being arrested at a protest, Wolfman-Arent learned. “I thought, you know, maybe the people who go to these smaller protests, maybe they’re the people who are the hard-core ones,” he said. “But by their telling, they weren’t.” Wolfman-Arent said the recorder and boom microphone he was carrying during the protest were confiscated by police, but returned following his release.

After a march in honor of George Floyd wrapped up Sunday evening, bystanders captured some of the violence, largely along State Street. Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer — since charged with his murder — set off protests nationwide, outraged at the more than eight minutes the unarmed black man remained pinned down despite being handcuffed and saying he couldn't breathe. In several major cities, including nearby Philadelphia, protests have turned violent and been accompanied by widespread looting and vandalism. Note: Videos included in this post from social media may include profanity and violent material. At a news conference late Sunday night, Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said that there were no reported injuries, but attempted looting involved a Snipes store, Tony's Liquor store and a Dollar Store. A bank's window had been broken. After extending condolences to Floyd's family, Trenton Police Chief Sheilah Coley apologized for the ""shameful, the disrespectful way that the city where I am employed has decided to honor Floyd's memory."" As dusk gave way to night, vandalism began, with windows being smashed at a Bank of America on East State Street, seen in Facebook footage shared by Crystal Feliciano. Another witness, Maurice Lennon, a Trenton resident, also captured the activity in his own Facebook live stream. Lennon's footage appeared to show a crowd breaking into a nearby Snipes sneaker store, which was robbed of merchandise by multiple people. Separate video posted by NorthJersey.com appeared to show a crowd attacking two parked Trenton Police SUVs, breaking the vehicles' windows and then setting fire to both. The same video showed members of the state Department of Corrections Special Operations Group, which was sent to assist with the response in Trenton, according to State Policeman’s Benevolent Association Local 105 Executive Vice President William Sullivan. ""That was a disaster waiting to happen,"" Lennon said at one point in his live stream, saying that after the protest had ended there was still a crowd of people milling around downtown. By 9 p.m., NJ Transit bus service for downtown Trenton was suspended through Monday at 6 a.m., due to police activity, while the mayor's office enacted an overnight curfew until 8 a.m. ""We cannot have our city destroyed. We cannot function under burning buildings and looting,"" Trenton Council President Kathy McBride said at the same press conference where Gusciora and other officials spoke. McBride urged residents to make sure their children remained at home safe, while also adding ""for all of you outsiders that have come into Trenton - we will not tolerate the nonsense from any of you."" ""Tonight I see people setting things on fire, looting businesses — when there's already so few businesses left in this city,"" Coley said. She continued: ""How dare you break in and loot and burn and steal?"" ""So those new Nikes are going to make you feel better? You breaking into the pharmacy is going to make you feel better?"" Coley said. She said that the violence did not have to happen, as it broke out after ""five solid hours"" of a peaceful protest. NJ.com noted Sunday night police had joined protestors in taking a knee in solidarity. ""People have the right to protest. They have the right. We acknowledge that. We embrace that,"" Coley said. She continued, ""But then the cowards of it all, under the cloak of darkness decided that this was what they were going to do."" ""This has nothing to do with the conversation about police and justice. By creating more damage to our downtown business only hurts our city moving forward,"" Gusciora said. Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo Onofri also condemned the violence as detracting from the weight of the day's earlier, peaceful activity as a way of honoring Floyd's memory. All New Jersey county prosecutors offices released a collective statement this weekend, condemning Floyd's killing. ""Trenton was the birthplace of a revolution, and here we can make that change again,"" Onofri said, ""but it doesn't start by rooting a family dollar and burning buildings. "" As a private citizen, Lennon agreed. ""I'm not gonna lie, I get the anger, I understand the anger,"" Lennon said in an interview with New Jersey 101.5 News. He continued: ""You have to practice self discipline and know when things start to lose sight of what the real agenda is."" Lennon was hoping to help lead community cleanup efforts, once the overnight curfew was lifted Monday morning. Until Sunday night, most protests in New Jersey this weekend remained peaceful, with Newark's mayor and Camden's police chief joining marchers in solidarity. But Sunday also saw unrest in Atlantic City, police there said. ""Unfortunately, the peaceful protest that took place earlier by many has transitioned to criminal activity now taking place by a few. If you can, avoid Atlantic City at this time,"" Atlantic City Police shared on Twitter around 6:30 p.m. A curfew was put in place and a state-of-emergency order issued. In Philadelphia, extensive vandalism and looting continued into a second night, and the National Guard was called in to help protect city landmarks. More from New Jersey 101.5:",0.0

The officer who put the knee on his neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin and three other officers were also fired from the department. Since videos of the incident were released, protests and riots have occurred across the country, including throughout New Jersey and in New York City and Philadelphia.

The group continued on toward the boardwalk and the Tropicana before coming back to the public safety building — about a two-hour march. Protestors lingered outside after. The demonstration in Atlantic City, like in other New Jersey communities, was peaceful. At one point, an Atlantic City police officer kneeled with the protestors. “Today is a good step in the right direction,” said Troy Oglesby, one of the protestors. “This is where people got a chance to voice their opinion about the atrocity that happened to George Floyd.

USA TODAY What's going on? As protests over the death of George Floyd gripped many American big cities over the weekend, Parliament Funkadelic music legend George Clinton delivered a pointed reminder of what unity looks like. It's a short video of two, 2-year old boys, one black and one white, joyously greeting each other on a New York Street while Marvin Gaye's early '70s classic ""What's Going On"" plays. George Clinton (Photo: William Thoren) Clinton included Gaye's lyrics and a quote from the late Nelson Mandela in the post.

""We must work to make ourselves better, and help (each) other be better as well. Spread kindness, stop hate."" A video of the attempted arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 went viral on Tuesday, May 26. In it, Floyd, who is black, repeatedly says he can’t breathe as a white police officer kneels on his neck. Floyd died soon after. The four officers involved in the incident have been fired and one has been charged with third degree murder. Protests erupted in Minneapolis the evening of May 26 and have since spread to multiple cities across the country and in front of the White House. As for the post, Clinton, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and former Plainfield barber, could have easily added an appropriate P-Funk song to the message: ""One Nation Under a Groove.""

In the days since, American cities have erupted in protest and violence over yet another instance of violence perpetrated against an African American civilian, which in turn has been met by more police violence against demonstrators — a cycle which has become all too familiar in America. The protests are reminiscent of those that erupted in 2014 over the death of another African American man at the hands of a white police officer, Michael Brown. Of course, this is happening all while the President of the United States douses an already combustible situation with demagoguery and racism, a ghastly yet unsurprising dereliction of leadership.

(Fibonacci Blue/Flickr) The generally peaceful protests that have greeted cities during the day have been met by violence and looting at night, with one notable exception. On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Newark — a city still visible with scars from the 1967 Newark Riot — and demonstrated peacefully under the leadership of Mayor Ras Baraka and Larry Hamm who heads the People’s Organization for Progress, a progressive grassroots political association. The demonstration remained largely peaceful throughout the four hours that it lasted and police (notably absent of riot gear and non-lethal weaponry) allowed protesters to share their voices, stories and collective pain unimpeded. Sadly, this has not been the case everywhere, and now more than ever it has become important for the denizens of this country, which has systematically failed its black, brown and indigenous communities for centuries, to rise up and speak out passionately and angrily about the unabashed racial violence perpetrated on these communities daily by police and others. Despite the fact that protests against this very evil were taking place as little as a few miles away from Seton Hall’s main campus in South Orange and blocks away from its law school, and despite the fact that the University promotes a “45% diversity rate” among its student body, Seton Hall put out a disappointingly underwhelming statement on Saturday on the unrest and violence currently sweeping the country. “As a Catholic community of faith committed to diversity and inclusion, we reaffirm our conviction that racism has no place — anywhere,” the statement read. “Our Church proclaims that human life is sacred and that the dignity of the human person is the foundation of a moral vision for society.” The statement is made even more troubling by the fact that it was only two years ago that Seton Hall was embroiled in its own protest for several days as student activists from the Concerned 44 group occupied the lobby of President’s Hall in an unprecedented attempt to demand greater attention from the University on issues of racial inequity. Though the University’s statement was underwhelming, just as eye catching has been the silence from Seton Hall’s Student Government Association, an organization that exists solely to represent the student body. In fairness, classes are not in session right now and members are likely scattered across the nation, but if anything has been learned from the coronavirus pandemic it is how to communicate from a distance — a feat that the SGA showcased by holding a remote forum via Microsoft Teams in April. It is the job of these two organizations, in particular, to make students feel not just welcome at this University, but heard. To make them feel like valued members of our shared community, something Mayor Baraka and Larry Hamm did at Saturday’s protest in Newark, a protest that should serve as a model for catharsis, healing and social activism in the wake of Floyd’s death. Yet, we have seen no such leadership on this front at Seton Hall. No messages of comfort. No meaningful condemnation of racism or racial violence, even as American cities like New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Atlanta and Los Angeles burn before our eyes in fires fueled by anger and injustice. Injustices that have been nary acknowledged, let alone corrected, by white society. Not even as we watch on live television the brutalization of demonstrators — some of whom might even be fellow Pirates — protesting peacefully in the streets while police and National Guardsmen in riot gear march in lockstep, dispersing crowds as cities nationwide hand new curfew orders down. The only way this country can begin to heal is for leaders to address the racial strife that exists within this country head on and at all levels. Political leaders, business leaders and cultural leaders all must rise up in condemnation against not just the officer who killed Floyd, but against the system of policing that exists in the United States that has allowed thousands of others like Floyd to be killed in encounters with the police. To rise up against a system that has Black men and women fearing for their lives every time a cop pulls up behind them on the road. To rise up against a system that has promoted a racially inequitable society on various fronts. As the popular protest phrase goes, “white silence is violence.” But it is no longer enough to simply denounce the problem — instead, Seton Hall and the SGA must address how they plan to be a part of the solution.

The statement, which was posted on Instagram, comes six days after the death of Floyd and approximately two hours after an editorial in The Setonian called on the SGA to address the unrest currently sweeping the nation. “We stand by our students and we will not tolerate these instances of police brutality,” the executive committee said in the statement. The committee plans to push the University to “release a statement on systemic oppression and take actions beyond the statement.” “We stand by our students and we will not tolerate these instances of police brutality,” the executive committee said in the statement.

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Seattle, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, as activists call for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, westbound on Interstate Highway 35. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. “It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn’t appear to drive through any barricades,” the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. “He was driving a gas tanker,” said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. “He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful.” State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation’s capital Protests continued in Washington, D.C., with marches from a historically black university to a park just across from the White House. The peaceful marchers had a city police escort as they walked the nearly 2 miles from Howard University to Lafayette Square. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. “Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,” read one sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. “It’s crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,” she said. “We are at a point where it’s the same story, the same things are happening. I’m tired of this.” The demonstration in Lafayette Park turned violent during the night, as protesters threw bottles at police, set fires to cars and to the basement of St. John’s Church. The historic church has been attended by every president since James Madison. Police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser had established a citywide curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. ‘Day of Reflection’ declared in Louisville for Monday Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer is calling for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He plans to hold a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. Early Monday, police and National Guard reportedly shot and killed a man while trying to disperse a crowd outside of a food market in downtown Louisville, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. Law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At an evening press conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were “hijacking” their efforts. Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers’ firing on Sunday, saying the footage “was disturbing on many levels.” “We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,” Bottoms said. “But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.” Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter’s body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as they were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver’s seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver’s side window. Police then use a taser on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. GPB said Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to the Spelman College Student Government Association. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also used a taser against her. ‘They haven’t heard us’: Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday, following a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. “We tried kneeling,” protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR’s Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. “We tried putting on those T-shirts that said I can’t breathe, we tried those hashtags, we tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven’t heard us, they haven’t done nothing.” “The violence, for him, is justified,” Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., shot in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was shot in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. “I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,” Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. “I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.” I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

After a march in honor of George Floyd wrapped up Sunday evening, bystanders captured some of the violence, largely along State Street. Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer — since charged with his murder — set of protests nationwide, outraged at the more than eight minutes the unarmed black man remained pinned down despite being handcuffed and saying he couldn't breathe. In several major cities, including nearby Philadelphia, protests have turned violent and been accompanied by widespread looting and vandalism. Note: Videos included in this post from social media may include profanity and violent material. At a news conference late Sunday night, Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said that there were no reported injuries, but attempted looting involved a Snipes store, Tony's Liquor store and a Dollar Store. A bank's window had been broken. After extending condolences to Floyd's family, Trenton Police Chief Sheilah Coley apologized for the ""shameful, the disrespectful way that the city where I am employed has decided to honor Floyd's memory."" As dusk gave way to night, vandalism began, with windows being smashed at a Bank of America on East State Street, seen in Facebook footage shared by Crystal Feliciano. Another witness, Maurice Lennon, a Trenton resident, also captured the activity in his own Facebook live stream. Lennon's footage appeared to show a crowd breaking into a nearby Snipes sneaker store, which was robbed of merchandise by multiple people. Separate video posted by NorthJersey.com appeared to show a crowd attacking two parked Trenton Police SUVs, breaking the vehicles' windows and then setting fire to both. ""That was a disaster waiting to happen,"" Lennon said at one point in his live stream, saying that after the protest had ended there was still a crowd of people milling around downtown. By 9 p.m., NJ Transit bus service for downtown Trenton was suspended through Monday at 6 a.m., due to police activity, while the mayor's office enacted an overnight curfew until 8 a.m. ""We cannot have our city destroyed. We cannot function under burning buildings and looting,"" Trenton Council President Kathy McBride said at the same press conference where Gusciora and other officials spoke. McBride urged residents to make sure their children remained at home safe, while also adding ""for all of you outsiders that have come into Trenton - we will not tolerate the nonsense from any of you."" ""Tonight I see people setting things on fire, looting businesses — when there's already so few businesses left in this city,"" Coley said. She continued: ""How dare you break in and loot and burn and steal?"" ""So those new Nikes are going to make you feel better? You breaking into the pharmacy is going to make you feel better?"" Coley said. She said that the violence did not have to happen, as it broke out after ""five solid hours"" of a peaceful protest. NJ.com noted Sunday night police had joined protestors in taking a knee in solidarity. ""People have the right to protest. They have the right. We acknowledge that. We embrace that,"" Coley said. She continued, ""But then the cowards of it all, under the cloak of darkness decided that this was what they were going to do."" ""This has nothing to do with the conversation about police and justice. By creating more damage to our downtown business only hurts our city moving forward,"" Gusciora said. Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo Onofri also condemned the violence as detracting from the weight of the day's earlier, peaceful activity as a way of honoring Floyd's memory. All New Jersey county prosecutors offices released a collective statement this weekend, condemning Floyd's killing. ""Trenton was the birthplace of a revolution, and here we can make that change again,"" Onofri said, ""but it doesn't start by rooting a family dollar and burning buildings. "" As a private citizen, Lennon agreed. ""I'm not gonna lie, I get the anger, I understand the anger,"" Lennon said in an interview with New Jersey 101.5 News. He continued: ""You have to practice self discipline and know when things start to lose sight of what the real agenda is."" Lennon was hoping to help lead community cleanup efforts, once the overnight curfew was lifted Monday morning. Until Sunday night, most protests in New Jersey this weekend remained peaceful, with Newark's mayor and Camden's police chief joining marchers in solidarity. But Sunday also saw unrest in Atlantic City, police there said. ""Unfortunately, the peaceful protest that took place earlier by many has transitioned to criminal activity now taking place by a few. If you can, avoid Atlantic City at this time,"" Atlantic City Police shared on Twitter around 6:30 p.m. A curfew was put in place and a state-of-emergency order issued. In Philadelphia, extensive vandalism and looting continued into a second night, and the National Guard was called in to help protect city landmarks. More from WOBM News:",0.0

It was the second time in a week that Biden left his home, following a brief Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at a veterans memorial in New Castle, Del. Biden has been campaigning exclusively from his house since coronavirus lockdowns began, repeatedly saying he is following stay-at-home orders issued by Delaware’s governor. We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night’s protests in Wilmington. pic.twitter.com/0h2ApbKT0C — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 As cities across the country have been overwhelmed by sometimes violent protests responding to Floyd’s death, and as President Trump has stoked divisions with tweets about “vicious dogs” ready to respond to White House protests, labeling of Minnesota protesters as “thugs,” and repeated blaming of unrest on Democratic mayors and governors, Biden has tried to increase his visibility to portray a more empathetic and conciliatory approach to leadership. “We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,” Biden wrote on Twitter and Facebook, alongside a picture of him on one knee, wearing a mask, speaking to an African American man holding a child. “We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.” “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden’s post continued. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night’s protests in Wilmington.” Biden’s campaign posted a picture of the visit on social media, but provided no additional information about how long Biden stayed at the protest site, how many people he talked to, or when on Sunday he made the visit, which was not announced beforehand. While Biden and his campaign had purposely taken a low-visibility approach to the early days of the coronavirus crisis, preferring instead to keep the focus on President Trump and the daily press briefings credited with eroding the president’s approval ratings, Biden has been much more responsive to Floyd’s death and its aftermath, which have triggered a level of national protest not seen since the late 1960s. Biden delivered a five-minute speech from his Wilmington home Friday, framing Floyd’s death as the latest example of a centuries-old “open wound” of racism in the United States. Floyd’s death, Biden said, was “an act of brutality so elemental it did more than deny one black man in America his civil rights and human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life.” Earlier Friday, Biden spoke to Floyd’s family on the phone. Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, told MSNBC on Saturday that during the call, “I asked him could he please, please get justice for my brother.” A later call from President Trump, Floyd said, was much briefer. “I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off,” Floyd said.",0.0

Sunday, June 30, 2019 NorthJersey There's no stopping the spirit of Pride. The global coronavirus pandemic has changed every aspect of life, and the resulting cessation of public gatherings means June's commemoration of Pride Month will be decidedly different. Organizations across the region are getting creative, hosting celebrations, gatherings and shows as the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community perseveres during a trying time, facing an uncertain future. This summer's now-canceled NYC Pride schedule of in-person events was originally planned for June 14 to 28 by organization Heritage of Pride. The Pride March moves north on 7th Ave. Sunday June 30, 2019 (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) “While this pandemic prevents us from coming together to march, it will in no way stop us from celebrating the indelible contributions that the LGBTIA+ community has made to New York City or from recommitting ourselves to the fight for equal rights,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an April statement. It's been half a century since the modern LGBTQ rights movement was born with the Gay Pride March presented by the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee in June 1970. That landmark march came a year after the historic uprising at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, when on June 28, 1969, a riot broke out as New York City police raided the bar, enforcing a law against selling alcohol to homosexual patrons. It should have been a banner year. Instead, like everything else during the pandemic, events have had to be rethought. Here are some of the inventive ways. 'Enormous virtual hug' The New Jersey LGBTQ Pride Parade, Rally and Festival, an Asbury Park fixture since 1992 historically held on the first Sunday in June was moved by event organizers Jersey Pride, Inc. from June 7 to National Coming Out Day, Sunday, Oct. 11. NJ HISTORY: How the LGBTQ community saved Asbury Park That delay isn't stopping Paradise, a hub of gay nightlife in Asbury Park, from planning to celebrate online. Paradise will present a Virtual Pride Zoom Party 5 to 9 p.m. Sunday, June 7. Created by DJs Steven Jay and Steve Sidewalk, the night will feature music from Jay and Sidewalk and fellow DJs Tyler Valentine and Mikey Mo, as well as drag performances. ""For some people (Paradise) is just like their safe haven, seeing everybody, making those kinds of connections with people and having that availability,"" said Jay, also assistant manager at the club. ""Maybe there’s somebody you’ve missed that you haven’t exchanged numbers with that will be there (at the Zoom party), maybe there’s someone that you’ve been worried about or you just want to see people, see their face, see that they’re OK.

""We were very, very connected and now we’re all feeling that loss and a lot of people are feeling that loss and they’re home alone in their apartments,"" said Paradise event coordinator Kelly J. Martin. So it is really important for us to be able to see each other and attend something together, even if it is only virtual. What they really, really need right now is a huge, enormous virtual hug.” Jersey Pride and Asbury Park-based organization Garden State Equality will present United in Pride noon Sunday, June 7 via Facebook Live and YouTube. Sponsored by Bank of America, the virtual celebration will feature entertainment from artists including La Bouche and Felipe Rose of the Village People, and United in Pride will also raise funds for organizations working for racial justice in New Jersey, according to the event's website.

Keep the momentum going A pair of New Jersey towns that held their inaugural Pride celebrations in 2019, Toms River and Princeton, are likewise finding ways to keep the momentum going. Exit 82 Theatre Company, which launched Toms River Pride last year, reconfigured its June 20 celebration with social distancing guidelines. Saturday morning will feature a ""Drive-Through Pride"" with a closed path so attendees can participate from their own cars, followed in the afternoon and evening by online events including make-up demonstrations, drag performances and presentations by Garden State Equality. ""This is something we wanted to do because in Toms River and Ocean County, the tradition stands stronger than the party,"" said Billy Cardone, executive director of Exit 82 Theatre Company. ""We cared more about the visibility of our community so people are reminded that they are not alone.""

Phil Murphy and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy, according to Rustin Center chief activist Robt Seda-Schreiber. With the possibility of an in-person gathering out of the question this June, the Rustin Center pivoted to Virtual Pride '20, an online parade happening 7 to 10 p.m. on Saturday, June 20. Virtual Pride '20 is expanding on online community gatherings nightly through Rustin Center's Social Justice Power Hours on its Facebook page. “We want to dedicate ourselves to always being true to our local community but also with our eyes on that national outreach where we can really bring together folks in this unique opportunity,"" Seda-Schreiber said.

Their North Jersey Pride Festival is usually held the second Sunday in June at Memorial Park in Maplewood with a PG-rated, family orientation. Last year’s festival drew upwards of 5,000. “We’re designed with families in mind,” said executive director C.J. Prince. Obviously, they’re facing a bit of a challenge, in this socially-distanced year. North Jersey Pride serves the entire northern part of the state. The events draw people from even beyond New Jersey. Somehow, on some platform, the show will go on, Prince promised. “We definitely didn’t want to let June go by without marking it,” Prince said. “People really need something to look forward to and celebrate. Our theme this year is, ‘Resilient and Proud.’"" CJ Prince, Executive Director of North Jersey Pride, stands near rainbow painted crosswalks in Maplewood on Tuesday, June 19, 2018.

Among them: a virtual raising of the rainbow flag, with appropriate speeches and commentary, on Sunday, June 7; a “make your own pride banner” event in which community kids and adults make signs to be displayed outside of homes which locals can then see from their cars or on foot.; Instagram live segments boosting local LGBTQ-owned businesses, and a big June 28 virtual event featuring celebrities, music, performances and videos of North Jerseyans celebrating Pride in their homes.

Fighting bullying with Pride Beyond Pride Month, Southern New Jersey Gay Pride’s 12th annual festival in at Cooper River Park in Cherry Hill is planned for noon to 6 p.m. Sept. 13 but it’s unclear if that date will change due to the current pandemic. The celebration’s theme is #YouAreIncluded in collaboration with WorldPride. This is the fifth year of an anti-bullying program. The free, rain-or-shine event includes vendors, live performances and dancing. Participants are asked to bring their own blankets, chairs and tables. Southern New Jersey Gay Pride director and founder DeAnn Cox said they’re also looking at options for a virtual Pride celebration and will see how other festivals unfold virtually in June. Philadelphia-based LGBTQ+ film festival qFLIX Philadelphia, originally scheduled to launch March 22, was also postponed and has switched gears to launch PrideFLIX, an online iteration of the festival launching Monday, June 1, with a portion of ticket proceeds supporting local LGBTQ+ charities. While the Philly Pride Parade and Festival originally scheduled for June 14 has been canceled, the day's planned Philly Pride Run 5K race has been reconfigured as a virtual run. Registered participants pick their own start time, location and course and will have from 10 a.m. Sunday, June 14 to 10 a.m. Sunday, June 21 to complete the race supporting the William Way LGBT Community Center. CLOSE See Gov. Phil Murphy and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker speak at Jersey Pride, Asbury Park's 27th annual celebration of the LGBTQ community. Asbury Park Press 'We’re a particularly resilient bunch' The LGBTQ Prom has been held by the Hudson Pride Center in New Jersey's Hudson County for more than 10 years. This year’s online edition will allow young folks, age 15 to 22, to significantly expand their dating pool. You can hook up with a hot guy in Melbourne or a sexy lady in Mumbai and bring them — virtually — to the prom. “We believe every kid should be able to have a prom and go with their date of their choice, in the attire of their choice,” said Elizabeth Schedl, chief operations officer for Hudson Pride Center. The event, which will feature a DJ, vogue competition, and the crowning of “royals” (king and queen is too cisgender) is from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. June 13. The Hudson County group, based in Jersey City, will be hosting many other Pride events, including a SAGE LGBTQ yoga event (for 55 and older) 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. June 3 on Zoom, a live happy hour from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. June 11 in which folks 21 and up can learn to make cocktails, Pride yoga events on June 16 and 22 (6 p.m. to 7 p.m.), an open mike night on June 18 (6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., ages 18 and up), a queer book reading on June 25 at 11 a.m., and a Pride watch party on June 28. “Our main focus is really to make sure to connect with individuals and celebrate our pride — especially the most isolated individuals,” Schedl said. “I think there’s a sense of loss, in that the community won’t be able to be together and celebrate,” said Rick Kavin, vice-president of operations for The Pride Center of New Jersey. “But at the same time I think we’re a particularly resilient bunch.” More than 65,000 people participated in Rochester, New York's Pride parade and festival last year. Organizers hope to reschedule the week-long series of events sometime this fall, depending on how the state's re-opening plans proceed.

At 7 p.m. Monday, June 8, the page will premiere a virtual parade of sorts in the form of a video featuring contributions from local organizations and community members. In Delaware, there will be no annual Pride Festival and Parade this year. It would have been the second parade for Delaware Pride Inc., which has been run by a small group of volunteers since the late '90s. Because the organization is run by only a handful of people, it does not have the capability to host something virtually, explained Vice President Amanda White. Madeline Porter of Wilmington displays a rainbow flag during Delaware Pride Festival in Dover on June 1, 2019 (Photo: Jeanne Kuang/The News Journal) The group also is looking into virtual events for June and beyond. The festival and parade have been rescheduled for Saturday, June 5, 2021. The event is free to the public. Fay Jacobs, who is the editor of Letters from Camp Rehoboth, a non-profit community service organization and publication, said efforts to connect the community have gone virtual. The group will celebrate Pride Month with the June 15 issue of Letters, Jacobs said. “At this point, everyone is worried about a couple of things,” the local author said. “They’re worried about the upcoming election. They’re worried about the pandemic. A lot of people are home and paying attention more than ever to the news and, personally, I hope to see Pride celebrations on the network news, on the cable channels. I don’t know if we will. I’m certainly very hopeful we will.” On Tuesday, May 26, Delaware Governor John Carney lifted more social restrictions in the First State, announcing that gatherings of up to 250 people will be allowed starting June 1. Whether that will change plans for Pride Month celebrations is yet to be determined. White said because Delaware Pride does not have a membership count, it may be hard to hold in-person events even with the relaxing of restrictions because it would be difficult to figure out how many people might show up. 'Stay home, stay connected' Baltimore Pride, in its 45th year and one of the oldest pride events in the nation, has been postponed and has not yet announced a new date for its celebration. The festival is usually three days long and draws around 30,000 people. When it does occur, the celebration is slated to include a drag show, high heel race, pet parade and more. The Frederick Pride Parade in Frederick, Maryland, is rescheduled for Sunday, Oct.4. Now in its ninth year, the event is part of an all-day festival at Carroll Creek Linear Park. Elsewhere in Maryland, The Cumberland Pride Festival in Allegany County will be two weeks later on Sunday, Oct. 18. And the Westminster Pride Extravaganza in the Baltimore suburb of Westminster, is postponed with a new date not yet determined. According to howardcountypride.org, Howard County Pride organizers are postponing HoCO Pride 2020 “to continue taking protective measures against the spread of the virus.” Meanwhile, the group plans to celebrate pride in other ways in Howard County mainly through interactive online activities. Annapolis Pride is going virtual with its parade on Saturday, June 27 at 4 p.m. As Annapolispride.org says, “The parade and festival have been cancelled, but Pride is not!” The webpage offers a virtual festival with links to businesses, spiritual groups, community organizations and other resources. The Hagerstown, Maryland, Pride Parade also will take place virtually. Hagerstown Hopes released a letter online at hagerstownhopes.org: “Please remember that ours is a community of survivors,” it says. “While this news may feel like a setback ...we see it as a way to become more creative and as an opportunity to plan an extra-special Pride Festival in 2021.” Alicia Notarriani, The Herald-Mail, contributed to this report.

In a statement he released late Sunday night on behalf of the Monmouth County law enforcement community, Gramiccioni said, “We expect that the officers involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law as the video capturing his death is indefensible."" The statement, joined by Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden and Middletown Police Chief Craig Weber, president of the Monmouth County Police Chiefs Association, began with three words: “I can’t breathe."" Those were the final words spoken by 46-year-old Floyd last week as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. “The words of George Floyd’s unheeded pleas for help with a police officer’s knee on his neck and his subsequent death are seared into the consciousness of the world,"" Gramiccioni’s statement said.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday.

Floyd's death sparked violent protests and unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul that spread nationwide and led to a lockdown of the White House on Friday. The four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest have been fired. Officer Derek Chauvin, a white officer who pressed his knee down on the unarmed, handcuffed black man or eight minutes. was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. While protests that started off peacefully in Atlantic City and Trenton turned violent on Sunday night, marches in Franklin Township (Somerset), Long Branch, Princeton and Rahway did not. A march organized in Franklin Township in Somerset County drew a crowd of about 200, according to Director Quovella M. Spruill. Video of the event posted by Denniston Bonadie showed a large crowd marching from the Franklin Middle School to Saint Sharbel Church, holding signs that read ""No justice, no peace"" and ""End police brutality Black Lives Matter."" “It is important that we do not allow the events occurring around the nation to divide us now. We have work to do, but it is possible when we do it together,"" Spruill said in a statement, adding that her officers are held to the highest standards possible. She assured the community that ""our officers will treat everyone they encounter with professionalism, dignity and respect."" Protesters were escorted by Long Branch police from Pier Village on Ocean Avenue through the city to police headquarters, according to the Asbury Park Press's coverage of the march. At headquarters the group chanted ""hands up, don't shoot,"" according to the Press report. George Floyd protest in Rahway (Mayor Raymond Giacobbe) Rahway mayor Raymond Giacobbe posted pictures of a protest in his city on his Facebook page. ""I support peaceful protest. We must learn to not only talk, but listen to one another. I’m very proud of my city,"" Giacobbe wrote. A small group that gathered with signs in Princeton was joined by officer Courtney Navas, according to a message on the Princeton police Twitter account. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka joined a march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, in protest against the police killing of Floyd. In Camden County, police took part in a Saturday unity walk, ""to stand in solidarity and unity with all residents who are rightfully angered, concerned and upset about the actions of the officers in Minneapolis and the murder of George Floyd,"" Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in a written statement. More vigils and marches are scheduled for Monday. The Southern Burlington County, the Willingboro and Vicinity and the Greater Delaware Valley Branches of the NAACP are joining with the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office for a virtual candlelight vigil at 8:19 p.m. on Monday to mark one week since Floyd died. ""We invite members of the public, local police departments, houses of worship and community organizations to post on their Facebook page a simple photo of a lit candle and engage in eight minutes and 46 seconds of reflection over the LIFE of George Floyd and the tragic events that have unfolded in the aftermath of his death, including the violence that has erupted out of peaceful protests,"" the prosecutor's office wrote on its Facebook page.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,’ we had leadership that could unequivocally say, ‘When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'” Barber wrote. Trump wasn’t alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light ’em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Share widely: National guard and MPD sweeping our residential street. Shooting paint canisters at us on our own front porch.

Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn’t “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd’s neck was pinned under Chauvin’s knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives’ Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,” the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday.

1622319975,2020-06-01 10:02:27,"Erie woman who was kicked by police officer says, ’I was 100 percent peaceful’",https://whyy.org/articles/erie-woman-who-was-kicked-by-police-officer-says-i-was-100-percent-peaceful/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"This story originally appeared on PA Post. Hannah Silbaugh decided to stay in the street. “We were protesting what the cops were doing and I wasn’t going to comply with them saying to leave,” Silbaugh said. “I wanted to exercise my right to peaceful protest. And I was 100 percent peaceful.” Protests started in Erie.. a girl here was peacefully protesting, after 15 minutes she was maced and kicked.. #PoliceBrutality pic.twitter.com/nC6HhXMpCe — Nick / nak5132 🍐 (@the7goonies) May 31, 2020 The choice led to her being kicked to the ground. Multiple people captured the kick on video, and her case quickly gained national attention, thanks to social media. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and others condemned the police officer’s action after seeing the video. “This level of unnecessary use of force, along with all other instances of it across Pennsylvania yesterday, is unacceptable and diminishes us all,” Fetterman wrote on Twitter late Sunday afternoon. One video from the incident had 5 million views on Twitter shortly before 9:30 p.m. Sunday. It’s a two second video, showing an officer in riot gear and a protective helmet kicking Silbaugh as she sits covering her face. A longer video — which shows more of the street — appears to show officers spraying Silbaugh and multiple other people with some type of eye-irritant spray. The Saturday evening demonstration in Erie was one of many taking place across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck as he begged for air. Silbaugh, a 21-year-old Erie resident who works as a manager at a retail store, said she wanted to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. “It’s very important to me because, yes, I am white, and yes, I have the privilege,” she said, “but there are .. blacks folks and (persons of color) that are dying and being injured by the hands of police brutality. And I think we all need to stand up.” She said she arrived at the protest around 8 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. She said the crowd “was rowdy, but they weren’t violent.” But the situation got worse. Silbaugh said she thinks the actions of police officers escalated the tension. The Erie City Police Department in a statement said the peaceful protest turned into a riot “when about 400 people descended on Erie City Hall.” The statement said protesters pounded on the doors, spray painted the building and shattered windows. The department said officers gave multiple warnings and released colored smoke, before calling in the SWAT team. At one point, Silbaugh said she and some other demonstrators positioned themselves between police in riot gear and a larger group of protesters. She said police told them to move, but she chose not to. She said police sprayed some type of chemical — she wasn’t sure if it was mace or pepper spray. The others who were with her left. “But I decided to stay seated,” Silbaugh said. Silbaugh said she held her hands up in front of her eyes to protect herself from the chemical officers used. She stayed sitting. And then she felt herself hitting the ground — she didn’t understand why until later. She said police told her that if she didn’t move, she would be tazed. She said she ran to the nearest side street to look for a bottle of water. “At that point, I was so discombobulated. I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe,” she said. A stranger gave her a bottle of water, so she could wash her eyes out. It seemed to her that there was more violence occurring in the streets, and she decided she wasn’t safe there. She went home and checked her phone and social media to look for updates and to see if everyone was safe. Then she saw a short video of a police officer kicking a person who was sitting on the ground. “I was like, ‘Oh, my goodness, that’s me,’” she said. She looked at more posts and found a longer video. Watching it felt different than experiencing it the first time. When she was in the street, she was confused, and knew she was being pushed around and sprayed. But the video gave her a clearer understanding of what happened. “It was really kind of an out of body experience because that’s the things that I’ve been seeing on the news,” she said. “And it happened to me, and it was just absolutely insane to see that happen.” Silbaugh said she stayed up all night. She didn’t go to an emergency room. After a few hours, she called a number for poison control because she still felt a “really horrible burning sensations” and was told to wait it out. She tried putting in contact lenses Sunday morning but it was too painful. She said she took cold showers to try to help, but even on Sunday evening she said she still felt the burning sensation in her arms and hands. She felt sore, especially where her body hit the ground. She said she had some bruises, but with all the chaos of the night, she wasn’t certain what caused them. A statement from the Erie City Police Department didn’t directly address Silbaugh’s case, but said police have “several hundreds of hours of videos to watch” and would review them. The department invited anyone who would like to make a formal complaint to do so. The police department said more than a dozen officers suffered injuries “from bruises, cuts and scrapes, to gashes and burns.” The department said the riot gear officers wore prevented them from being seriously injured or killed. “(W)hile our officers were being hit with bricks, rocks, water bottles, and fireworks, they just took it all. They showed a lot of restraint, held the line, and did not fire a single shot,” the department said. Pennsylvania State Police and the Millcreek Police Department assisted. In a news conference early Sunday evening, Erie Mayor Joe Schember said 11 businesses in downtown Erie were “hurt very badly,” and he described fire damage and broken windows there. Schember said he saw a video of a police officer striking Silbaugh, and that the city would investigate the case. “Obviously, it’s very brief. I know for a fact that police tried to get her to move very politely for quite a while,” Schember said. “Their line could not move beyond until she moved.” Schember said she wasn’t doing anything wrong, “but she was preventing the police from stopping the people behind her.”] At another point in the news conference, Schember called it “a terrible video.” The city has not identified the officer who is shown in the video striking Silbaugh. Frank Strumila, a media strategist for the city, said the investigation is ongoing. On Sunday evening, Silbaugh said she had not reached out to the police department, and she wasn’t sure if she would file a formal complaint or take any other action. She was grateful for all the support she has received. “I have received an outpouring of love,” she said. “…I have hundreds of people, you know, checking on me, making sure that I’m OK.”  ",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said.

Floyd's death sparked violent protests and unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul that spread nationwide and led to a lockdown of the White House on Friday. The four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest have been fired. Officer Derek Chauvin, a white officer who pressed his knee down on the unarmed, handcuffed black man or eight minutes. was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. While protests that started off peacefully in Atlantic City and Trenton turned violent on Sunday night, marches in Franklin Township (Somerset), Long Branch, Princeton and Rahway did not. A march organized in Franklin Township in Somerset County drew a crowd of about 200, according to Director Quovella M. Spruill. Video of the event posted by Denniston Bonadie showed a large crowd marching from the Franklin Middle School to Saint Sharbel Church, holding signs that read ""No justice, no peace"" and ""End police brutality Black Lives Matter."" “It is important that we do not allow the events occurring around the nation to divide us now. We have work to do, but it is possible when we do it together,"" Spruill said in a statement, adding that her officers are held to the highest standards possible. She assured the community that ""our officers will treat everyone they encounter with professionalism, dignity and respect."" Protesters were escorted by Long Branch police from Pier Village on Ocean Avenue through the city to police headquarters, according to the Asbury Park Press's coverage of the march. At headquarters the group chanted ""hands up, don't shoot,"" according to the Press report. George Floyd protest in Rahway (Mayor Raymond Giacobbe) Rahway mayor Raymond Giacobbe posted pictures of a protest in his city on his Facebook page. ""I support peaceful protest. We must learn to not only talk, but listen to one another. I’m very proud of my city,"" Giacobbe wrote. A small group that gathered with signs in Princeton was joined by officer Courtney Navas, according to a message on the Princeton police Twitter account. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka joined a march organized by the civil rights group The People's Organization for Progress, in protest against the police killing of Floyd. In Camden County, police took part in a Saturday unity walk, ""to stand in solidarity and unity with all residents who are rightfully angered, concerned and upset about the actions of the officers in Minneapolis and the murder of George Floyd,"" Police Chief Joe Wysocki said in a written statement. More vigils and marches are scheduled for Monday. The Southern Burlington County, the Willingboro and Vicinity and the Greater Delaware Valley Branches of the NAACP are joining with the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office for a virtual candlelight vigil at 8:19 p.m. on Monday to mark one week since Floyd died. ""We invite members of the public, local police departments, houses of worship and community organizations to post on their Facebook page a simple photo of a lit candle and engage in eight minutes and 46 seconds of reflection over the LIFE of George Floyd and the tragic events that have unfolded in the aftermath of his death, including the violence that has erupted out of peaceful protests,"" the prosecutor's office wrote on its Facebook page. A protest is planned in Asbury Park on Monday in front of the post office on Bangs Avenue, according to a statement from police, which denounced the action of the officers involved with Floyd's death. Assemblyman Jamel Holley said a peaceful demonstration is scheduled for Tuesday with protesters in their cars driving on Woodbridge Avenue from the border with Edison to the Raritan Bridge. “The demonstration will be focused on ensuring that George Floyd and all people of color receive fair justice.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown.

Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

With that thought in mind he contacted a few friends and organized at peaceful protest on May 30. The rally, which progressively grew, was held in an intersection of Route 9 in Freehold Township near iPlay America and a Burger King. It ran from 1 to nearly 7 p.m. and drew around 40 people. Protests continue across the country over the death of George Floyd, 46, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer who cut off his air supply with a knee to his throat on May 25. That officer, Derek Chauvin, and three officers were fired a day later after a video of the incident went viral. Chauvin, who is white, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter days later. Protestors have been demanding charges for the other officers involved.

(Photo by Bob Vosseller) Protests, many of which included rioting, arson, looting and violence occurred in the days that followed in several large cities. However, there have also been many peaceful protests. “Due to the recent event of the murder of George Floyd, we have assembled this peaceful protest to stand in solidarity with the people of Minneapolis, Denver, Louisville, Los Angeles, and anywhere else that has experienced police brutality,” Hubner said. Hubner who is going into his junior year of college added, “I got tired of seeing what has been going on in the world and tired of seeing people in my community not doing anything about what is going on so I decided it would be good to have a peaceful protest. This is very last minute but all yesterday I was rallying to get people to come and since the virus is still here we still need to social distance so I’ve been setting up places along the sidewalk six feet apart marked with duct tape so we can all peacefully protest and not have to worry about contracting the virus.” Gustaveo Lagoes also of Howell, knew Hubner since Middle School. “He contacted me on short notice about setting up a protest.” Lagoes had helped with a similar protest staged at the same location about two years ago. Howell resident Nick Hubner organized a peaceful protest for George Floyd who died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a police officer cut off his oxygen supply while having his knee to his throat. (Photo by Bob Vosseller) “We were getting tired of not taking any action so we decided to come out today and show our support for George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement,” Lagoes said. A township police officer did briefly stop by and provided a friendly reminder to be careful when entering the crosswalk and intersection for traveling cars. Many honked their horns and cheered in support throughout the afternoon. A few of the protestors were hesitant to provide their names for this story. Aisha Battle said that while she and others were wearing their masks for safety reasons and also to protect their identity that “at the end of the day everyone can take their masks off and no one will even know you were here. When I go home, I have no mask. This is who I am every day. I don’t get to go home and take a mask off and act like this never happened. “I’m a single parent and it is difficult seeing this repetitive behavior of aggression of officers…At the same time as a community we need to stop making excuses and justifying the behavior,” said. Photo by Bob Vosseller She added, “as a community I think we need to begin to understand that we are all in this together and a lot of white people don’t help the situation when they deny the fact of what is happening. We have to stop saying we are all one race, the human race. The truth is we are all different. We have to accept those differences and understand those differences because then we can start to understand each other.” “By me acknowledging that there are white, black, Asian people doesn’t make me a racist. It means I am able to use my eyes and see that we are all come from different backgrounds. When you begin to have that conversation, you begin to have a better understanding and officers will know how to deal with people in a different manner rather than thinking everyone should conform to one size fits all. We need to respect each other’s differences,” Battle said. Malik Ali came from Brooklyn N.Y. and has family in the area. He was not only a participant in the rally but was also documenting it. He found out about the protest by having seen it while driving. “I think that the society we live in has never healed from the 30s, the 40s, the 50s, and a lot of those inhuman thoughts, demonic thoughts that white supremacy had in the 40s – they never healed from that,” Ali said. Photo by Bob Vosseller “It has just been passed on from generation to generation so when you see something like what happened the other day – that is the result of someone who has so much hatred and fear in him of another human being because of his complexion. That was a display of the anger and was so out of control knowing he was being filmed, he still couldn’t control himself,” Ali added. “There has to be some form of healing on both sides because we as black people are still traumatized from slavery so we need healing but those seeds of the forefathers of those oppressors they need to be healed. You can’t have a world of injustice. A world of inhuman people and white supremacy and then one day you say, okay, here is the Civil Rights Bill everything is okay, let’s move forward.” Ali said that it was evident that there was “a mental, spiritual, emotional wound from the oppressor. In his mind there was damage there so to say there is a Civil Rights movement, we don’t do this anymore but that wound is still there emotionally. It will still go on from generation to generation to generation and that is why in 2020 we are still in the condition we are in because there was never any healing put in place.” Photo by Bob Vosseller Laurie Martin is an area resident who found out at 1 p.m. that a rally was going on. “I’ve been devasted by the current events and I fail to understand why the police weren’t charged the minute the video came out. I am here to express my outrage. It is better than crying on the couch.” Martin added regarding the numerous rioting occurring in cities across the countries that “it is horrible and could have been avoided had those officers been charged when that video became available to all of us. No one would be rioting. We wouldn’t be standing here if they weren’t immediately arrested. There are many good police officers. More good than bad but the bad need to be held accountable and right away.” Payton Mckiney, a high school senior of Freehold Township drew a picture of George Floyd and was holding it during the rally. “I am actually selling the portraits and 100% of the proceeds are going to the cause. I wanted to come out here today and support the cause so I showed up and it is nice seeing everyone here supporting it.”",0.0

Hubner who is going into his junior year of college added, “I got tired of seeing what has been going on in the world and tired of seeing people in my community not doing anything about what is going on so I decided it would be good to have a peaceful protest. This is very last minute but all yesterday I was rallying to get people to come and since the virus is still here we still need to social distance so I’ve been setting up places along the sidewalk six feet apart marked with duct tape so we can all peacefully protest and not have to worry about contracting the virus.” Gustaveo Lagoes also of Howell, knew Hubner since Middle School. “He contacted me on short notice about setting up a protest.” Lagoes had helped with a similar protest staged at the same location about two years ago.

I don’t get to go home and take a mask off and act like this never happened. “I’m a single parent and it is difficult seeing this repetitive behavior of aggression of officers…At the same time as a community we need to stop making excuses and justifying the behavior,” said. Photo by Bob Vosseller She added, “as a community I think we need to begin to understand that we are all in this together and a lot of white people don’t help the situation when they deny the fact of what is happening. We have to stop saying we are all one race, the human race. The truth is we are all different. We have to accept those differences and understand those differences because then we can start to understand each other.” “By me acknowledging that there are white, black, Asian people doesn’t make me a racist. It means I am able to use my eyes and see that we are all come from different backgrounds. When you begin to have that conversation, you begin to have a better understanding and officers will know how to deal with people in a different manner rather than thinking everyone should conform to one size fits all. We need to respect each other’s differences,” Battle said. Malik Ali came from Brooklyn N.Y. and has family in the area. He was not only a participant in the rally but was also documenting it. He found out about the protest by having seen it while driving. “I think that the society we live in has never healed from the 30s, the 40s, the 50s, and a lot of those inhuman thoughts, demonic thoughts that white supremacy had in the 40s – they never healed from that,” Ali said.

You can’t have a world of injustice. A world of inhuman people and white supremacy and then one day you say, okay, here is the Civil Rights Bill everything is okay, let’s move forward.” Ali said that it was evident that there was “a mental, spiritual, emotional wound from the oppressor. In his mind there was damage there so to say there is a Civil Rights movement, we don’t do this anymore but that wound is still there emotionally. It will still go on from generation to generation to generation and that is why in 2020 we are still in the condition we are in because there was never any healing put in place.” Photo by Bob Vosseller Laurie Martin is an area resident who found out at 1 p.m. that a rally was going on. “I’ve been devasted by the current events and I fail to understand why the police weren’t charged the minute the video came out.

More good than bad but the bad need to be held accountable and right away.” Payton Mckiney, a high school senior of Freehold Township drew a picture of George Floyd and was holding it during the rally. “I am actually selling the portraits and 100% of the proceeds are going to the cause.

With that thought in mind he contacted a few friends and organized at peaceful protest on May 30. The rally, which progressively grew, was held in an intersection of Route 9 in Freehold Township near iPlay America and a Burger King. It ran from 1 to nearly 7 p.m. and drew around 40 people. Protests continue across the country over the death of George Floyd, 46, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer who cut off his air supply with a knee to his throat on May 25. That officer, Derek Chauvin, and three officers were fired a day later after a video of the incident went viral. Chauvin, who is white, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter days later. Protestors have been demanding charges for the other officers involved.

1622399838,2020-05-31 20:20:14,Our journalists are being attacked while doing their jobs. This is unacceptable.,http://rssfeeds.northjersey.com/~/625707874/0/northjerseyopinion~Our-journalists-are-being-attacked-while-doing-their-jobs-This-is-unacceptable/,en,False,,65,"The Record - Hackensack,NJ ",http://www.northjersey.com/,"JC Reindl, a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, was withdrawing from a confrontational protest area in his city Saturday night when police began chasing him and several demonstrators with pepper spray. He lifted up his media badge but still got hit fully in the face. Police slapped a phone from a hand of a Free Press photographer as she streamed the scene live on USA TODAY. And police ran up to a black reporter from the Free Press and asked for his press ID while ignoring his white colleagues. He was trying to produce the credential while blinded by tear gas in the air. Free Press reporter David Jesse called it ""one of the craziest nights of my career. Got tear gassed multiple times. Police shot rubber bullets at us even though we were moving where they wanted us to go, holding up our press passes and yelling 'media.'"" This is what happened at just one protest, in one city, over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. But the actions — attacking journalists who clearly identified themselves as media, not interfering with police business — occurred all across the country at protests this weekend. This is unacceptable. Reporters and photographers are there to record the truth, as peaceful or as violent as it may be. We are considered public servants in this role, not part of the protests but there to document it for the American people. We accept the risks. At times, protesters or looters turn on us. This happened to our reporter in Fayetteville, North Carolina, who was left with a concussion. When we get pepper sprayed as part of a larger crowd, we understand and are prepared for it. We had dozens of journalists caught in this situation in the past several days. They washed out their eyes and got back to work. A few ended up in the emergency room. But when police target us as we stand off to the side or back from the action, reporting, recording, interviewing, that is not an accident. In many cases this weekend, we had to fight for our right to even cover the actions. When a curfew was first enacted in Minneapolis, it did not exempt journalists. After an outcry, the governor quickly rectified the situation. In Phoenix, the police sent a warning to journalists that if and when law enforcement declared an unlawful assembly, which is when ""a group of people are involved in criminal activity and are posing a danger to themselves or others,"" reporters could be arrested along with those they were covering. Media outlets, led by the Arizona Republic, fought back and got this apology from Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams, ""The Phoenix Police Department fully supports the free press and journalists’ right to report the news. In no way do we intend to curtail your right to collect and report the news."" We're fighting for our right to bring you the facts. And once we get there, we're too often getting attacked for doing just that. To be sure, we have a respectful and professional relationship with law enforcement across the country. And it's important to note that we are not suggesting that journalists deserve special treatment or that an attack on a member of the press is more significant than an attack on a peaceful protester. It is outrageous whenever citizens who are peacefully assembling, exercising their First Amendment rights, are met with this level of force. We understand that police are under incredible stress in these situations. It's a tense scene. Some may call these accidents part of the fog of war. But to those journalists who have been targeted, it sure doesn't feel that way. Tyler J. Davis, a Des Moines Register reporter, was in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday as police began to pepper spray two women being told to move away. Davis pulled out his camera to record the incident when, he said, ""the officer redirected his chemical spray from the fleeing duo toward me. He laid on the trigger for a few seconds as I told him I was a member of the media."" And this goes well beyond the USA TODAY Network. Colleagues around the country faced similar treatment: This is unacceptable. Let us be clear. We stand with our USA TODAY Network reporters and photographers. We stand with our peers in the field across the country. We stand with all who value a free and independent press. We must be able to do our jobs safely. We call for an immediate end to law enforcement harassment and targeting of journalists who are clearly identified, not interfering in police activity and just doing their jobs: Bringing truth to the American people.

1622420208,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.waynepost.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,318723,waynepost.com,http://waynepost.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Floyd's death, allegedly caused during a confrontation with a police officer in Minneapolis, has sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. Images of the officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd's neck went viral late last week. Floyd was the latest in a string of unarmed black people killed during a police encounter. The scenes in New Jersey were reminiscent of those across the country. Protests were varied — ranging from peaceful and small to large and chaotic. Here's what happened across the state this weekend: Trenton What began as a peaceful protest on Sunday turned into ""lawlessness"" by day's end. It began with the looting of a sneaker store and liquor store. When police responded to control the crowds, mayhem ensued. Images from the scene show groups of people smashing three SUVs believed to be unmarked police vehicles. Other vehicles were lit on fire and flipped over by protesters. Trenton city officials issued an 8 p.m. curfew in response, and Mayor Reed Gusciora said the ""lockdown"" would remain. ""We want this city open as soon as possible,"" Gusciora said during a news conference. ""This sets us backwards ... We're going to be on lockdown. And we're not going to tolerate lawlessness."" Atlantic City The city instituted an 8 p.m. curfew after a peaceful Sunday protest turned into what police called ""criminal activity. ""If you can, avoid Atlantic City at this time,"" the police department later tweeted. According to the Press of Atlantic City, the protest led to clashes with police officers and looting. ""I'm shamed, embarrassed, hurt. Media from all around the world (are) calling me because of what happened in Atlantic City tonight,"" Mayor Marty Small said, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Y'all set us back today. ... Y'all let it happen."" Newark An estimated 5,000 people — including Mayor Ras Baraka — gathered around a statute of Abraham Lincoln in front of the city courthouse, many wearing black as a sign of mourning. ""We have to give people the room to be outraged,"" Baraka said. ""This is not just about Floyd. We're talking hundreds of years of lynching... or purposeful, systemic abuse simply because they have another hue."" Police orchestrated traffic around the protesters as they marched east on Market Street from the courthouse, while organizers from the People's Organization for Progress handed out markers, poster boards and water to demonstrators. West Orange teacher Ashley Barnes brought her kids to the protest: ""My children need to witness that their mother raised her voice in protest. We need to tell our black men how we love them and care about them."" Camden Police and elected officials joined in on a protest and march on Saturday, helping to carry signs and chanting ""black lives matter"" alongside protesters. A photograph showing Camden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki carrying a sign alongside demonstrators went viral after the police department tweeted the photo out. In a statement Sunday, Wysocki said the department's participation in the march ""was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden."" Chief Wysocki on the march today, standing together with the residents we serve to remember and honor George Floyd. #StrongerTogether#CamdenStrongpic.twitter.com/UJAjxXkxrx — Camden County Police (@CamdenCountyPD) May 31, 2020 Long Branch Hundreds of people gathered at the Pier Village center on Sunday afternoon, as chants ""I can't breathe"" and ""black lives matter"" could be heard throughout the city. Police escorted the marchers through the city and provided traffic control. ""All of the protests that I've seen on TV, in and around the area, have been productive,"" said Highlands resident Kevin Martin. ""Some of them have been violent, but most have been peaceful. It kind of gives me a little hope to see everyone from different races and cultures here. And I kind of felt like I needed to see that."" Englewood More than 1,000 people gathered under the scorching hot sun on Saturday, marching from Mackay Park to the Englewood police station. They read the names of 84 black people who had been killed during police encounters — including Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and 16-year-old Phillip Pannell, a 16-year-old from Teaneck whose shooting death by police 30 years ago sparked riots in his hometown. “We are not just here for today. I got to let everyone know — if you are out here just for today, that’s not good enough for me,"" organizer Ainsworth Minott said. ""We are tired of the movements that are just for the moment.” Franklin (Somerset County) Two hundred people marched in protest of Floyd's death as part of a protest that was all about peace. ""One of the most beautiful, organized and peaceful protests,"" said Jennifer Engelhart, who participated in the march. ""There were no fights. There was no hatred. There were folks of all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, genders, cultures. This was love. One blood one love."" Another demonstration is scheduled for Tuesday in Highland Park, described as a caravan of cars with signs ""for George Floyd and all the brothers and sisters we lost to police brutality and vigilante type slayings."" On Sunday, approximately 200 Franklin Township residents and concerned citizens marched in support of lives lost and the injustices throughout the nation. (Photo: ~Courtesy of Jennifer Engelhart) Freehold A few dozen protesters lined Route 9 on Saturday afternoon, holding ""black lives matter"" signs but wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. “We want all the police officers to know that it's not right, it won't be tolerated,” Tyann Turner, one of the local protesters, told News 12. “Just because they have the badge, the gun, the baton and the pepper spray doesn’t mean they have the right to hurt someone.” Haddonfield Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Haddonfield on Sunday, which organizer Karinne Lindner said was to ""raise voices in our community against violence against people of color."" ""In support of our friends of color we made a point of saying this is a time for peaceful and vocal advocacy and promoting change,"" said organizer Meg Hollingworth said. The local police department helped coordinate the protest, and Chief Jason Cutler spoke at the beginning of the march. ""The Haddonfield Police Department was proud to support and participate in this event,"" Cutler posted to the department Facebook page later. ""Our hope is to build upon the words and actions of those who marched beside us today as we continue our commitment to combating bias and racism."" More than 300 residents of Haddonfield and surrounding communities peacefully demonstrate Sunday in Colonial downtown Haddonfield to support justice and protest violence against people of color following recent death of black victim George Floyd restrained by Minneapolis police last week. (Photo: Provided) Morristown Organizers coordinated a blocks-long ""funeral procession"" for Floyd and others on Saturday, in which hundreds of cars stretched from the Morristown High School parking lot to the Morristown Green. Drivers displayed signs reading ""I can't breathe"" and ""silence is betrayal,"" as police escorted the procession through Morristown and onto Woodland Avenue in Morris Township and onto the police department and Ginty Field, where a candlelight vigil was held. ""The events that led to George Floyd’s death are glaringly clear,"" said attorney Kisha Pinnock, who participated in the procession. ""All over America, we are mourning. We are mourning the life of too many lives lost too for no other reason than they are people of color. We are scared, we are tired and we are grieving."" Hundreds of Morris County residents gathered in Morristown on Saturday to demand justice for George Floyd after he died at the hands of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. “Is this your business?” she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. “I’m sorry,” the woman says. It’s the first time they’ve seen it since fiery protests erupted in cries for racial justice and state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests Thursday and Friday night. “Alhamdulillah,” she repeats quietly. Praise God. “Everyone is safe.” “My heart is broken. My mind is broken,” she says. “I know I can’t come back from this. But this can be replaced. George’s life cannot. George’s life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.” George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee last Monday for several minutes. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd’s pleading words to the officer, “I can’t breathe,” are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there were no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page was set up to help the family. This weekend she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. “It’s not just me,” she says. “It’s all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis.” Her daughter Saida nods. “This is a city in pain,” Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads “Mama Safia’s Kitchen. Seasoned with Love.” “Because she always cooks with love,” Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven’t burned. “Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,” she says. “This one is from Somalia.” She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. “We can still use these,” she says. “We just have to wash them.” She searches for more things she can save. “The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,” Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. “It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,” Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It’s a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. “She’s just saying, ‘Why are you bringing me in here? I don’t want to see this,’ ” Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people’s minds. “I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?” Saida shakes her head. “2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What’s next?” Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. “I’m like emotionally torn,” Saida says. She doesn’t want destruction. “But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, ‘Fix this.’ ” She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change.",0.0

They read the names of 84 black people who had been killed during police encounters — including Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and 16-year-old Phillip Pannell, a 16-year-old from Teaneck whose shooting death by police 30 years ago sparked riots in his hometown. “We are not just here for today. I got to let everyone know — if you are out here just for today, that’s not good enough for me,"" organizer Ainsworth Minott said. ""We are tired of the movements that are just for the moment.” Franklin (Somerset County) Two hundred people marched in protest of Floyd's death as part of a protest that was all about peace. ""One of the most beautiful, organized and peaceful protests,"" said Jennifer Engelhart, who participated in the march. ""There were no fights. There was no hatred. There were folks of all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, genders, cultures. This was love. One blood one love."" Another demonstration is scheduled for Tuesday in Highland Park, described as a caravan of cars with signs ""for George Floyd and all the brothers and sisters we lost to police brutality and vigilante type slayings."" On Sunday, approximately 200 Franklin Township residents and concerned citizens marched in support of lives lost and the injustices throughout the nation. (Photo: ~Courtesy of Jennifer Engelhart) Freehold A few dozen protesters lined Route 9 on Saturday afternoon, holding ""black lives matter"" signs but wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. “We want all the police officers to know that it's not right, it won't be tolerated,” Tyann Turner, one of the local protesters, told News 12. “Just because they have the badge, the gun, the baton and the pepper spray doesn’t mean they have the right to hurt someone.” Haddonfield Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Haddonfield on Sunday, which organizer Karinne Lindner said was to ""raise voices in our community against violence against people of color."" ""In support of our friends of color we made a point of saying this is a time for peaceful and vocal advocacy and promoting change,"" said organizer Meg Hollingworth said. The local police department helped coordinate the protest, and Chief Jason Cutler spoke at the beginning of the march. ""The Haddonfield Police Department was proud to support and participate in this event,"" Cutler posted to the department Facebook page later. ""Our hope is to build upon the words and actions of those who marched beside us today as we continue our commitment to combating bias and racism.""

Drivers displayed signs reading ""I can't breathe"" and ""silence is betrayal,"" as police escorted the procession through Morristown and onto Woodland Avenue in Morris Township and onto the police department and Ginty Field, where a candlelight vigil was held. ""The events that led to George Floyd’s death are glaringly clear,"" said attorney Kisha Pinnock, who participated in the procession. ""All over America, we are mourning. We are mourning the life of too many lives lost too for no other reason than they are people of color. We are scared, we are tired and we are grieving.""

1622443859,2020-06-01 11:20:00,"Their stores were burned, ransacked and looted. What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.waynepost.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,318723,waynepost.com,http://waynepost.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Floyd's death, allegedly caused during a confrontation with a police officer in Minneapolis, has sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. Images of the officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd's neck went viral late last week. Floyd was the latest in a string of unarmed black people killed during a police encounter. The scenes in New Jersey were reminiscent of those across the country. Protests were varied — ranging from peaceful and small to large and chaotic. Here's what happened across the state this weekend: Trenton What began as a peaceful protest on Sunday turned into ""lawlessness"" by day's end. It began with the looting of a sneaker store and liquor store. When police responded to control the crowds, mayhem ensued. Images from the scene show groups of people smashing three SUVs believed to be unmarked police vehicles. Other vehicles were lit on fire and flipped over by protesters. Trenton city officials issued an 8 p.m. curfew in response, and Mayor Reed Gusciora said the ""lockdown"" would remain. ""We want this city open as soon as possible,"" Gusciora said during a news conference. ""This sets us backwards ... We're going to be on lockdown. And we're not going to tolerate lawlessness."" Atlantic City The city instituted an 8 p.m. curfew after a peaceful Sunday protest turned into what police called ""criminal activity. ""If you can, avoid Atlantic City at this time,"" the police department later tweeted. According to the Press of Atlantic City, the protest led to clashes with police officers and looting. ""I'm shamed, embarrassed, hurt. Media from all around the world (are) calling me because of what happened in Atlantic City tonight,"" Mayor Marty Small said, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Y'all set us back today. ... Y'all let it happen."" Newark An estimated 5,000 people — including Mayor Ras Baraka — gathered around a statute of Abraham Lincoln in front of the city courthouse, many wearing black as a sign of mourning. ""We have to give people the room to be outraged,"" Baraka said. ""This is not just about Floyd. We're talking hundreds of years of lynching... or purposeful, systemic abuse simply because they have another hue."" Police orchestrated traffic around the protesters as they marched east on Market Street from the courthouse, while organizers from the People's Organization for Progress handed out markers, poster boards and water to demonstrators. West Orange teacher Ashley Barnes brought her kids to the protest: ""My children need to witness that their mother raised her voice in protest. We need to tell our black men how we love them and care about them."" Camden Police and elected officials joined in on a protest and march on Saturday, helping to carry signs and chanting ""black lives matter"" alongside protesters. A photograph showing Camden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki carrying a sign alongside demonstrators went viral after the police department tweeted the photo out. In a statement Sunday, Wysocki said the department's participation in the march ""was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden.""

Police escorted the marchers through the city and provided traffic control. ""All of the protests that I've seen on TV, in and around the area, have been productive,"" said Highlands resident Kevin Martin. ""Some of them have been violent, but most have been peaceful.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015.

After a peaceful demonstration and march on the boardwalk Sunday afternoon, looters began smashing windows at the Tanger Outlets Atlantic City shopping area during the early evening along three blocks of Baltic Avenue. ""The city of Atlantic City was under siege yesterday,"" Small said during a media briefing at the outlet center where volunteers reported to help clean up. The mayor said a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will be in effect daily until June 8. A curfew was put into effect on Sunday night by police right after the looting. Small said of the 17 people arrested during the looting, only six were from Atlantic City, with the others from both ""out of state"" and from other New Jersey municipalities but he did not specify from where. The mayor also did not say what those who were arrested were charged with or if they were being held. Atlantic City police spokesman Kevin Fair told New Jersey 101.5 200 to 300 people were protesting on Sunday night. Fair said he was was preparing a statement about the arrests for release on Monday afternoon. Small said he spoke with Steve Tanger, CEO of Tanger Outlets, who said he was disappointed at the protests but assured him that repairs will be made to the 20 damaged stores and the center will reopen. ""He said 'Mayor, we gotta work together to build this back up. And I pledge our 100% full support,'"" Small said. Non-essential retail stores, including the Outlet's 70 stores, have been closed in New Jersey by executive order by Gov. Phil Murphy to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Some of the stores lost their entire inventory, Small said Tanger told him. He noted that surveillance video was operating in the stores during the looting. The All Wars Memorial Building, also called the Soliders Home, was also vandalized, according to Small, with food and supplies stolen that were to be used for the preparation of hot meals for nearly 4,000 seniors twice a week. Sixty State Police troopers reported to Atlantic City on Sunday night and another 50 came in Monday, according to the mayor. He said he would consider bringing in the National Guard if looting and protests were to continue. ""All options are on the table,"" Small said when asked if he would consider bringing in National Guard troops. He said Gov. Phil Murphy has pledged whatever the city needs to clean up after the vandalism. Enter your number to get our free mobile app During a late-night media briefing the mayor held hours after the looting, Small said he was ""pissed"" and disappointed at the behavior and the ""embarrassment"" it brought to the city he was was ready to reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic. Murphy hinted that casinos may reopen in time for the July 4 holiday during an interview with Atlantic City radio station WOND, according to NJ.com coverage of the interview. ""It's unacceptable, it's unfortunate and it's sad that we as a city let some outsiders come in and trash our town, destroy our businesses while all the Atlantic City people who participated let it happen,"" Small said Sunday night, He was especially upset at people who did Facebook Live broadcasts instead of trying to stop it. ""This is our city. And only things like this happen in Atlantic City because we let it happen. And it's a damn shame. Everybody should be disappointed. It's hurtful,"" Small said. ""Today is Atlantic City at it's worst,"" Small said. The Atlantic City Expressway, which was also closed in both directions at Atlantic Avenue, was reopened on Monday morning.

Other students believe an in-person ceremony would be dangerous and selfish. Asbury Park Press MIDDLETOWN - Students from both the township's public high schools turned out Monday morning to protest the district's decision to hold a virtual graduation ceremony instead of an in-person event as a matter of safety during the present COVID-19 pandemic. Many of their classmates, however, support the district's decision, and believe a traditional ceremony would be dangerous and selfish. Several dozen students gathered in masks outside the Board of Education's headquarters on Leonardsville Road, waving signs and placards at passing cars and sporting gear from their respective high schools. ""We just want an effort from our town,"" said Marina Uliano, president of Middletown High School South's senior class. ""We understand that maybe once July, August comes, it might not be safe still to have a graduation. But the fact that other towns are putting plans in place to possibly have one, once the numbers are lifted, it's just not fair. They're giving up on us.""

Phil Murphy announced May 26 that in-person graduation ceremonies would be allowed beginning July 6, but with heavy restrictions. It remains unclear whether the state intends to lift the limit on in-person gatherings of 25 people to allow for larger graduation ceremonies. ""Based on the current attendance limit of 25 individuals and the number of graduates at both high schools, which is approximately 750 students, there would be a need to hold 80 to 90 separate ceremonies, with graduates only and no parents or other spectators in attendance,"" district Superintendent William O.

Cherry Hill Courier-Post ATLANTIC CITY - The morning after a peaceful protest turned ugly, dozens from Atlantic City and the surrounding community gathered at the Tanger Outlets to cleanup. At least 20 stores were damaged Sunday night, Mayor Marty Small said at a news conference Monday, and some stores had their inventory wiped out. On Monday morning, some windows remained smashed, and other stores had begun to board up. Small said a total of 17 arrests were made, and only six arrested were from the city. He said over 500 had participated in the looting, which began as a second wave after a peaceful protest marched through the city. A list of those arrested released later Monday showed the 11 arrested from outside the city came from towns across New Jersey, and as far north as Jersey City and West New York.

(Photo: Adam Monacelli/Courier-Post) Peaceful protests during the day Sunday calling for justice for people of color and opposition to violence and mistreatment by police gave way to looting and destruction later in the evening. The death of George Floyd last week has not only sparked outrage and peaceful protests, but also looting, rioting and fires in major cities across the nation, including Philadelphia. In addition to the at least 20 stores that were damaged in Atlantic City, Small said the city’s War Memorial building, where a meal program for seniors was operating out of during the coronavirus crisis, was ransacked. A 7 p.m. curfew is in effect until June 8. “You saw Atlantic City at its worst yesterday,” Small said, surrounded by dozens with brooms and trash bags at the intersection of Arctic and Atlantic avenues. “And once again, you Atlantic City at its best, people rallying to clean up,” Small said. Following Small’s conference, the crowd dispersed to clean up smashed glass and trash along the shopping area known as The Walk. “I wanted to do something productive,” said Tiffany Gordon, 25, of Pleasantville on why she showed up to cleanup.

The four longtime friends were disappointed in the previous day’s looting. “His (George Floyd) killing wasn’t for us to go out here and break into stores, and allow outsiders to come in. It was for us to make a point that black lives matter, that all lives matter,” Johnson, 17, said. The four friends made sure to pitch in Monday to make sure their favorite summer hang-out spot would be ready whenever businesses are allowed to be open again. “This is our city,” Johnson said, calling Monday’s event “true A.C. love.” “I’m never surprised when our city comes together,” Frederick, 17, said.

George Clinton (Photo: William Thoren) Clinton included Gaye's lyrics and a quote from the late Nelson Mandela in the post.

1622486360,2020-06-01 13:17:58,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,https://whyy.org/articles/biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-local-church-amid-unrest/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"Joe Biden vowed to address “institutional racism” in his first 100 days in office, if elected, as he met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in Delaware on Monday morning amid the coronavirus pandemic to address exploding racial tensions that have begun to reshape the upcoming presidential election. Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, Biden gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate hometown meeting ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden said, his face mask lowered around his chin, after several participants shared their thoughts on police brutality. If elected, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office. Biden’s low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer approach may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.",0.0

Catch-22 was the novel by Joseph Heller that coined the phrase used more broadly to mean a problem for which there’s a no good solution. A no-win situation. If a handcuffed, unarmed black man is killed needlessly by the police and the black community peacefully protests, nothing changes. If a handcuffed, unarmed black man is killed needlessly by the police and the black community erupts in anger and violence, THAT becomes the story and all the talk is about the senselessness of burning down your own community. To the people who are talking more about this than you are about George Floyd, I have a question for you and an idea for you. Have you ever gotten so mad at a situation, so angry about a spouse cheating on you or some huge unfairness happening on your job, that you slammed a door, pounded your fist on your dashboard, or maybe even broke something you owned or put a fist through your own wall in disgust? See the episode of Atypical when Doug reacts to Elsa’s cheating on him for example. Doesn’t make much sense to punch your own wall, does it? But that’s just how goddamn angry you are. What’s happening across our country is the societal version of the same thing. I’m not saying it makes sense. I’m certainly not saying it’s right nor am I saying it’s acceptable. I’m saying if you don’t understand from where the anger is coming you can’t speak thoughtfully on the matter. An idea to help you understand this anger? Watch this video. Not just a minute or two. Watch the whole thing. And please watch it three times. Note: This video contains profanity and violence but is being posted due to significant social importance First, remember that George Floyd was already down on the ground, unarmed, with his arms handcuffed behind his back. Watch it all the way through focusing only on George Floyd. Look only at his face. Hear his strain as he tells the officers he’s in trouble. Watch him go limp. Watch him become unresponsive. You’re seeing a man die. Keep watching, only his face, all the way to the end, and note how that knee never stops compressing his neck until the EMTs are ready to throw his limp body onto a gurney. Now watch it again and pay attention only to the bystanders who are begging with the police to let George Floyd breathe. No one is begging to release him from custody. Just let him breathe. These bystanders, while coarse in language, are clearly understanding what is happening to Floyd and they are desperately explaining it to the cops. They are telling them that they are killing this man. Now watch a third time and look only at Derek Chauvin, the officer whose knee remains compressing Floyd’s neck continuously. Watch his face as bystanders are imploring him to let this man live. He. Indifferently. Never. Listens. Not only does he not listen, he doesn’t even acknowledge them in any real way. This serves as a microcosm for what black America must have felt for so long now. They aren’t being heard, they aren’t being acknowledged. No one listens. The rage builds. There have been many incidents labeled as police brutality in which I side with the police. However there are plenty of others where you cannot with good conscience see it as anything but wrong. The Walter Scott shooting in South Carolina was one of these. That cop was sentenced to 20 years and justifiably so. This case is another. What happened in Minnesota was not a split second decision where an officer got it wrong in good faith. It was not the tragic byproduct of law enforcement doing a difficult job. What happened to George Floyd was a crime and that crime was murder. If you want to know why riots are happening, watch the damn video. If you’re not angry when you’re done then you’re part of the problem. The post above reflects the thoughts and observations of New Jersey 101.5 talk show host Jeff Deminski.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.waynepost.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,318723,waynepost.com,http://waynepost.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

Cherry Hill Courier-Post ATLANTIC CITY - The morning after a peaceful protest turned ugly, dozens from Atlantic City and the surrounding community gathered at the Tanger Outlets to cleanup. At least 20 stores were damaged Sunday night, Mayor Marty Small said at a news conference Monday, and some stores had their inventory wiped out. On Monday morning, some windows remained smashed, and other stores had begun to board up. Small said a total of 17 arrests were made, and only six arrested were from the city. He said over 500 had participated in the looting, which began as a second wave after a peaceful protest marched through the city. A list of those arrested released later Monday showed the 11 arrested from outside the city came from towns across New Jersey, and as far north as Jersey City and West New York. Small said the city police force received help from a total of 110 state troopers.

(Photo: Adam Monacelli/Courier-Post) Peaceful protests during the day Sunday calling for justice for people of color and opposition to violence and mistreatment by police gave way to looting and destruction later in the evening. The death of George Floyd last week has not only sparked outrage and peaceful protests, but also looting, rioting and fires in major cities across the nation, including Philadelphia. In addition to the at least 20 stores that were damaged in Atlantic City, Small said the city’s War Memorial building, where a meal program for seniors was operating out of during the coronavirus crisis, was ransacked. A 7 p.m. curfew is in effect until June 8. “You saw Atlantic City at its worst yesterday,” Small said, surrounded by dozens with brooms and trash bags at the intersection of Arctic and Atlantic avenues. “And once again, you Atlantic City at its best, people rallying to clean up,” Small said. Following Small’s conference, the crowd dispersed to clean up smashed glass and trash along the shopping area known as The Walk. “I wanted to do something productive,” said Tiffany Gordon, 25, of Pleasantville on why she showed up to cleanup. Antonio Cadavid-Valentin said he wasn’t surprised at Monday’s turnout.

There's a lot of support,” the Atlantic City resident said. “You know, from the beginning, even yesterday, you see all the posts by people speaking out against it (the looting).” The Walk is where Dewayne Johnson, Shawn Spellman, Ja’Heem Frederick and B.J. Borders hang out during summer vacation from Atlantic City High School. The four longtime friends were disappointed in the previous day’s looting. “His (George Floyd) killing wasn’t for us to go out here and break into stores, and allow outsiders to come in. It was for us to make a point that black lives matter, that all lives matter,” Johnson, 17, said. The four friends made sure to pitch in Monday to make sure their favorite summer hang-out spot would be ready whenever businesses are allowed to be open again. “This is our city,” Johnson said, calling Monday’s event “true A.C. love.” “I’m never surprised when our city comes together,” Frederick, 17, said.

Phil Murphy’s continuing ban on all indoor gatherings of 10 or more people. The services followed a lawsuit by the churches, and two others in South Jersey, that asks a federal judge in Camden to block Murphy’s executive orders shutting down most religious gatherings, claiming that the orders violate two clauses of the U.S. Constitution. More pressure on the ban on religious gatherings came on Friday with another lawsuit by 27 New Jersey churches, asking a federal court in Trenton to declare that religious services are “essential” services like supermarkets or hardware stores, contrasting with Murphy’s determination that religious services are not essential. Alyana Alfaro, a spokeswoman for Murphy, declined to comment on the litigation or on whether churches violating the orders would face enforcement action by police. She cited two executive orders limiting indoor gatherings including religious services to not more than 10 people, and 25 for outdoor gatherings. But she highlighted Murphy’s statement at Friday’s coronavirus press briefing indicating that restrictions on religious gatherings will be eased in coming weeks. “I anticipate being able to raise the limits on indoor gatherings in a way that will allow for greater indoor religious services for the weekend of June 12,” Murphy said in a transcript carried on Twitter. “We will continue working with our faith institutions to ensure our houses of worship are strong and safe.” Temperature checks, masks, social distancing In Millville, the Dwelling Place Pentecostal church opened on Sunday for its first indoor service since the state-ordered COVID-related shutdown began in March. All congregants were required to take a temperature test in the church lobby, masks were mandatory, and seating was spaced to conform with social-distancing guidelines, said the pastor, Bobby Bledsoe. To guard against the risk of infection, the church has been sanitized with professional-grade alcohol to standards approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and was run at a negative air pressure, meaning that the windows would be open at the same time the air conditioning is on to keep fresh air circulating, he said. The decision to reopen before the governor lifted the relevant orders was based on the reopening of some major retailers, beaches and boardwalks, raising questions about why religious institutions were still effectively locked down, Bledsoe said. “We didn’t mind closing to be a good neighbor and to follow what the governor said but when all these places have been opening, and you have 300-400 people in a Lowe’s or a grocery store, or you can go to the liquor store or get an abortion, and churches being nonessential, that’s when we decided we had to take a stand and let our voice be heard that we believe the church is essential,” he said. Credit: Jon Hurdle Associate pastor Franco Acevedo quoted the bible, urging believers not to be deterred from gathering even in the darkness, “and if you look around, it’s pretty dark,” he said, referring to the pandemic and Saturday’s riots in dozens of cities to protest the killing of George Floyd, an African American, by police in Minneapolis. “I would hope that as people see the hatred and the violence, they will say, ‘This is a time when I need to come and be healed spiritually and emotionally,” he said. “I would like to think we can provide a place for them to come, and to be loved, and to see a light in the darkness.” Not civil disobedience Acevedo acknowledged that Sunday’s reopening was pushing the limits of legality, but denied it was an act of civil disobedience. “We understand that we are pushing the boundaries a bit,” he said, in a parking lot interview. “This is not an act of civil disobedience intentionally. This is an act, I believe, of faith when we say that God is calling us to do, to maybe shake things up a little bit, maybe break some ice, maybe be trail blazers or pioneers to the next level of this new normal.” Another church in Clementon reportedly reopened over the weekend of May 16-17. Stephanie Gonzalez, 29, a pharmacy technician from Vineland, said she had been attending parking-lot services at the Dwelling Place church during the pandemic but, sitting in her car before Sunday’s service, was looking forward to the first indoor gathering since the building was closed by the executive orders. Credit: Jon Hurdle “It’s a blessing because we’re standing up for what we believe in, and everything else is open so why can’t we be?” she said. Brittany Carastro, 27, who has been a regular congregant for more than a year, acknowledged that she was a little nervous about coming back into contact with others but felt confident that the church had taken all appropriate measures to keep people safe, and so she had decided to return. “They are going against what the governor has said but at the same time, I’m going to come in and support my church,” she said before the service. No sign of police By 10:30 a.m. Sunday, the scheduled time for the service to start, there were no police on the premises, indicating that the orders were not being enforced there. The police also stayed away from Millville’s New Life Church which also reopened for an indoor service for the first time on Sunday. Pastor Richard Myers said before the event that he had decided to reopen for inside services despite the executive orders mostly because his community is suffering from the effects of more than two months of lockdown. Credit: Jon Hurdle Prolonged isolation is producing more divorce, depression, domestic violence and even post-traumatic stress disorder, Myers said, and that’s why people need to come back to church. “That’s the reason why it’s time to open for us,” he said. “It’s the oath of my ordination to take care of the people that have been assigned to me.” To guard against any resurgent infection, the musicians in New Life Church, which attracted around 300 people to services before the pandemic, would be about 30 feet away from the nearest congregant, while Myers himself was planning to be at least 10 feet away from attendees, he said. Details of the lawsuits Meanwhile, the two churches are joining with Cornerstone Community Church, also in Millville, and House of Praise in Swedesboro in seeking a court order to declare that the executive orders on church operation are unconstitutional. Their suit, filed in federal court in Camden on May 22, accuses Murphy, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan of violating the rights of religion, speech, assembly, due process and equal protection under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution by maintaining the restrictions on religious services. It says the 10-person limit for indoor gathering effectively bans all but the “tiniest” religious services, and it accused the defendants of imposing tighter restrictions on religious communities than on some other institutions. “Defendants’ granting of numerous special exemptions to their bans on public gatherings, and inclusion of purportedly ‘essential’ businesses and activities provided that social distancing practices are observed, demonstrates that defendants will consider less-restrictive means to further their purported government interest than those employed with respect to religion,” the suit says. U.S. District Judge Robert Kugler set an online hearing on June 4 for the defendants to argue why a preliminary injunction against the restrictions on religious gatherings should not be granted. The Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the suit. In a separate suit filed in federal court in Trenton on May 29, 27 churches asked a judge to rule that religious institutions are just as essential as the businesses like grocery stores and pharmacies that have been allowed to remain open during the pandemic because of that designation. “He has chosen to keep open the liquor stores and abortion clinics, calling them essential as he has governed this crisis, yet has chosen to keep houses of worship closed,” said plaintiff pastor Walter Nistorenko of the Abundant Life Church in Ocean View, referring to Murphy. “We know that churches are beyond essential.”",0.0
1622579334,2020-06-01 12:49:30,'Today is Atlantic City at it's worst' mayor says about looting,https://wobm.com/today-is-atlantic-city-at-its-worst-mayor-says-about-looting/,en,False,,442196,wobm.com,http://wobm.com/,"ATLANTIC CITY — An angry Mayor Marty Small laid some of the blame for Sunday night's looting and violence at the feet of Atlantic City's citizens, but said the shopping area vandalized will reopen. After a peaceful demonstration and march on the boardwalk Sunday afternoon, looters began smashing windows at the Tanger Outlets Atlantic City shopping area during the early evening along three blocks of Baltic Avenue. ""The city of Atlantic City was under siege yesterday,"" Small said during a media briefing at the outlet center where volunteers reported to help clean up. The mayor said a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will be in effect daily until June 8. A curfew was put into effect on Sunday night by police right after the looting. Small said of the 17 people arrested during the looting, only six were from Atlantic City, with the others from both ""out of state"" and from other New Jersey municipalities but he did not specify from where. The mayor also did not say what those who were arrested were charged with or if they were being held. Atlantic City police spokesman Kevin Fair told New Jersey 101.5 200 to 300 people were protesting on Sunday night. Fair said he was was preparing a statement about the arrests for release on Monday afternoon. Small said he spoke with Steve Tanger, CEO of Tanger Outlets, who said he was disappointed at the protests but assured him that repairs will be made to the 20 damaged stores and the center will reopen. ""He said 'Mayor, we gotta work together to build this back up. And I pledge our 100% full support,'"" Small said. Non-essential retail stores, including the Outlet's 70 stores, have been closed in New Jersey by executive order by Gov. Phil Murphy to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Some of the stores lost their entire inventory, Small said Tanger told him. He noted that surveillance video was operating in the stores during the looting. The All Wars Memorial Building, also called the Soliders Home, was also vandalized, according to Small, with food and supplies stolen that were to be used for the preparation of hot meals for nearly 4,000 seniors twice a week. Sixty State Police troopers reported to Atlantic City on Sunday night and another 50 came in Monday, according to the mayor. He said he would consider bringing in the National Guard if looting and protests were to continue. ""All options are on the table,"" Small said when asked if he would consider bringing in National Guard troops. He said Gov. Phil Murphy has pledged whatever the city needs to clean up after the vandalism. During a late-night media briefing the mayor held hours after the looting, Small said he was ""pissed"" and disappointed at the behavior and the ""embarrassment"" it brought to the city he was was ready to reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic. Murphy hinted that casinos may reopen in time for the July 4 holiday during an interview with Atlantic City radio station WOND, according to NJ.com coverage of the interview. ""It's unacceptable, it's unfortunate and it's sad that we as a city let some outsiders come in and trash our town, destroy our businesses while all the Atlantic City people who participated let it happen,"" Small said Sunday night, He was especially upset at people who did Facebook Live broadcasts instead of trying to stop it. ""This is our city. And only things like this happen in Atlantic City because we let it happen. And it's a damn shame. Everybody should be disappointed. It's hurtful,"" Small said. ""Today is Atlantic City at it's worst,"" Small said. The Atlantic City Expressway, which was also closed in both directions at Atlantic Avenue, was reopened on Monday morning.

By 8:00 a.m. Sunday, fresh from a power wash, the statue gleamed. It would soon be encircled by a dense blockade of more than 50 police officers and Pennsylvania state troopers—an extravagant use of taxpayer dollars, as some pointed out—a monumental statement refreshed, a projection of Philadelphia’s municipal priorities for restoring an image of order. As Queen Muse put it in an op-ed for Philadelphia Magazine calling for the immediate removal of the statue, “Whether the decision was intentional or haphazard, by rushing to have the Rizzo statue cleaned this weekend, Kenney sent a message to marginalized residents of this city that the issues that undergird their pain are not important to him.” Yesterday morning, I scrolled through my social media feeds and expressions of distress and dismay that the heart of our city, and cities across the country, had been torn to pieces. It is hard to see a place you love smashed up, bruised, burned. But it is unbearable to see Black fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters brutalized and killed by police on what feels like a never-ending loop, reduced to pixels and funneled straight into our most personal of devices, week upon week, month upon month, and year upon year. It goes without saying: damage to buildings is repairable, the murder and psychological torment inflicted by police brutality is not. As someone working in the field of historic preservation, I’m used to seeing—and am occasionally criticized for—posts that overemphasize buildings, affirming their importance, mourning their ongoing or imminent destruction. Windows were smashed, walls were tagged, and structures were burned this weekend, but this moment is not about buildings. This moment in time demands of us a more critical reflection. As we sweep up the glass, and assess the damage, we must reflect on what our environments—buildings, statues, and public spaces—symbolize, who they include and exclude, and what values they convey. In protests across the country this weekend, we saw anger directed at police precincts, corporate stores, government buildings, and unequivocal monuments to racism, like the Market House in Fayettville—where human beings were bought and sold—the headquarters of the Daughters of the Confederacy in Richmond, and here, the monument to a racist, bigoted former mayor that looms from Thomas Paine Plaza, a historical site of protest, and salutes City Hall. We need to take this as a moment to reflect on the legacy of racism in our country, the narratives and values that are embodied in architecture and monuments, and why they are being challenged right now. We need to remember how political uprisings in the past have brought about change. Part of what’s being communicated through this unrest is the fact that the current way of operating is disproportionately and violently harming Black Americans and people of color. This violence takes the form of police brutality, as it did this month for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, but also manifests in lack of access to healthcare, disinvestment, predatory lending, poverty wages and income gaps, homelessness, ICE raids, and inhumane immigration policies. We can sweep up broken glass and restore the facades in Center City, but that doesn’t change the fact that during the 1950s and 60s, Philadelphia and other urban centers were left completely defunded and neglected during white flight, or that in the ensuing decades they have been taken back over, gentrified and tidied for a white audience, their spaces policed accordingly. “We are using the police force to protect a white icon when there are not police protecting black and brown families in this moment. @ddroyster https://t.co/BE7uSea9rm @FIAnational @powerinterfaith — Bishop Dwayne Royster (@ddroyster) May 31, 2020 Our cities and environments are shaped by prevailing value systems, by systems of power. And preservation—what we deem valuable and the “official” narratives we attach to it—is indelibly connected. Fixating on buildings at this moment is inappropriate. It’s not about restoring facades and restoring normalcy. We need to think about what these historic events say about where we are as a society. We need to work inclusively to rebuild our cities and institutions so that they work for all of us. Just as preservation recognizes that buildings embody and convey cultural values, it should recognize this kind of damage to them for what it is: the rightfully furious and desperate backlash to the failure of our system to recognize the humanity of all of our fellow citizens. Recognition matters. Interpretation matters. Who controls the narrative matters. How far would the resources that have been put towards protecting the statue of a racist go towards preserving sites related to Black history? Rasheda Phillips, creator of AfroFuturist Affair/Black Quantum Futurism and Community Futures Lab, pointed out the pattern of hand-off neglect that has defined much of the city’s approach to Black history to date. “They’re so worried about property but won’t protect the John Coltrane house, Dox Thrash house, the Checker club or any number of historical Black properties and monuments destroyed by the violence of developers and city neglect.” They’re so worried about property but won’t protect the John Coltrane house, Dox Thrash house, the Checker club or any number of historical Black properties and monuments destroyed by the violence of developers and city neglect. How does that work? — RP (@RPhillipsEsq) May 31, 2020 How can we progress from here? From a preservation and cultural heritage standpoint, there’s a lot of work to do. First, we need to reckon with the fact that the movement, particularly in Philadelphia, is overwhelmingly white. It shouldn’t be. Both formal preservation education and local advocacy efforts have to become more inclusive, accessible, and relevant. We can also ease back on the obsession with architectural purity, which favors high style architecture, wealthier neighborhoods, and places unnecessary burdens on lower income households and owners by imposing strict guidelines and review processes. We have to work to expand the basic criteria used to recognize places as important, which emphasize connections to important historical events, architects, and people, reinforcing all of the usual (white and male) historical biases. We need to come up with ways to recognize spaces that aren’t buildings, local institutions, buildings less than 50 years old, and places that undergo frequent change in order to survive. We need to include different narratives, invite new authors, and figure out how to communicate different stories in unexpected places, recognizing that there are far too few sites of “achievement” and “progress” and the sort of superlative, feel-good stories that we’re used to that represent all classes, races, genders, or sexual orientation. Intersecting identities have always informed who is and isn’t able to contribute, whose contributions are recognized, and whose are given credibility.",0.0

The good news: You won’t automatically get put in handcuffs for heading to vote after 6 p.m. should the city extend its nightly lockdown into Tuesday. “Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,” said District Attorney Larry Krasner. “No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you.” City Commissioner Lisa Deeley said her office is developing a contingency plan in the event that access to polling places — already reduced by nearly 80% by the pandemic — is hindered by ongoing protests or looting. That plan could involve relocating a polling location or funneling voters to another location, though details were scarce. A steep decline had long been expected for in-person voter turnout, even prior to the protests over police brutality and institutional racism. More than 1.8 million Pennsylvanians have been approved for mail-in ballots. The city’s top prosecutor said he didn’t think the unlawful activity would interfere with voters who still plan to vote in person. “Philadelphia is a tough city,” Krasner said. “I don’t think any of the looters out there are trying to steal votes. I think they’re trying to steal clothes.” But officials will still be carefully monitoring, watching for the usual array of voting concerns.",0.0

ALBANY — The thousands of protesters in close proximity in New York, which has been the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, could fuel another surge of the virus' spread, Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned Monday. The protests to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis has led to massive protests across New York in recent days, particularly in New York City, and comes as the state has successfully lowered the infection rate from COVID-19. But the density of people has Cuomo worried that as the coronavirus death toll drops to its lowest point since the pandemic struck in late March, it could see a resurgence due to the protests. ""We don’t even know the consequence for the COVID virus of those mass gatherings,"" Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus briefing Monday. ""We don’t even know. We won’t know, possibly for weeks, the nature of the virus. How many super spreaders were in the crowd?"" The Democratic governor again urged against the violence, looting and clashing with police that has marred the peaceful protests across New York and the nation. He knocked some of the police's actions as ""disturbing,"" but also criticized the criminal actions by some of those in the crowd. ""The people who are exploiting the situation — the looting, that’s not protesting,"" Cuomo said. ""That’s not righteous indignation. That’s criminality, and it plays into the hands of the people and the forces that don’t want to make the changes in the first place. Because they get to dismiss the entire effort."" New York has been the national epicenter for COVID-19, with 24,000 deaths and 372,000 positive cases, mainly in New York City and its suburbs. But the rate of infection has slowed to its lowest point in more than two months, the result of social distancing and a shut down of all non-essential businesses since March 22. The number of daily deaths Sunday fell to 54 after hitting as many as 800 deaths a day in early April. The economy started to reopen May 15, when five upstate regions entered Phase 1 of a four-phase reopening plan. Now those regions, including the Southern Tier, Finger Lakes and central New York, are in Phase 2 and the Hudson Valley is in Phase 1. New York City is expected to enter Phase 1 on June 8, but Cuomo said he's concerned about the reopening of the city after the violent nature of the protests. ""It reduces the credibility of the protests in the first place,"" he said. ""It will allow the critics to now say they are all criminals and try to color the whole protest with the looting, to change the image from the real issue, which was Mr. Floyd’s death."" Cuomo said the protests are at least happening when the COVID-19 infection rate is at its lowest level since the pandemic struck, as well as the protesters being fairly young and many wearing masks, which he called ""a cruel irony."" Only about 1,000 of the 50,000 coronavirus tests administered Sunday came back positive, he said. ""If that happened 60 days ago, forget it – because more people would have been infected,"" Cuomo said. State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker encouraged protesters to wear masks, bring hand sanitizer and social distance as much as possible. The governor urged protesters to push for positive change. He laid out his own agenda: a national ban on excessive police force and chokeholds; independent investigations of police abuse; disclosure of disciplinary records of police officers under investigation; and a national plan on poverty, education funding equity and affordable housing. Releasing disciplinary records of police has long been a debate in New York, but has been successfully fought by police unions.

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

""You have to arrest people."" Using blunt language, Trump said that ""radicals"" and ""anarchists"" are behind the unrest, and he urged governors to crack down on them. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the Monday call, told governors they have to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds, and urged them to “go after troublemakers.” Trump's remarks to the governors followed a sixth day of clashes Sunday between police and protesters in cities across the nation that erupted in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis. The latest:George Floyd protest live updates: Prison riot teams deployed to DC; police cars burn in NYC; thousands arrested across US More than 4,400 arrests have been made at demonstrations nationwide since video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd can be heard saying ""I can't breathe."" Trump told the governors that he is beefing up police presence in Washington. ""Washington was under very good control, but we're going to have it under much more control,"" Trump said. ""We're going to pull in thousands of people. ... We're going to clamp down very, very strong."" He added: “You have to arrest people. You have to try people. You have to put them in jail for 10 years, and you’ll never see this stuff again. And you have to let them know that.” Crisis leadership:Consoler in chief or confronter in chief? Combination of crises tests Trump's leadership: Analysis Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a call with four big-city mayors Monday afternoon, sounded a different note when addressing the past days of unrest. Biden spoke out against the violence and “needless destruction” of property, saying it’s “no way forward” and will drive people away from a just cause. But he also said there’s justifiable public outrage. “It’s got to be incredibly difficult finding the balance between keeping people safe, protecting public space while acknowledging the incredible plain and legitimate anger that is the root of these protests,” Biden said during a video chat with the Democratic mayors of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti accused the Trump administration of pushing the nation back to “20th century policing” and said mayors are having to figure things out for themselves because of a lack of national leadership. “We need some morality. We need some leadership,” Garcetti said. “I would love for this president to speak to this nation to say 'Maybe it was wrong when I said that, our law enforcement officers, a few years ago, shouldn’t worry about people’s heads when they’re putting them into police cars.’” Hunkered down:Trump briefly taken to underground bunker as protests grew outside White House",0.0

Asbury Park Press Gov. Phil Murphy expressed support on Monday to demonstrators gathering in cities across New Jersey and nationwide to protest police brutality and systemic racism following the death of George Floyd. Murphy called the demonstrations ""a transformational moment in our time"" and said they should be a catalyst to address long-standing economic and social inequality in the state and across the country. Gov Phil Murphy at the daily briefing in Trenton, May 13, 2020 (Photo: Pool Photo) ""I support these protests and I thank the thousands of residents who peacefully and respectfully took part,"" Murphy said at the start of a news conference in Trenton otherwise focused on the coronavirus pandemic. ""I know the pain associated with this movement is real and is representative of a society that has been largely unresponsive to calls for change and equal justice from black and brown communities."" Demonstrators gathered in more than 30 cities and towns across New Jersey over the weekend, officials said, part of a wave of anger and frustration that has swept across the country in the wake of a death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis last week. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death after a video emerged showing the officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd's death has become the latest flashpoint in a long history of African-Americans dying in encounters with police. Murphy said he was ""moved to see communities throughout our state big and small stand up and lie down for what they believe."" He highlighted Camden Police Joseph Wysocki who joined with demonstrators Saturday and helped to carry a protest banner in a moment that made national headlines. ""The fact that so many came forward in peace and common ground to fight for the most basic principal of human dignity is a powerful reminder of the black and brown experience in America today,"" Murphy said. ""The fact that so many others who do not live this reality would join them, making these protests powerful displays of our great diversity, should be of a point of pride for our state."" ""People with privilege are now recognizing the pain of those without,"" he added. Murphy said acknowledged the ""insidious affects of racism"" are not new to New Jersey and said the state must ""listen and act"" on activists demands to address inequality in everything from economic opportunity to health disparities and education. ""The pain of yesterday and the pain of today does not have to be the pain of tomorrow,"" he said. State Police Col. Patrick Callahan said the vast majority of the demonstrations in New Jersey were peaceful, but two on Sunday devolved into looting and destruction of property. Civil unrest resulted in 27 arrests in Trenton and 12 in Atlantic City, mainly on criminal mischief charges, Callahan said.

Several hundred peaceful protesters marched from Pier Village to the steps of the Long Branch Police Department. Sunday, May 31, 2020 photo/James J. Connolly/Correspondent (Photo: James J. Connolly) Murphy condemned the ""vast minority"" who participated in the violence. ""I view those as attacks on our communities,"" he said. ""It's not just a window. It's not just a door. A community is a living thing."" But he said the disorder in Trenton and Atlantic City should not ""distract from the greater message lifted up by literally tens of thousands of others."" Murphy resisted calls to bring in the National Guard to maintain order, a measure governors in at least 24 states have taken, saying state and local law enforcement had control of the situation. Responding to questions about whether the protests could worsen the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, Murphy said demonstrators should wear masks and be mindful of their health, but the demonstrators had a right to gather. Officials have for months pleaded with residents to avoid crowds and issued summonses to some who organized protests against the state's emergency orders. ""It's one thing to protest what day nail salons are opening and it's another thing to come out and peacefully protest, overwhelmingly, about someone who was murdered right before our eyes,"" he said.

We come in peace! We know not all cops are bad,” said Perkins, who helped organize the rally. “But if there is no reform, there can be no peace.” In the crowd, some people agreed with Perkins about this question of peace.

Only one man in the crowd wore a suit. This was Jim Shea, Jersey City’s director of public safety. Shea is tall — several inches above 6 feet. Every few minutes he stood on the tiptoes of his black dress shoes and scanned the back of the crowd, which numbered 600 people. Shea was looking for trouble. He saw none. When Perkins finished his speech, he handed off the bullhorn and walked over to Shea. “Just make eye contact with me when you want to go,” Shea told the activist. “That way we can get organized. I don’t want a car to come through the crowd.” Story continues below gallery The protest against police violence in Jersey City on Monday afternoon was like this, a delicate balance between cheerfulness and rage. This time, peace won handily. But the rage was there, running like an underground river, and Nevins and Shea and the protesters and all the police officers in their black riot gear knew it. As they marched, protesters and police officers hugged. Other protesters handed out surgical masks to people who had none. Clarence Collins walked up Bramhall Avenue with the first of the protesters, chanting “No justice, no peace!” Approaching a police officer, he paused and reached out his fist. Collins and the cop gently tapped knuckles. “How you doin', Coach C?” said the cop. “What do you say, Papi?” Collins called back. “Jersey City cops are decent. They’re not all buttholes,” said Collins, who works as a life skills coach at University Academy Charter School in Jersey City. “Everybody wants to come home safe. But the video we saw of police killing George Floyd was outright murder.” A balance between anger and peace One protester offered a mask to Gail Albright, who sat on a folding chair on the sidewalk and watched the march go by. Albright smiled and thanked him. Then she frowned. ""I hate Jersey City,” Albright said. “I have real bad asthma. But if I had an electric scooter, I’d be right out there marching.

I haven’t seen anything like this on CNN,” said Andre Morris, a Jersey City resident. “It was peaceful. Nothing got looted, nothing got rioted.” Speeches over, Perkins laid his bullhorn on the sidewalk. He locked eyes with Shea. The safety director caught the signal.

Police officers raced ahead in SUVs, blocking traffic for the people to pass. Following the crowd, Shanelle Smith walked beside her son Duke, 15. She worries someone will kill him, she said. Maybe it will be another black teenager, traumatized by violence and poverty. Maybe it will be a police officer. “The cops are the biggest gang.

Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki, who has been working in the city for decades, joined the front line of a march in Camden on Saturday afternoon, sporting his uniform, a protective face mask and a peace sign. ”Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,” Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Since Camden’s police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It’s not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. Advertisement “We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,” Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd’s death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed, and items were stolen; police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media.

For the most part, they have expressed condolences for the tragic incident and offered donations to national groups doing the hard work of dismantling racist systems. Google CEO Sundar Pichai was the first to order a company-level response. On Friday, he wrote a company memo announcing an internal campaign to raise funds for organizations supporting racial justice. He also promised that Google would match any employee contribution up to $10,000. Facebook and Apple quickly followed suit by pledging to support racial justice groups and match employee donations. Facebook said it would donate $10 million to organizations recommended by employees and the company’s “civil rights advisors.” And Apple has pledged to match employee contribution two-for-one in the month of June to support several social groups. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Zuckerberg praised Darnella Frazier, who recorded and posted the video of Floyd’s death on Facebook, saying that, “as hard as it was to watch, we all needed to see that.” Apple’s Cook wrote in a company memo on Monday, calling employees to reflect on America’s painful history of racism and inequality. Even Elon Musk, who was occupied with SpaceX’s NASA launch for the most of last week, found time to engage in a timely Twitter conversation on Monday about Floyd and tweeted “#JusticeForGeorge.” Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2020 Jeff Bezos, although yet to make a statement through Amazon, shared an essay by the writer Shenequa Golding about the difficulty of maintaining professionalism while witnessing Black death on Instagram on Saturday. “The pain and emotional trauma caused by the racism and violence we are witnessing toward the Black community has a long reach,” Bezos wrote. “I recommend you take a moment to read this powerful essay, especially if you are a manager or leader.” On Monday, Amazon’s official Twitter account posted a statement that read, “The inequitable and brutal treatment of Black people in our country must stop. Together we stand in solidarity with the Black community—our employees, customers, and partners—in the fight against systematic racism and injustice.” However, watchdogs were quick to call out what they called Amazon’s hypocrisy. “Funny coming from the company that fired a Black man for asking for safer working conditions during [COVID-19], sells Nazi flags and remains the last large advertiser on Breitbart, which once featured a ‘Black Crime’ section, despite being asked to stop by 600+ of your diverse workers,” replied Sleep Giants, a liberal social media activism group, under Amazon’s tweet. Other companies’ gesture of sympathy faced similar blowback. Zuckerberg’s message, for example, “seems to have the opposite effect that was intended,” wrote New York Times tech reporter Mike Issac, “as insiders saw Facebook executives throwing money at the problem.” Also on Monday, a group of Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout to protest Zuckerberg’s decision last week to keep President Donald Trump’s inflammatory posts advocating for violence against black demonstrators on the company’s platform. “Along with Black employees in the company, and all persons with a moral conscience, I am calling for Mark to immediately take down the President’s post advocating violence, murder and imminent threat against Black people,” a Facebook employee participating in the protest wrote in an internal message board, according to The New York Times.",0.0

1622676348,2020-06-01 17:15:15,New round of protests have begun in Philly,https://whyy.org/articles/new-round-of-protests-have-begun-in-philly/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"A large protest against police brutality that flooded parts of Center City Monday mostly dispersed as night began to fall on Philadelphia’s third day of demonstrations denouncing the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. Tensions reached a peak when the group blocked traffic in both directions of I-676. State Troopers intervened, releasing multiple tear gas canisters into the crowd as part of its effort to clear people off the expressway. Catherine Letine, 30, was among those marching. “It’s been mostly peaceful and the police were the first to strike on us,” said Letine, a life-long Philadelphian who is white. “We have no weapons. We’re unarmed. We’re here peacefully and they have continued to use force. And it will only get worse I’m sure.” State Police, in a statement to NBC10, said tear gas was used because some protesters pelted police with rocks and bottles. Protesters rapidly disbursed, heading off the highway back towards 22nd Street and scattering in multiple directions. Dozens of protesters, some lined up against a median on the highway, were detained by police. The tense situation led to the shutdown of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in both directions. Throughout the day, helicopters whirred above, with people holding signs with messages such as “black lives matter” and “defund the police.” As of 6 p.m., Philadelphia is under a mandatory citywide curfew. It will not lift until 6 a.m. Tuesday. During those hours, people can only leave their homes to go to work at essential businesses or to seek medical attention or police assistance. The larger unrest hit cities across the country after Floyd died when being arrested and restrained by Minneapolis police for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. Officer Derek Chauvin was seen on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes. Chauvin, who had previously faced more than 15 conduct complaints, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder. Three other officers part of the altercation have also been fired. Saturday and Sunday both featured large, mostly peaceful protests during the day, followed by vandalism, property damage and looting in the afternoon and evening. Each day has seen moments of both harmony and extreme tension between protesters and police. On Monday, some police officers knelt on the steps of the police headquarters in a show of solidarity. In other moments, officers have seemed to show little respect for people’s right to assemble, ramming them with bicycles and pepper spraying without provocation. On Sunday, a WHYY reporter covering a peaceful march was tackled and arrested without warning. On Monday, one protester, an African American woman who asked not to be named, said she felt “defeated” and “hurt” based on her interactions with police. “I’ve been flipped off. I’ve been told ‘Fuck you’ by these police officers…” she said. “A police officer drove by in his car and sprayed mace out of his window towards my friends. It’s very disgusting to see how they act.” Since Saturday, the first day the city implemented the mandatory curfew, officers have arrested 161 people for being on the street past 6 p.m, according to police. The vast majority were city residents. Police arrested another 257 people for failure to disperse. The majority of those people were also city residents. Trouble in Fishtown Starting in the early evening, a group of roughly a hundred people, mostly white men, patrolled Girard Avenue in Fishtown, confronting a group of protesters. Some of the men carried bats. Others had golf clubs and billy clubs. Protesters had signs. One man was overheard by a WHYY producer as saying: “I’m ready to fuck shit up. You know, I’ve been looking for a fight for the past 6 months.” Another man holding a hatchet had an angry interaction with a protester in the street. “I’m here to protect this neighborhood,” he said. One guy tells a cop: “im not here to make your job harder. I want to protect you.” A guy in a trump hat raised his fist and greeted his friend by saying “white man!” — Jon Ehrens (@jwehrens) June 1, 2020 ‘No one has listened for years’ Earlier in the day, another group of protesters gathered outside City Hall, with many calling for the removal of the Frank Rizzo statue bolted to the steps of the nearby Municipal Services Building. Barricades now cross JFK Boulevard in between MSB and City Hall, blocking access to the statue. Members of Philadelphia police department, as well as the National Guard, who were brought in to assist local police as civil unrest continued for a third day in a row, stood behind the barricade. On the outside, protesters chanted slogans and burned sage. Mayor Jim Kenney said over the weekend that the Rizzo statue will be removed more quickly than planned, likely within a month. On the opposite side of City Hall, the group Human Rights Coalition 215 held its own protest by the statue of black intellectual and activist Octavius Catto, calling for a variety of national and local reforms.",0.0

Tensions flared between police and protesters when officers in riot gear started forcefully clearing the streets after 10 p.m., two hours after the 8 p.m. curfew. Police began making arrests and some demonstrators hurled rocks at officers. One officer was injured in the melee, according to Sgt. Michael Casey, a spokesman for the Asbury Park Police Department. Police made 12 arrests, including two juveniles, Casey said. He did not immediately say what charges they were facing.

Hours earlier, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the Asbury Park Post Office outraged over Floyd's death. Protesters waved signs with phrases like ""White Silence=Violence,"" ""No Justice No Peace"" and ""I can't breathe,"" a reference to words Floyd uttered on a video showing an officer pressing a knee into his neck.

Officers, urged on by the crowd, at times took a knee in solidarity with the demonstrators. At the start of the rally, faith leaders and community activists spoke through a bullhorn on the steps of the post office — located across the street from the city's police station — denouncing Floyd's death and railing against prejudice and unequal treatment faced by African-Americans and other people of color across the country. In between speeches, demonstrators erupted in chants of ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""enough is enough"" and a call-and-response chant of ""say his name"" followed by ""George Floyd."" “We’re here to say enough is enough and start organizing to create community accountability,"" said community activist Derek Minno Bloom. ""We want justice."" Buy Photo Protesters gather in Asbury Park to demand justice for George Floyd.

Among those taken into custody was Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martínez Contreras, who was arrested despite city officials exempting members of the press from the curfew. Martínez Contreras was transported to the Belmar Police Department and issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse. He was released from police custody early Tuesday morning. Column: Arrest of APP reporter covering Asbury Park protest part of a troubling trend The protest was part of a wave of demonstrations in New Jersey and across the country set off by Floyd's death a week ago. The crowd marched following a weekend of tense confrontations between police and protesters in cities throughout the United States. Some demonstrations that began peacefully devolved into violence and looting. Floyd, 46, died May 25 in Minneapolis after police there tried to arrest him following a forgery complaint. Video of the encounter, which spread widely online, showed a white police officer pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd gasped that he couldn't breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Asbury Park officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew Monday in anticipation of the rally. Mail service to post offices in the area was suspended earlier in the afternoon.

It will remain in effect until 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. A weekend of peaceful protests and marches in Trenton ended with chaos and a curfew Sunday night. The city is now on “lockdown,” said mayor Reed Gusciora, and the 8 p.m. curfew will stay in place through June 1. Hundreds gathered in Trenton on Saturday and Sunday to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd died after Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on the neck of a subdued and handcuffed Floyd for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was unresponsive for almost three of those nine minutes.

A liquor store, a sneaker store and a PNC bank were broken into. It is unclear whether or not the protests and after-dark looting are connected. Residents and march attendees have reported a second group that gathered in the city after the protest dispersed was responsible for the violence. Gusciora mentioned “out-of-towners.” “I don’t believe looting a sneaker store or a liquor store really is productive or keeps the discussion going,” Gusciora said. “We have so many things that we need to focus on in this city, whether it be economic development or creating a better city and moving it forward.

In Asbury Park, the city imposed a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m., as throngs of people gathered for a protest at 801 Bangs Avenue in support of ""social justice and police accountability."" The crowd was sizable based on images posted to social media, including Jean Dortissant on Twitter. As of early Monday evening, the demonstration appeared to remain peaceful.

It added the curfew was ""to protect the safety of the organizers and attendees of the protest, and our residents."" Atlantic City announced its overnight curfews will remain in effect until June 8, after the arrests of 17 New Jersey residents Sunday, for what city officials said was rioting and looting following a peaceful protest. Of those arrested, 12 are residents of Atlantic County. The Atlantic City curfew begins each night at 7 p.m. At least four Mercer County communities issued stringent overnight curfews, a day after 27 people were arrested in Trenton after attempted looting and vandalism hours after peaceful events in honor of George Floyd and against systemic racism. Ewing, Hamilton Township, Lawrence Township and Trenton all set curfews of 7 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.

The crowd was sizable based on images posted to social media, including Jean Dortissant on Twitter. As of early Monday evening, the demonstration appeared to remain peaceful. City officials, including the Mayor and Council and Asbury Park Police, ""stand in full solidarity with the Asbury Park community in promotion of a peaceful demonstration and denounce the actions of the officers involved in the murder of George Floyd and any acts of police misconduct,"" the city's announcement of its curfew said.

June 1, 2020. Vineland Daily Journal VINELAND – “Say his name,” chanted about 75 protesters who marched through downtown on Monday, demanding justice for George Floyd, the black man whose death in police custody has sparked national outrage. Reaching Landis Park, the crowd, that included acting Police Chief Pedro Casiano and half-dozen police officers, knelt for eight minutes to observe the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held his knee to the neck of Floyd, who was face-down and handcuffed. Protest organizers, Tahira Davis and Mia Arbona, childhood friends who are now college students, said they were looking add their voices to an area protest when they opted to pursue something more personal. “Why wait, we can do it ourselves,” Arbona said. On Sunday night, they turned to social media to invite the public to join them. About 1 p.m., cars pulled up to the designated Landis Avenue meeting spot and the sign-carrying crowd swelled. “This whole thing has really hit a nerve; we can’t sit back and just repost and tweet as much as we can, we have to take action,” Arbona said. Many carried ""Black lives matter"" and ""Enough is Enough"" posters. “You can feel it in the air, something’s different,” Davis said, “Before there would be a death, and then social media would go crazy for a little bit, and then it would die down.” The goal of their march “is to make sure that people know that no matter what color you are, you are accepted and that nobody deserves to be abused or killed or racially profiled,” Arbona told The Daily Journal. “We don’t want any more black people to leave their houses fearing for their lives.” Vineland police escorted the procession to ensure their safe passage to the park. Casiano and about a half-dozen officers walked alongside the chanting protesters.

Casiano and other police officers walked alongside the protesters during the march. June 1, 2020 (Photo: Deborah M. Marko) “We want the community to know that we are part of this community too,” Casiano said. Justin Young, 21, of Vineland, said he felt compelled to participate in the march “as soon as I heard about it.” Like Reps. John Lewis and the late Elijah Cummings, Young is a member of the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. “They have been a part of the civil rights movement, I want to continue that legacy in my town,” Young said. “This is just the first step, I believe it’s not just about protesting or just about talking, the conservation started decades before any of us were born,” he said. “We need to become more involved in our community,” Young said, calling upon the public to hold their elected leaders accountable. Jaiden Santiago, 12, of Vineland, carried his sketch of George Floyd during a peaceful protest June 1 in Vineland. (Photo: Deborah M. Marko) While marchers shouted Floyd’s name, 12-year-old artist Jaiden Santiago held up a portrait. The youngster sketched Floyd’s portrait which he framed with the words ""Justice for Floyd."" “We have a lot of black family members, and they are all important to me,” the youngster said when asked why he participated in the march. As the protest concluded, Arbona thanked the crowd, and the police, for their support. “Our job is not done, our job doesn’t end here with the protest today,” she said, noting another group is reportedly planning another protest in the city later this week. “We hope to see you guys there again,” she said. Safety Director Edwin Alicea was among those at the Landis Park observance and added his support to the protesters. “We support their views in reference to the injustice that was done in Minneapolis,” Alicea said. During a peaceful protest in Vineland, participants knelt for eight minutes, signifying the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held his knee on George Floyd's neck. (Photo: Deborah M. Marko) “I don’t know of any officer, any agency, anywhere that I can think of that would condone the actions of those officers there,” Alicea said. “By no means, do we condone such activity.” Supporting and attending the march was a step toward bringing the community together, he said. “They need to know that we are here for them, that they can come and talk to us,” Alicea said. “They can come and ask for help, they don’t need to fear us."" ""They need to know that we here at their service, and the only way we can fix a situation is by communicating with each other,"" Alicea said. Deborah M.

NorthJersey.com A retired Clifton deputy fire chief who posted incendiary comments on Facebook regarding George Floyd protests has done damage to the city, officials said. ""If you are out at any of these 'protest' you are a scum bag and deserve to get shot,"" read a post Monday by Norm Tahan, who retired in 2014 but used a photo of himself in uniform as a profile image. That post and others by Tahan were shared on social media by users who urged people to contact the city of Clifton to lodge complaints. City Manager Nick Villano said he spent all day fielding phone calls and answering emails. He said he had received complaints from all over Passaic and Bergen counties, the state of New Jersey and former fire officials. A Twitter user responding to a Facebook post by former Clifton Deputy Fire Chief Norm Tahan. (Photo: NorthJersey.com) Villano said what Tahan does now is his own business, but added, ""Don't wear the uniform that you took off six years ago.""

""What he said was unwarranted, especially now,"" Villano said. Fire Chief Frank Prezioso took it further. ""Comments like this are a danger to the Fire Department,"" he said. ""They jeopardize the lives of firemen."" George Tahan on Facebook (Photo: Facebook post) He, too, said he had been fielding emails since the post appeared, and was continuing to do so late into Monday evening. ""I am aggravated,"" he said. ""It's unacceptable behavior."" Tahan could not be reached for comment, but in a subsequent post on Facebook he tried to clarify his position: ""I was in NO WAY, saying that a peaceful march, or protest, whatever you want to call it, is bad or you are bad for attending. So I apologize for those who did not get it, but I understand how some did not. A sit down to discuss is always welcome."" In 2009, a group of about 10 residents protested outside City Hall after Tahan's promotion to deputy fire chief. They pointed to comments he had made in the past that they deemed racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim. Sometimes-violent protests have erupted nationwide over the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Dozens of cities have imposed curfews in an effort to restore order.

So why did Camden, a majority-minority city where riots in 1969 and 1971 accelerated the blight, crime and poverty which challenge it still, remain peaceful as cities from Los Angeles to New York, Minneapolis to Atlanta, have seen chaos and anger spill over? How it began Yolanda Deaver, a mother of three sons, already knew the unfathomable pain of losing a child. Her oldest died three years ago from leukemia at just 15. When she saw the video of George Floyd's life and breath being squeezed from him, as she heard him call out for his own mother, her thoughts went to her surviving sons, ages 13 and 4. ""It weighed heavily on me,"" she said. ""I thought about my sons; I am trying to raise them to be successful, smart, respectful young men, and I hate for them to go through any racial profiling."" Deaver, who owns Prissy Chic Hair Company, a salon and beauty supply on Mount Ephraim Avenue in Camden, ""had a feeling in my heart that I had to do something."" She mulled going to Minneapolis but worried it might be dangerous; instead, she posted her intention to march from her salon to the Camden County Police Department building at Haddon Avenue and Federal Street. Shortly after posting her plan, a friend who is also a Camden County police officer asked if she could join, telling Deaver, ""even though I am a police officer, I feel the same way you do."" Deaver's reply: ""As long as we march in solidarity."" Soon, more police officers asked to join. By Saturday morning, the police chief was standing with Deaver, holding a banner and joining her in a ""Black Lives Matter"" chant. Different department, different emphasis The Camden County Police Department formed in 2013 in the aftermath of a city financial crisis that prompted mass layoffs within the existing Camden City Police Department. In 2012, with a decimated police force, the city set a grim milestone with a record high 67 homicides. The new, county-run department, initially led by Chief J. Scott Thomson, hired some of the city officers and recruited new officers. Thomson began his career with the city department and rose through its ranks to become its youngest chief. With the newly-formed department, he placed an emphasis on community policing, drawing national attention and presidential praise. Buy Photo President Barack Obama gestures towards the crowd prior to speaking at the Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center in Camden on Monday. (Photo: Chris LaChall/Courier-Post) Thomson retired last year, and Joe Wysocki, who'd served as his second-in-command since 2016, took over, intent on continuing and expanding upon Thomson's emphasis on engagement. The department has not been without its critics. There were initial charges of union busting (officers are now members of a local Fraternal Order of Police) and worries that bringing recruits from outside the city — many of them young and inexperienced in urban policing — would soon abandon Camden for more lucrative jobs with suburban departments. The county-run department led many city activists to cry foul, saying the county was imposing the change upon disenfranchised residents. Vida Neil, a city resident and activist, called it a ""rogue police force."" ""Their idea of community policing is to set up a barbecue grill and pull up an ice cream truck,"" said Neil, who lives in the city's Morgan Village section. ""But whatever happened to foot patrols? Whatever happened to cops who know residents, and walk the streets? They don't even respond to calls."" Singling out officers who remained from the city force — Neil is a retired Public Works employee whose last job was at the department's headquarters — she said that ""some of the new officers aren't trained right and they're not getting socialized. The young white ones were raised with the dangers of Camden, and they're just thrown into this."" County spokesman Dan Keashen said the department is now 54 percent minority, in a city that is 42 percent African American, 50.3 percent Hispanic and 21.9 percent white, according to 2019 U.S. Census estimates. Many in the city believe the department should hire more minorities to better reflect those they are policing. Wysocki, speaking to the Courier-Post Monday, said he ""can't say we're perfect."" ""To be honest, I agree with their complaint,"" said the chief. ""I 100 percent support them, but my hands are tied"" by state Civil Service requirements on hiring. He said he's spoken with state legislators representing Camden to loosen requirements so the department can hire more city residents. ""To the naysayers, I would say that's seven years ago,"" said Wysocki. ""Get to know us. I am happy to sit down and talk to anyone who wants to talk with us. Communities and police have to work together. Give us a chance."" Marching in Camden ""We didn't want to destroy our neighborhood,"" said Tawanda Jones, a city resident and founder of Camden Sophisticated Sisters, a dance and drill team that places academic and community service requirements on its members. The march was Deaver's vision, Jones said, but as more people reached out to participate, concern began to grow about keeping it orderly. ""There was a fear of outsiders coming in to riot in our city,"" said Rev. Levi Combs III of First Refuge Progressive Baptist Church in Camden. ""Our focus was to make sure this was in memory of George Floyd."" ""What was in the back of my mind was helping people understand why we as African Americans are frustrated with the system. My perspective as a minister and someone educated in the city was more about ensuring our people were safe (from COVID-19), how to not spread the virus, make sure we did this in a safe manner, and sending the message that Camden is not what it is perceived to be."" Deaver, who moved from Camden to Sicklerville three years ago, said, ""I know it's a rough city. I have friends who were murdered in the city, and it's a rough city to have police come and march with us."" Yolanda Deaver, right, talks to U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (left) and Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki at a march in memory of George Floyd in Camden on Saturday. (Photo: Courtesy Yolanda Deaver) ""Tensions are so high with the death of George Floyd,"" said Wysocki, ""it's horrible, what happened to him is just horrible, and I thought, I have got to go. So I asked the clergy if I could go and they said yes."" Wysocki and Deaver were introduced Saturday before the march. ""It was an honor (to participate),"" he said. He asked, he said, ""because this was her march. I was learning from her."" At one point, Deaver said, she yelled, ""Black lives matter!,"" but turned to Wysocki, who is white, worried he might be upset. ""But I understood,"" he said. ""That's what we were there for. People were able to voice their frustration at the Police Administration Building"" — with policing in Camden and all over — ""and I am glad they did. This was all about the community and I'm honored they let us be part of it."" ""What I will give credit to (Wysocki) for is, he is willing to come to the people,"" said Combs. ""He does not want a riot on his hands. He wants community policing and he wants them engaged, and he's admitted there have been problems."" The department, Combs said, needs more minority officers; complaints of disenfranchisement are valid, he said. ""Residents feel that they don't have any power or influence over their police department and don't have a say in how they police the city. Some feel they are profiled and marginalized. People want to see diversity in law enforcement. ""These were the cries of the people in the march and I believe the chief sees that."" Ugliness across the river As the march ended in Camden, peace settled over the city on a mild late spring Saturday. But in Philadelphia, what began as a peaceful assembly at the Philadelphia Museum of Art dissipated as some protesters marched back to City Hall and north on Broad Street. By nightfall, the city was engulfed in chaos, flames, rioting and looting. The Delaware River Port Authority kept its PATCO Hi-Speedline trains out of the city; the Benjamin Franklin Bridge was closed to vehicle and foot traffic and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney imposed a curfew before ordering all retail businesses within the city to closed. From Camden, residents could see the black smoke rising, and at night they could hear the sounds of unrest. ""As we were on our march, my phone started going off like crazy,"" said Jones. ""I have some babies in Philadelphia and I told them to stay in the house, don't go outside. One was stuck in the city and I was on my GPS trying to help her get out."" She called Philadelphia's violence ""so disheartening."" She believes the many peaceful protesters from earlier in the day went home and people from outside the city instigated the violence. ""People are desperate; some of them are in it for the cause and some were just out there to see what they could get. Some people were just in survival mode."" Combs agreed the rioting ""is not a black thing. I see white instigation. We need to be fair: What saddens me as I see it unfold (for a third day Monday) is it's only one-sided (in media portrayals). What's being done is in equal share in my opinion; it's white instigation and agitation and it's blacks looting and rioting, but this is not what we do in our culture and our community. This is not common, but this is a narrative in the media, that only blacks loot and riot."" ""My heart went out to,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner (Danielle Outlaw, said Wysocki. She came to the city from Portland and within weeks the city, like the entire country, found itself in the midst of a global pandemic. ""She hasn't been dealt a fair hand. But she's extremely bright and I hope she gets the chance to prove herself."" Like Combs, he believes outsiders are the primary drivers of the violence and mayhem in Philadelphia. ""Social media is the driver,"" he said. ""It's coming from somewhere else, outsiders hijacking peaceful protests."" So why not Camden? Neil, the city resident and longtime activist who makes her way around in a shiny, new motorized blue-and-white scooter, has a simple theory of why there is not rioting or looting in Camden. ""There's nothing in Camden!"" she said. ""What are they going to do: Go to the aquarium and steal the fish?! We don't have enough stores, there's nothing to steal. I wish they would steal the politicians."" ""I don't fear any of that in Camden because of the dynamics in Camden,"" said Combs. ""We don't have a concentration of stores. We're still fighting for a full-service supermarket in Camden. The stores are all in the neighborhoods and they're protected by the people who live there."" In this Saturday, May 30, 2020, photo, Lt. Zack James of the Camden County Metro Police Department marches along with demonstrators in Camden, N.J., to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police officers in one of New Jersey's largest and most violent cities were praised on social media for marching alongside protesters in rallies held this weekend over Floyd's death. (April Saul via AP) (Photo: April Saul, AP) Kimberly Mutcherson, co-dean of Rutgers-Camden Law School (its first black, female and LGBT dean in the school's history) and an expert on race and the law, said Camden's law enforcement leaders set themselves apart from those in other cities in a ""profound"" way. ""One thing that's interesting about Camden is that there was, from the beginning, a police department and chief who recognized that the protesters, the people out there, their cause is righteous. ""The bottom line is, we've seen this over and over and over, and if people in law enforcement don't take it seriously, we will see it again."" Riots, she said, paraphrasing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., are the expression of people who have been otherwise unheard. Mutcherson, who's taught at the school since 2002 and lives in Collingswood, a diverse suburb next to Camden, said ""there's this unfair reputation that Camden has as a city of crime, but that's not the city I see. It's a city of people working and raising families, people who just want to live safely and in peace, like any other people."" Wysocki called the national attention and praise from Obama ""humbling."" The son of a Camden police officer, Wysocki is acutely aware of the impact riots have on cities like his — its earlier riots were precipitated by tension between police and minority residents. ""We love Camden and we love the people of Camden,"" he said. ""It gets a bad rap but crime is down; we had 15 homicides last year and this year it's four."" Jones admitted she's anticipating ""a lot of sleepless nights"" as cities across America continue to experience violent unrest. ""We're talking about the City of Brotherly Love — we're neighbors. We're all affected by this."" But, she said, she's ""incredibly proud of my city"" for remaining peaceful. ""Since Camden has been in a negative light for so long, I'm happy to see it be a model for peaceful protest to the rest of the country.""

In 2012, with a decimated police force, the city set a grim milestone with a record high 67 homicides. The new, county-run department, initially led by Chief J. Scott Thomson, hired some of the city officers and recruited new officers. Thomson began his career with the city department and rose through its ranks to become its youngest chief. With the newly-formed department, he placed an emphasis on community policing, drawing national attention and presidential praise. Buy Photo President Barack Obama gestures towards the crowd prior to speaking at the Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center in Camden on Monday. (Photo: Chris LaChall/Courier-Post) Thomson retired last year, and Joe Wysocki, who'd served as his second-in-command since 2016, took over, intent on continuing and expanding upon Thomson's emphasis on engagement. The department has not been without its critics. There were initial charges of union busting (officers are now members of a local Fraternal Order of Police) and worries that bringing recruits from outside the city — many of them young and inexperienced in urban policing — would soon abandon Camden for more lucrative jobs with suburban departments. The county-run department led many city activists to cry foul, saying the county was imposing the change upon disenfranchised residents. Vida Neil, a city resident and activist, called it a ""rogue police force."" ""Their idea of community policing is to set up a barbecue grill and pull up an ice cream truck,"" said Neil, who lives in the city's Morgan Village section. ""But whatever happened to foot patrols? Whatever happened to cops who know residents, and walk the streets? They don't even respond to calls."" Singling out officers who remained from the city force — Neil is a retired Public Works employee whose last job was at the department's headquarters — she said that ""some of the new officers aren't trained right and they're not getting socialized. The young white ones were raised with the dangers of Camden, and they're just thrown into this."" County spokesman Dan Keashen said the department is now 54 percent minority, in a city that is 42 percent African American, 50.3 percent Hispanic and 21.9 percent white, according to 2019 U.S. Census estimates. Many in the city believe the department should hire more minorities to better reflect those they are policing. Wysocki, speaking to the Courier-Post Monday, said he ""can't say we're perfect."" ""To be honest, I agree with their complaint,"" said the chief. ""I 100 percent support them, but my hands are tied"" by state Civil Service requirements on hiring. He said he's spoken with state legislators representing Camden to loosen requirements so the department can hire more city residents. ""To the naysayers, I would say that's seven years ago,"" said Wysocki. ""Get to know us. I am happy to sit down and talk to anyone who wants to talk with us. Communities and police have to work together. Give us a chance."" Marching in Camden ""We didn't want to destroy our neighborhood,"" said Tawanda Jones, a city resident and founder of Camden Sophisticated Sisters, a dance and drill team that places academic and community service requirements on its members. The march was Deaver's vision, Jones said, but as more people reached out to participate, concern began to grow about keeping it orderly. ""There was a fear of outsiders coming in to riot in our city,"" said Rev. Levi Combs III of First Refuge Progressive Baptist Church in Camden. ""Our focus was to make sure this was in memory of George Floyd."" ""What was in the back of my mind was helping people understand why we as African Americans are frustrated with the system. My perspective as a minister and someone educated in the city was more about ensuring our people were safe (from COVID-19), how to not spread the virus, make sure we did this in a safe manner, and sending the message that Camden is not what it is perceived to be."" Deaver, who moved from Camden to Sicklerville three years ago, said, ""I know it's a rough city. I have friends who were murdered in the city, and it's a rough city to have police come and march with us."" Yolanda Deaver, right, talks to U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (left) and Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki at a march in memory of George Floyd in Camden on Saturday. (Photo: Courtesy Yolanda Deaver) ""Tensions are so high with the death of George Floyd,"" said Wysocki, ""it's horrible, what happened to him is just horrible, and I thought, I have got to go. So I asked the clergy if I could go and they said yes."" Wysocki and Deaver were introduced Saturday before the march. ""It was an honor (to participate),"" he said. He asked, he said, ""because this was her march. I was learning from her."" At one point, Deaver said, she yelled, ""Black lives matter!,"" but turned to Wysocki, who is white, worried he might be upset. ""But I understood,"" he said. ""That's what we were there for. People were able to voice their frustration at the Police Administration Building"" — with policing in Camden and all over — ""and I am glad they did. This was all about the community and I'm honored they let us be part of it."" ""What I will give credit to (Wysocki) for is, he is willing to come to the people,"" said Combs. ""He does not want a riot on his hands. He wants community policing and he wants them engaged, and he's admitted there have been problems."" The department, Combs said, needs more minority officers; complaints of disenfranchisement are valid, he said. ""Residents feel that they don't have any power or influence over their police department and don't have a say in how they police the city. Some feel they are profiled and marginalized. People want to see diversity in law enforcement. ""These were the cries of the people in the march and I believe the chief sees that."" Ugliness across the river As the march ended in Camden, peace settled over the city on a mild late spring Saturday. But in Philadelphia, what began as a peaceful assembly at the Philadelphia Museum of Art dissipated as some protesters marched back to City Hall and north on Broad Street. By nightfall, the city was engulfed in chaos, flames, rioting and looting. The Delaware River Port Authority kept its PATCO Hi-Speedline trains out of the city; the Benjamin Franklin Bridge was closed to vehicle and foot traffic and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney imposed a curfew before ordering all retail businesses within the city to closed. From Camden, residents could see the black smoke rising, and at night they could hear the sounds of unrest. ""As we were on our march, my phone started going off like crazy,"" said Jones. ""I have some babies in Philadelphia and I told them to stay in the house, don't go outside. One was stuck in the city and I was on my GPS trying to help her get out."" She called Philadelphia's violence ""so disheartening."" She believes the many peaceful protesters from earlier in the day went home and people from outside the city instigated the violence. ""People are desperate; some of them are in it for the cause and some were just out there to see what they could get. Some people were just in survival mode."" Combs agreed the rioting ""is not a black thing. I see white instigation. We need to be fair: What saddens me as I see it unfold (for a third day Monday) is it's only one-sided (in media portrayals). What's being done is in equal share in my opinion; it's white instigation and agitation and it's blacks looting and rioting, but this is not what we do in our culture and our community. This is not common, but this is a narrative in the media, that only blacks loot and riot."" ""My heart went out to,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner (Danielle Outlaw, said Wysocki. She came to the city from Portland and within weeks the city, like the entire country, found itself in the midst of a global pandemic. ""She hasn't been dealt a fair hand. But she's extremely bright and I hope she gets the chance to prove herself."" Like Combs, he believes outsiders are the primary drivers of the violence and mayhem in Philadelphia. ""Social media is the driver,"" he said. ""It's coming from somewhere else, outsiders hijacking peaceful protests."" So why not Camden? Neil, the city resident and longtime activist who makes her way around in a shiny, new motorized blue-and-white scooter, has a simple theory of why there is not rioting or looting in Camden. ""There's nothing in Camden!"" she said. ""What are they going to do: Go to the aquarium and steal the fish?! We don't have enough stores, there's nothing to steal. I wish they would steal the politicians."" ""I don't fear any of that in Camden because of the dynamics in Camden,"" said Combs. ""We don't have a concentration of stores. We're still fighting for a full-service supermarket in Camden. The stores are all in the neighborhoods and they're protected by the people who live there."" In this Saturday, May 30, 2020, photo, Lt. Zack James of the Camden County Metro Police Department marches along with demonstrators in Camden, N.J., to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police officers in one of New Jersey's largest and most violent cities were praised on social media for marching alongside protesters in rallies held this weekend over Floyd's death. (April Saul via AP) (Photo: April Saul, AP) Kimberly Mutcherson, co-dean of Rutgers-Camden Law School (its first black, female and LGBT dean in the school's history) and an expert on race and the law, said Camden's law enforcement leaders set themselves apart from those in other cities in a ""profound"" way. ""One thing that's interesting about Camden is that there was, from the beginning, a police department and chief who recognized that the protesters, the people out there, their cause is righteous. ""The bottom line is, we've seen this over and over and over, and if people in law enforcement don't take it seriously, we will see it again."" Riots, she said, paraphrasing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., are the expression of people who have been otherwise unheard. Mutcherson, who's taught at the school since 2002 and lives in Collingswood, a diverse suburb next to Camden, said ""there's this unfair reputation that Camden has as a city of crime, but that's not the city I see. It's a city of people working and raising families, people who just want to live safely and in peace, like any other people."" Wysocki called the national attention and praise from Obama ""humbling."" The son of a Camden police officer, Wysocki is acutely aware of the impact riots have on cities like his — its earlier riots were precipitated by tension between police and minority residents. ""We love Camden and we love the people of Camden,"" he said. ""It gets a bad rap but crime is down; we had 15 homicides last year and this year it's four."" Jones admitted she's anticipating ""a lot of sleepless nights"" as cities across America continue to experience violent unrest. ""We're talking about the City of Brotherly Love — we're neighbors. We're all affected by this."" But, she said, she's ""incredibly proud of my city"" for remaining peaceful. ""Since Camden has been in a negative light for so long, I'm happy to see it be a model for peaceful protest to the rest of the country.""

1622762568,2020-06-01 20:01:57,Philly NAACP president talks about George Floyd protests,https://whyy.org/articles/philly-naacp-president-talks-about-george-floyd-protests/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"Unrest and looting shook Philadelphia over the weekend, but the city also witnessed peaceful rallies and protests to decry the death of George Floyd, the Black man who died one week ago at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. The officer has been charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. One speaker over the weekend at City Hall in Philadelphia was Minister Rodney Muhammad, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP, the country’s oldest and largest nonpartisan civil rights organization. He joined Morning Edition host Jennifer Lynn to talk about the turbulent weekend in Philadelphia. – Minister Muhammad, welcome. Well, thank you for having me. Good morning. Pleasure to have you, sir. There are many layers to our story of police brutality and the fight for justice for all people. What is unique about the anger and sadness being expressed in Philadelphia now? Well, to be honest, for Black America, when we saw the horrific ordeal of that video of George Floyd’s life being strangled right out of him, it was another addition to a long set of chapters of police brutality that we suffered in this country. We have never resolved this problem. The police, they represent the enforcers of a racist system. That’s the universe that Black people live in. So it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back. Some say it’s the drop of water that caused the cup to overflow. We reached the boiling point, a tipping point. We can see that America, Black and white, is upset about this. I think that people are open to conversation. It doesn’t look like this is going to go away as fast as some may have hoped. Yeah, and you addressed a peaceful crowd yesterday in front of City Hall. What message did you most fervently want to share with the people who gathered with you? There’s been a problem in our struggle even since the ‘60s and well-meaning whites who have worked hard with Dr. King and others to try to end some of the …{inaudible} they saw Black people living in and not being able to vote. There are some things that happen to Black people that are very clear to white America that injustices are being done to us. But there are other systemic things that are very, very difficult for white America to see, as they have expressed. And because of the difficulty in seeing the disparities and the unequal way we’re dealt with, it becomes difficult to really do something effective about police brutality. So our message yesterday was at this time, we should be having a conversation about the difficult decision of reassigning white police officers to white areas of the cities of America, and reassigning officers of color to those communities that are identifiably Black or African American and brown people until something is done on a large scale therapeutic level. We’ll keep counting bodies in the morgue because [of] the sickness that is expressed by too many white officers. We don’t have time to treat it [with] on-the-job training while they are overseeing Black people in neighborhoods primarily populated by us with a whole host of disadvantaging circumstances. Now, many officers, of course, are doing their jobs and being respectful of you. We believe that there are good officers of every stripe and color or ethnicity, if you will. They’re just not good enough to stop the bad. Yes, sir. Sir, is there a promise? I’m sorry to interrupt. There is a promise to this nation for justice for all. What meaningful reform can you work toward to help keep bad cops accountable? I know you do such work. Well, we have to think of the long-term game, obviously, legislation and policy. Those are things that the NAACP focuses on. And that’s why they work in the courts to roll back what we call civil rights gains, because they know that in a very solid way, when we can get laws changed, when we can get a policy established, we have that basis for which to work from [within] the law. Even Dr. King said, the law can’t make a man love me. He said religion and education must do that. He said, but the law can keep him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, too. So the NAACP is focused on a long game, and our long game is we got to do something in November to change the personnel in government. And tomorrow is primary Election Day for those who were planning to go to the polls in some of the neighborhoods in Philadelphia that have been under duress. That is a difficult journey to get to those polls. Well, it is. And you know, the NAACP, along with others, we’re saying, “Look, you came out in numbers because you want to be heard. Come out in even greater numbers that you can be counted. Come out and vote.” Sir, you are a minister; you counsel people; you comfort them. For those who are sad, who are scared, men and women, young and old, Black and white. Where is their hope? Well, our hope is in righteousness. And the only psychology that’s gonna work for white America and Black America today is truth. If we’re not going to be truthful, we’re not going to repair the psychological state that white supremacy has done to make someone who’s white feel supreme only because the color of their skin is white. To make someone else feel less than only because the color of their skin is black. And we’ve both been here over 400 years. And we’ve trained ourselves in these kinds of dark dichotomies and these dynamics. So there has to be a real re-education process. Short of overhauling the police departments in America that have grown very powerful through their unions… Now, it’s not likely that that’s going to happen for a long time. And that’s why I’m calling for a reassignment of officers who are white from areas that are predominantly identifiably Black. And, you know, there is hope. If we start taking some of the right steps, there is hope. If white America and Black America have the real kind of conversation, there is hope. If we change the relationship from a colonizer/colonized relationship, or a slave master/slave relationship, to one where we’re on equitable terms and we live like human beings here. Thank you. Thank you so much. It can get better. I agree. Thank you so much. Minister Rodney Muhammad, president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP. Thank you for your time this morning.",0.0

Photo by Leonidas Cruz. × Mayor Stack and Chief Luster march with protestors on June 2. Photo by Leonidas Cruz. Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from Trenton to Newark, with local officers marching with protesters against police violence in some municipalities. On June 2, a peaceful protest occurred in Union City in which Mayor Brian Stack and Chief of Police Nichelle Luster were spotted marching at the front with protestors. When the march stopped to take a knee in honor of George Floyd and other lives lost to police brutality, both Mayor Stack and Chief Luster took a knee with protestors. Mayor Stack was also present at the North Hudson peaceful protest on June 7, which marched from Braddock Park in North Bergen to Union City. Mayor Stack and Chief Luster offered their condolences concerning the May 25 death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. Mayor Stack said that the unjust death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the population. “The tragic death of Mr. George Floyd represents a complete breakdown of what our country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings of our society and demands for us to do better,” Mayor Stack said. “The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative about race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been discriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.” Over the last few months, the “new normal” from the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times, Mayor Stack said that Union City has always stood together in solidarity as one community. Stack, who is also Union City’s police director, said that if there is change in the local community prompted from Floyd’s death, it should be done together, hand-in-hand with the police. “It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the relationships the police department have with the community,” Stack continued. “If we are going create change for the betterment of Union City, we must do so together.” To actually serve and protect Chief Luster offered her condolences for George Floyd, saying that she was deeply saddened and disturbed by the events in Minneapolis. Luster said that the actions that resulted in the death of Mr. George Floyd are contrary to New Jersey police training standards and contrary to New Jersey law. “The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to establish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-enforcement professionals everywhere,” Chief Luster said. Police officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion, proficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is unacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud of the relationship the department has with their residents in Union City. “Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and understanding of individual differences, can we be successful,” Luster said. “My heartfelt thanks go out to the Union City community for your continued support.” For updates on this and other stories, check www.hudsonreporter.com and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter.

1622766643,2020-06-01 12:55:07,Hoboken mayor condemns the murder of George Floyd,https://hudsonreporter.com/2020/06/01/hoboken-mayor-condemns-the-murder-of-george-floyd/,en,False,,662073,Hoboken Reporter,http://www.hudsonreporter.com/pages/hoboken,"× Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla took to Facebook over the weekend to express his sorrow regarding the murder of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed in Minneapolis on May 25 when an officer kneeled on his neck and back during an arrest after a deli employee called 911, accusing Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill. “Racism and racial bias are both conscious and unconscious,” said Mayor Ravi Bhalla. “Many Americans across the country are protesting for good reason: an innocent black man was killed in cold blood by a police officer for no reason whatsoever.” Calling it “unacceptable,” he called for the four officers involved to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.” State prosecutors charged former Police Officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for the death of Floyd. According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend. Another video of Saturday’s protest depicts an NYPD officer pulling down the face mask of a protester before shooting the person with pepper spray. Concrete action required “None of this, however, will bring George Floyd back, or lessen the pain and suffering of his family and friends,” Bhalla said. “I stand in solidarity with the patriotic Americans across the country who are peacefully expressing their anger, shock and outrage by this brutal killing.” He added that he supports peaceful protest and demonstrations while condemning those who use the protest to incite violence. “Peaceful protesters should be listened to, heard, and respected, and should not be dismissed because of the hostile actions of those who have misused protests to incite violence, which is reprehensible and doing a great disservice to the memory of George Floyd,” said Bhalla. who noted that protests are not enough. The mayor said concrete action must occur in order to effect change. “After this phase of grief, frustration and anger passes, we cannot go on with our normal lives, as we always seem to do,” Bhalla said. “Unless we proactively address and correct the underlying causes of this murder, there will be more George Floyds in the future. Unless we have honest conversations which translate into concrete action, racial disparities afflicting African-Americans will continue to persist. Unless we have more African-Americans in law enforcement and positions of political authority, justice will continue to be delayed and denied.” Bhalla took the opportunity to commend the local Hoboken Police Department which he said has not had a civil suit brought against any of its officers for excessive force or racial influenced policing in more than six years. “We have not had a criminal complaint against any of our officers for this in the same time period,” Bhalla said. “This is not a coincidence. It’s a result of the proactive community policing they do each and every day. Thank you to Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante and all the members of the HPD who I know are as pained as the rest of us and also standing against racism within our mile square city.” He said Hoboken grieves along with the rest of the country and prayed that Floyd may “Rest in Power.” “I pray for our country to address the root causes of just the latest example of the America’s original sin,” said Bhalla who ended his post with a quote from Frederick Douglass, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”",0.0

He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, pictured in this article, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Board members outraged Vice President Christopher Munoz condemned the post. “This is absolutely deplorable,” Munoz said. “How dare he encourage violence in our beautiful city.” In another statement on Facebook, Munoz said that he is deeply concerned and saddened by Trustee Alonso’s Social Media post. “As a Citizen, Taxpayer, Husband, Father, Educator, and Vice President of the Bayonne Board of Education, I feel Alonso’s post is beneath his position as a BBOED Trustee and is not indicative of the sentiments of our community,” Munoz said. “Bayonne is a progressive city that has been at the forefront of major change and community spirit,” he continued. “Our Students, Staff, Parents, and Community deserve better than this.” Board of Ed Trustee Jodi Casais spoke against the posts in sharp and pointed words also on Facebook. “And this my friends, makes me sick,” Casais said. “This is an elected official, a trustee for the BBOED posting this!!!!!!!!” Casais went on to question how he was elected, reminding voters that he is up for reelection this year. “How he was even Elected the first time blows my mind,” Casais said. “Remember this in November because his term is up on The board, and he is running for re-election. This Is an absolute disgrace!!!!!!!!!” Residents condemn Alonso Many residents also questioned how he was elected on to the Board despite his views. “What is wrong with him?” Lynn Marie Burbank wrote. “I pray the voters figure it out before they re-elect this guy based on his bs promises.” “Truly a disgrace,” Anthony D’Amico said. Mike Morris, outspoken Bayonne resident and a familiar presence in city council meetings, condemned the post, saying “there are no real words for his ignorance here.” “As a sworn BOE Trustee, he has a civil and moral obligation to protect the students, teachers, workers, and residents that elected him as a Trustee,” Morris wrote. “Reckless statements like this can and will be taken by some as a seal of approval to commit horrible crimes like we all have seen recently.” “He should pray to God that no one of any race, age, color, and especially children are ever injured because of his reckless and cavalier statement,” Morris continued. Calls for resignation mounting Some have called for Alonso to resign following the posts. “Can he just go already,” Jill Klarmann wrote. “You should be fired,” Rich Moscatiello wrote. “How do we petition to get him removed immediately?” Stephen Waz wrote. Many residents were calling for his immediate removal from the board by sending the posts to the Superintendent, urging for action to be taken. Trustee Casais said, “Everyone needs to email the board.” “He shouldn’t be allowed to sit on that board until November. He needs to be removed now,” Tina Casais wrote. “BOE, better get him removed NOW!!” Phyllis Sims wrote. “He needs to be removed… NOW,” Bridget Peterson Schumacher said. “He can never and should never hold an elected position in this city or anywhere ever again.” Melissa Godesky-Rodriguez said. “The city of Bayonne and our BBOED should not have to be associated with this.” Emergency meeting scheduled The Bayonne Board of Education will hold an emergency meeting on June 2 at 9 a.m. at the Anna J. Herbert meeting room. According to a joint press release by Board of Ed President Maria Valado and Superintendent John Niesz, the meeting is required in order to deal with a matter of such urgency and importance that a delay for the purpose of providing adequate notice would likely result in substantial harm to public interest. “The meeting will be limited to discussion of and acting with respect to conduct by a trustee,” the statement said. The Bayonne Board of Education could not reasonably have foreseen the need for this meeting at a time when adequate notice could have been provided. The meeting will proceed upon the affirmative vote of three quarters of the members present. A closed session may be called by the board to discuss matters exempt by law.” The public can attend in person, but occupancy is limited to 25 people, and those who wish to attend will be tested at the door for a fever, to limit the spread of COVID-19. The meeting will be streamed virtually via the Board of Ed’s YouTube page. Members of the public who wish to comment can email their comments or questions to the Board Secretary’s at gmaita@bboed.org. Michael Alonso could not be reached for comment.

Mayor Stack said that the unjust death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the population. “The tragic death of Mr. George Floyd represents a complete breakdown of what our country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings of our society and demands for us to do better,” Mayor Stack said. “The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative about race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been discriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.” Over the last few months, the “new normal” from the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times, Mayor Stack said that Union City has always stood together in solidarity as one community. Stack, who is also Union City’s police director, said that if there is change in the local community prompted from Floyd’s death, it should be done together, hand-in-hand with the police. “It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the relationships the police department have with the community,” Stack continued. “If we are going create change for the betterment of Union City, we must do so together.” To actually serve and protect Chief Luster offered her condolences for George Floyd, saying that she was deeply saddened and disturbed by the events in Minneapolis. Luster said that the actions that resulted in the death of Mr. George Floyd are contrary to New Jersey police training standards and contrary to New Jersey law. “The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to establish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-enforcement professionals everywhere,” Chief Luster said. Police officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion, proficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is unacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud of the relationship the department has with their residents in Union City. “Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and understanding of individual differences, can we be successful,” Luster said. “My heartfelt thanks go out to the Union City community for your continued support.” For updates on this and other stories, check www.hudsonreporter.com and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter.

According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend. Another video of Saturday’s protest depicts an NYPD officer pulling down the face mask of a protester before shooting the person with pepper spray. Concrete action required “None of this, however, will bring George Floyd back, or lessen the pain and suffering of his family and friends,” Bhalla said. “I stand in solidarity with the patriotic Americans across the country who are peacefully expressing their anger, shock and outrage by this brutal killing.” He added that he supports peaceful protest and demonstrations while condemning those who use the protest to incite violence. “Peaceful protesters should be listened to, heard, and respected, and should not be dismissed because of the hostile actions of those who have misused protests to incite violence, which is reprehensible and doing a great disservice to the memory of George Floyd,” said Bhalla. who noted that protests are not enough. The mayor said concrete action must occur in order to effect change. “After this phase of grief, frustration and anger passes, we cannot go on with our normal lives, as we always seem to do,” Bhalla said. “Unless we proactively address and correct the underlying causes of this murder, there will be more George Floyds in the future. Unless we have honest conversations which translate into concrete action, racial disparities afflicting African-Americans will continue to persist. Unless we have more African-Americans in law enforcement and positions of political authority, justice will continue to be delayed and denied.” Bhalla took the opportunity to commend the local Hoboken Police Department which he said has not had a civil suit brought against any of its officers for excessive force or racial influenced policing in more than six years. “We have not had a criminal complaint against any of our officers for this in the same time period,” Bhalla said. “This is not a coincidence. It’s a result of the proactive community policing they do each and every day. Thank you to Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante and all the members of the HPD who I know are as pained as the rest of us and also standing against racism within our mile square city.” He said Hoboken grieves along with the rest of the country and prayed that Floyd may “Rest in Power.” “I pray for our country to address the root causes of just the latest example of the America’s original sin,” said Bhalla who ended his post with a quote from Frederick Douglass, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”",0.0

He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, pictured in this article, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Board members outraged Vice President Christopher Munoz condemned the post. “This is absolutely deplorable,” Munoz said. “How dare he encourage violence in our beautiful city.” In another statement on Facebook, Munoz said that he is deeply concerned and saddened by Trustee Alonso’s Social Media post. “As a Citizen, Taxpayer, Husband, Father, Educator, and Vice President of the Bayonne Board of Education, I feel Alonso’s post is beneath his position as a BBOED Trustee and is not indicative of the sentiments of our community,” Munoz said. “Bayonne is a progressive city that has been at the forefront of major change and community spirit,” he continued. “Our Students, Staff, Parents, and Community deserve better than this.” Board of Ed Trustee Jodi Casais spoke against the posts in sharp and pointed words also on Facebook. “And this my friends, makes me sick,” Casais said. “This is an elected official, a trustee for the BBOED posting this!!!!!!!!” Casais went on to question how he was elected, reminding voters that he is up for reelection this year. “How he was even Elected the first time blows my mind,” Casais said. “Remember this in November because his term is up on The board, and he is running for re-election. This Is an absolute disgrace!!!!!!!!!” Residents condemn Alonso Many residents also questioned how he was elected on to the Board despite his views. “What is wrong with him?” Lynn Marie Burbank wrote. “I pray the voters figure it out before they re-elect this guy based on his bs promises.” “Truly a disgrace,” Anthony D’Amico said. Mike Morris, outspoken Bayonne resident and a familiar presence in city council meetings, condemned the post, saying “there are no real words for his ignorance here.” “As a sworn BOE Trustee, he has a civil and moral obligation to protect the students, teachers, workers, and residents that elected him as a Trustee,” Morris wrote. “Reckless statements like this can and will be taken by some as a seal of approval to commit horrible crimes like we all have seen recently.” “He should pray to God that no one of any race, age, color, and especially children are ever injured because of his reckless and cavalier statement,” Morris continued. Calls for resignation mounting Some have called for Alonso to resign following the posts. “Can he just go already,” Jill Klarmann wrote. “You should be fired,” Rich Moscatiello wrote. “How do we petition to get him removed immediately?” Stephen Waz wrote. Many residents were calling for his immediate removal from the board by sending the posts to the Superintendent, urging for action to be taken. Trustee Casais said, “Everyone needs to email the board.” “He shouldn’t be allowed to sit on that board until November. He needs to be removed now,” Tina Casais wrote. “BOE, better get him removed NOW!!” Phyllis Sims wrote. “He needs to be removed… NOW,” Bridget Peterson Schumacher said. “He can never and should never hold an elected position in this city or anywhere ever again.” Melissa Godesky-Rodriguez said. “The city of Bayonne and our BBOED should not have to be associated with this.” Emergency meeting scheduled The Bayonne Board of Education will hold an emergency meeting on June 2 at 9 a.m. at the Anna J. Herbert meeting room. According to a joint press release by Board of Ed President Maria Valado and Superintendent John Niesz, the meeting is required in order to deal with a matter of such urgency and importance that a delay for the purpose of providing adequate notice would likely result in substantial harm to public interest. “The meeting will be limited to discussion of and acting with respect to conduct by a trustee,” the statement said. The Bayonne Board of Education could not reasonably have foreseen the need for this meeting at a time when adequate notice could have been provided. The meeting will proceed upon the affirmative vote of three quarters of the members present. A closed session may be called by the board to discuss matters exempt by law.” The public can attend in person, but occupancy is limited to 25 people, and those who wish to attend will be tested at the door for a fever, to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from Trenton to Newark, with local officers marching with protesters against police violence in some municipalities. On June 2, a peaceful protest occurred in Union City in which Mayor Brian Stack and Chief of Police Nichelle Luster were spotted marching at the front with protestors. When the march stopped to take a knee in honor of George Floyd and other lives lost to police brutality, both Mayor Stack and Chief Luster took a knee with protestors. Mayor Stack was also present at the North Hudson peaceful protest on June 7, which marched from Braddock Park in North Bergen to Union City. Mayor Stack and Chief Luster offered their condolences concerning the May 25 death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter.

He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, pictured in this article, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Board members outraged Vice President Christopher Munoz condemned the post. “This is absolutely deplorable,” Munoz said. “How dare he encourage violence in our beautiful city.” In another statement on Facebook, Munoz said that he is deeply concerned and saddened by Trustee Alonso’s Social Media post. “As a Citizen, Taxpayer, Husband, Father, Educator, and Vice President of the Bayonne Board of Education, I feel Alonso’s post is beneath his position as a BBOED Trustee and is not indicative of the sentiments of our community,” Munoz said. “Bayonne is a progressive city that has been at the forefront of major change and community spirit,” he continued. “Our Students, Staff, Parents, and Community deserve better than this.” Board of Ed Trustee Jodi Casais spoke against the posts in sharp and pointed words also on Facebook. “And this my friends, makes me sick,” Casais said. “This is an elected official, a trustee for the BBOED posting this!!!!!!!!” Casais went on to question how he was elected, reminding voters that he is up for reelection this year. “How he was even Elected the first time blows my mind,” Casais said. “Remember this in November because his term is up on The board, and he is running for re-election. This Is an absolute disgrace!!!!!!!!!” Residents condemn Alonso Many residents also questioned how he was elected on to the Board despite his views. “What is wrong with him?” Lynn Marie Burbank wrote. “I pray the voters figure it out before they re-elect this guy based on his bs promises.” “Truly a disgrace,” Anthony D’Amico said. Mike Morris, outspoken Bayonne resident and a familiar presence in city council meetings, condemned the post, saying “there are no real words for his ignorance here.” “As a sworn BOE Trustee, he has a civil and moral obligation to protect the students, teachers, workers, and residents that elected him as a Trustee,” Morris wrote. “Reckless statements like this can and will be taken by some as a seal of approval to commit horrible crimes like we all have seen recently.” “He should pray to God that no one of any race, age, color, and especially children are ever injured because of his reckless and cavalier statement,” Morris continued. Calls for resignation mounting Some have called for Alonso to resign following the posts. “Can he just go already,” Jill Klarmann wrote. “You should be fired,” Rich Moscatiello wrote. “How do we petition to get him removed immediately?” Stephen Waz wrote. Many residents were calling for his immediate removal from the board by sending the posts to the Superintendent, urging for action to be taken. Trustee Casais said, “Everyone needs to email the board.” “He shouldn’t be allowed to sit on that board until November. He needs to be removed now,” Tina Casais wrote. “BOE, better get him removed NOW!!” Phyllis Sims wrote. “He needs to be removed… NOW,” Bridget Peterson Schumacher said. “He can never and should never hold an elected position in this city or anywhere ever again.” Melissa Godesky-Rodriguez said. “The city of Bayonne and our BBOED should not have to be associated with this.” Emergency meeting scheduled The Bayonne Board of Education will hold an emergency meeting on June 2 at 9 a.m. at the Anna J. Herbert meeting room. According to a joint press release by Board of Ed President Maria Valado and Superintendent John Niesz, the meeting is required in order to deal with a matter of such urgency and importance that a delay for the purpose of providing adequate notice would likely result in substantial harm to public interest. “The meeting will be limited to discussion of and acting with respect to conduct by a trustee,” the statement said. The Bayonne Board of Education could not reasonably have foreseen the need for this meeting at a time when adequate notice could have been provided. The meeting will proceed upon the affirmative vote of three quarters of the members present. A closed session may be called by the board to discuss matters exempt by law.” The public can attend in person, but occupancy is limited to 25 people, and those who wish to attend will be tested at the door for a fever, to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Photo by Leonidas Cruz. × Mayor Stack and Chief Luster march with protestors on June 2. Photo by Leonidas Cruz. Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from Trenton to Newark, with local officers marching with protesters against police violence in some municipalities. On June 2, a peaceful protest occurred in Union City in which Mayor Brian Stack and Chief of Police Nichelle Luster were spotted marching at the front with protestors. When the march stopped to take a knee in honor of George Floyd and other lives lost to police brutality, both Mayor Stack and Chief Luster took a knee with protestors. Mayor Stack was also present at the North Hudson peaceful protest on June 7, which marched from Braddock Park in North Bergen to Union City. Mayor Stack and Chief Luster offered their condolences concerning the May 25 death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. Mayor Stack said that the unjust death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the population. “The tragic death of Mr. George Floyd represents a complete breakdown of what our country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings of our society and demands for us to do better,” Mayor Stack said. “The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative about race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been discriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.” Over the last few months, the “new normal” from the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times, Mayor Stack said that Union City has always stood together in solidarity as one community. Stack, who is also Union City’s police director, said that if there is change in the local community prompted from Floyd’s death, it should be done together, hand-in-hand with the police. “It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the relationships the police department have with the community,” Stack continued. “If we are going create change for the betterment of Union City, we must do so together.” To actually serve and protect Chief Luster offered her condolences for George Floyd, saying that she was deeply saddened and disturbed by the events in Minneapolis. Luster said that the actions that resulted in the death of Mr. George Floyd are contrary to New Jersey police training standards and contrary to New Jersey law. “The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to establish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-enforcement professionals everywhere,” Chief Luster said. Police officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion, proficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is unacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud of the relationship the department has with their residents in Union City. “Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and understanding of individual differences, can we be successful,” Luster said. “My heartfelt thanks go out to the Union City community for your continued support.” For updates on this and other stories, check www.hudsonreporter.com and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter.

According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend. Another video of Saturday’s protest depicts an NYPD officer pulling down the face mask of a protester before shooting the person with pepper spray. Concrete action required “None of this, however, will bring George Floyd back, or lessen the pain and suffering of his family and friends,” Bhalla said. “I stand in solidarity with the patriotic Americans across the country who are peacefully expressing their anger, shock and outrage by this brutal killing.” He added that he supports peaceful protest and demonstrations while condemning those who use the protest to incite violence. “Peaceful protesters should be listened to, heard, and respected, and should not be dismissed because of the hostile actions of those who have misused protests to incite violence, which is reprehensible and doing a great disservice to the memory of George Floyd,” said Bhalla. who noted that protests are not enough. The mayor said concrete action must occur in order to effect change. “After this phase of grief, frustration and anger passes, we cannot go on with our normal lives, as we always seem to do,” Bhalla said. “Unless we proactively address and correct the underlying causes of this murder, there will be more George Floyds in the future. Unless we have honest conversations which translate into concrete action, racial disparities afflicting African-Americans will continue to persist. Unless we have more African-Americans in law enforcement and positions of political authority, justice will continue to be delayed and denied.” Bhalla took the opportunity to commend the local Hoboken Police Department which he said has not had a civil suit brought against any of its officers for excessive force or racial influenced policing in more than six years. “We have not had a criminal complaint against any of our officers for this in the same time period,” Bhalla said. “This is not a coincidence. It’s a result of the proactive community policing they do each and every day. Thank you to Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante and all the members of the HPD who I know are as pained as the rest of us and also standing against racism within our mile square city.” He said Hoboken grieves along with the rest of the country and prayed that Floyd may “Rest in Power.” “I pray for our country to address the root causes of just the latest example of the America’s original sin,” said Bhalla who ended his post with a quote from Frederick Douglass, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”",0.0

Unless we have honest conversations which translate into concrete action, racial disparities afflicting African-Americans will continue to persist. Unless we have more African-Americans in law enforcement and positions of political authority, justice will continue to be delayed and denied.” Bhalla took the opportunity to commend the local Hoboken Police Department which he said has not had a civil suit brought against any of its officers for excessive force or racial influenced policing in more than six years. “We have not had a criminal complaint against any of our officers for this in the same time period,” Bhalla said. “This is not a coincidence. It’s a result of the proactive community policing they do each and every day. Thank you to Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante and all the members of the HPD who I know are as pained as the rest of us and also standing against racism within our mile square city.” He said Hoboken grieves along with the rest of the country and prayed that Floyd may “Rest in Power.” “I pray for our country to address the root causes of just the latest example of the America’s original sin,” said Bhalla who ended his post with a quote from Frederick Douglass, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”",0.0

Photo by Leonidas Cruz. × Mayor Stack and Chief Luster march with protestors on June 2. Photo by Leonidas Cruz. Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from Trenton to Newark, with local officers marching with protesters against police violence in some municipalities. On June 2, a peaceful protest occurred in Union City in which Mayor Brian Stack and Chief of Police Nichelle Luster were spotted marching at the front with protestors. When the march stopped to take a knee in honor of George Floyd and other lives lost to police brutality, both Mayor Stack and Chief Luster took a knee with protestors. Mayor Stack was also present at the North Hudson peaceful protest on June 7, which marched from Braddock Park in North Bergen to Union City. Mayor Stack and Chief Luster offered their condolences concerning the May 25 death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. Mayor Stack said that the unjust death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the population. “The tragic death of Mr. George Floyd represents a complete breakdown of what our country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings of our society and demands for us to do better,” Mayor Stack said. “The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative about race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been discriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.” Over the last few months, the “new normal” from the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times, Mayor Stack said that Union City has always stood together in solidarity as one community. Stack, who is also Union City’s police director, said that if there is change in the local community prompted from Floyd’s death, it should be done together, hand-in-hand with the police. “It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the relationships the police department have with the community,” Stack continued. “If we are going create change for the betterment of Union City, we must do so together.” To actually serve and protect Chief Luster offered her condolences for George Floyd, saying that she was deeply saddened and disturbed by the events in Minneapolis. Luster said that the actions that resulted in the death of Mr. George Floyd are contrary to New Jersey police training standards and contrary to New Jersey law. “The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to establish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-enforcement professionals everywhere,” Chief Luster said. Police officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion, proficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is unacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud of the relationship the department has with their residents in Union City. “Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and understanding of individual differences, can we be successful,” Luster said. “My heartfelt thanks go out to the Union City community for your continued support.” For updates on this and other stories, check www.hudsonreporter.com and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter.

Board members outraged Vice President Christopher Munoz condemned the post. “This is absolutely deplorable,” Munoz said. “How dare he encourage violence in our beautiful city.” In another statement on Facebook, Munoz said that he is deeply concerned and saddened by Trustee Alonso’s Social Media post. “As a Citizen, Taxpayer, Husband, Father, Educator, and Vice President of the Bayonne Board of Education, I feel Alonso’s post is beneath his position as a BBOED Trustee and is not indicative of the sentiments of our community,” Munoz said. “Bayonne is a progressive city that has been at the forefront of major change and community spirit,” he continued. “Our Students, Staff, Parents, and Community deserve better than this.” Board of Ed Trustee Jodi Casais spoke against the posts in sharp and pointed words also on Facebook. “And this my friends, makes me sick,” Casais said. “This is an elected official, a trustee for the BBOED posting this!!!!!!!!” Casais went on to question how he was elected, reminding voters that he is up for reelection this year. “How he was even Elected the first time blows my mind,” Casais said. “Remember this in November because his term is up on The board, and he is running for re-election.

Mike Morris, outspoken Bayonne resident and a familiar presence in city council meetings, condemned the post, saying “there are no real words for his ignorance here.” “As a sworn BOE Trustee, he has a civil and moral obligation to protect the students, teachers, workers, and residents that elected him as a Trustee,” Morris wrote. “Reckless statements like this can and will be taken by some as a seal of approval to commit horrible crimes like we all have seen recently.” “He should pray to God that no one of any race, age, color, and especially children are ever injured because of his reckless and cavalier statement,” Morris continued.

According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend.

Unless we have more African-Americans in law enforcement and positions of political authority, justice will continue to be delayed and denied.” Bhalla took the opportunity to commend the local Hoboken Police Department which he said has not had a civil suit brought against any of its officers for excessive force or racial influenced policing in more than six years. “We have not had a criminal complaint against any of our officers for this in the same time period,” Bhalla said. “This is not a coincidence. It’s a result of the proactive community policing they do each and every day. Thank you to Police Chief Kenneth Ferrante and all the members of the HPD who I know are as pained as the rest of us and also standing against racism within our mile square city.” He said Hoboken grieves along with the rest of the country and prayed that Floyd may “Rest in Power.” “I pray for our country to address the root causes of just the latest example of the America’s original sin,” said Bhalla who ended his post with a quote from Frederick Douglass, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”",0.0

He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, pictured in this article, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Board members outraged Vice President Christopher Munoz condemned the post. “This is absolutely deplorable,” Munoz said. “How dare he encourage violence in our beautiful city.” In another statement on Facebook, Munoz said that he is deeply concerned and saddened by Trustee Alonso’s Social Media post. “As a Citizen, Taxpayer, Husband, Father, Educator, and Vice President of the Bayonne Board of Education, I feel Alonso’s post is beneath his position as a BBOED Trustee and is not indicative of the sentiments of our community,” Munoz said. “Bayonne is a progressive city that has been at the forefront of major change and community spirit,” he continued. “Our Students, Staff, Parents, and Community deserve better than this.” Board of Ed Trustee Jodi Casais spoke against the posts in sharp and pointed words also on Facebook. “And this my friends, makes me sick,” Casais said. “This is an elected official, a trustee for the BBOED posting this!!!!!!!!” Casais went on to question how he was elected, reminding voters that he is up for reelection this year. “How he was even Elected the first time blows my mind,” Casais said. “Remember this in November because his term is up on The board, and he is running for re-election. This Is an absolute disgrace!!!!!!!!!” Residents condemn Alonso Many residents also questioned how he was elected on to the Board despite his views. “What is wrong with him?” Lynn Marie Burbank wrote. “I pray the voters figure it out before they re-elect this guy based on his bs promises.” “Truly a disgrace,” Anthony D’Amico said. Mike Morris, outspoken Bayonne resident and a familiar presence in city council meetings, condemned the post, saying “there are no real words for his ignorance here.” “As a sworn BOE Trustee, he has a civil and moral obligation to protect the students, teachers, workers, and residents that elected him as a Trustee,” Morris wrote. “Reckless statements like this can and will be taken by some as a seal of approval to commit horrible crimes like we all have seen recently.” “He should pray to God that no one of any race, age, color, and especially children are ever injured because of his reckless and cavalier statement,” Morris continued. Calls for resignation mounting Some have called for Alonso to resign following the posts. “Can he just go already,” Jill Klarmann wrote. “You should be fired,” Rich Moscatiello wrote. “How do we petition to get him removed immediately?” Stephen Waz wrote. Many residents were calling for his immediate removal from the board by sending the posts to the Superintendent, urging for action to be taken. Trustee Casais said, “Everyone needs to email the board.” “He shouldn’t be allowed to sit on that board until November. He needs to be removed now,” Tina Casais wrote. “BOE, better get him removed NOW!!” Phyllis Sims wrote. “He needs to be removed… NOW,” Bridget Peterson Schumacher said. “He can never and should never hold an elected position in this city or anywhere ever again.” Melissa Godesky-Rodriguez said. “The city of Bayonne and our BBOED should not have to be associated with this.” Emergency meeting scheduled The Bayonne Board of Education will hold an emergency meeting on June 2 at 9 a.m. at the Anna J. Herbert meeting room. According to a joint press release by Board of Ed President Maria Valado and Superintendent John Niesz, the meeting is required in order to deal with a matter of such urgency and importance that a delay for the purpose of providing adequate notice would likely result in substantial harm to public interest. “The meeting will be limited to discussion of and acting with respect to conduct by a trustee,” the statement said. The Bayonne Board of Education could not reasonably have foreseen the need for this meeting at a time when adequate notice could have been provided. The meeting will proceed upon the affirmative vote of three quarters of the members present. A closed session may be called by the board to discuss matters exempt by law.” The public can attend in person, but occupancy is limited to 25 people, and those who wish to attend will be tested at the door for a fever, to limit the spread of COVID-19. The meeting will be streamed virtually via the Board of Ed’s YouTube page. Members of the public who wish to comment can email their comments or questions to the Board Secretary’s at gmaita@bboed.org. Michael Alonso could not be reached for comment.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Seton Hall President Dr. Joseph Nyre spoke out for the first time on Saturday, speaking about the unrest currently sweeping the nation in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Dozens of American cities have been swarmed with protests over the last week with some peaceful demonstrations turning to riots at nightfall, sparking violent clashes between protesters and police. The country is currently bracing for a possible seventh night of violence on Monday. Demonstrators mourn at a vigil for George Floyd on May 30. (Fibonacci Blue/Flickr) “It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots,” read the quote from King attached in the statement. “It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society.” The statement comes seven days after the death of Floyd and less than a day after an editorial published by The Setonian leveled criticism at the University for its original statement, which was published on the School’s website and social channels on Saturday. “It is the job of these two organizations [the University and the Student Government Association], in particular, to make students feel not just welcome at this University, but heard,” the editorial read. “To make them feel like valued members of our shared community, something Mayor Baraka and Larry Hamm did at Saturday’s protest in Newark, a protest that should serve as a model for catharsis, healing and social activism in the wake of Floyd’s death. Yet, we have seen no such leadership on this front at Seton Hall.” The updated statement also came hours after a meeting between University administrators, including Nyre, and student leaders from the SGA Executive Cabinet, the Black Student Union and the former president of the Black Men of Standard, Kadean Dennis. “As we begin another week marked by shocking unrest in scores of American cities and towns, we as a University and as a nation are fighting two deadly afflictions — the diseases of COVID-19 and endemic racism,” read the statement, which was pushed out from Nyre’s office via a campus-wide email. The updated statement from Nyre went on to condemn racism and violence, promising more action from the University on diversity and inclusion. Nyre also announced that the SGA would begin work with the University’s Campus Ministry Department and the Division of Student Services “to help advance our voice across higher education, New Jersey and at Seton Hall.” “The black community is hurting immensely as the issues surrounding George Floyd’s death are issues that have persisted for centuries,” said Thanelie Bien-Aime, President of the Black Student Union. “More than anything, we want justice and to see real changes implemented to attack racist systems. We want to know that we are supported by the institutions meant to protect and represent us.” “The university’s first statement was a start but did not present any action plans to directly implement reform,” Bein-Aime continued. “Faith is important but I emphasized our need for faith and works to go hand in hand.” According to Bien-Aime, she and other leaders discussed how Seton Hall and SGA can “best support those impacted by the events surrounding George Floyd’s death.” “We also talked about ways to educate the SHU community and provide action steps. The new statement commits to taking steps to reform, but we as students need to hold our leadership accountable in following through,” she said. “I look forward to the working with them on programs and initiatives that promote anti-racism.” Last night, in their own statement, the SGA Executive Committee chaired by President Julia Nichols promised action from the organization, including re-sharing information for students educating them on how to aid in the effort against racism and violence, as well as coordinating a statement between other student governments from around the state. “The university stands with the black community and will be demonstrating that throughout this week,” Nichols said in a post to her Instagram story. “Please continue to put pressure on the university and SGA for action so together we may see change. We will be doing more than have faith.”",0.0

Update: Hours after the organized demonstration ended, several people, including an Asbury Park Press reporter were arrested. One grassroots organization, Our Revolution Monmouth County NJ, gave an estimate that about 4,000 people turned out for the protest to demand justice for George Floyd and an end to police brutality. When a large crowd still lingered an hour past the 8 p.m. curfew that the city announced Monday, some protesters urged those remaining to ""go in peace"" and asked that there be no escalation to dilute the message of the day's event, as captured by a Youtube live stream by Time to Change-Jersey Style reporter Jennifer Coombs. Warning that the following live stream video contains profanity. Images posted to social media showed police officers calmly standing along the road as marchers passed. A group of officers kneeled at one point, as captured by The DOPE Blog on Instagram and by another attendee on Twitter. Jack McLoone, who works for Asbury Park Press, tweeted about a ""sequence of events"" where someone slashed a tire on a cop car. He said police and the crowd managed to quell the situation as the person was removed for processing. An Asbury Park police officer spoke to the crowd after a protester was arrested, as captured on video by another attendee, Gianna Mehes. It was not immediately confirmed that it was the same individual accused of slashing a tire. The officer said protesting was the attendees' right, and he invited the crowd to wait for the person who was arrested, saying he would be out in just a few minutes after paperwork was filed. The officer said those marching could stay put or continue on, but police would help protect the crowd either way. The crowd assembled along West Bangs Avenue for 5 p.m., where it was addressed by several speakers, including former Asbury Park Mayor Myra Campbell. Then, the crowd marched in the streets, down Cookman and Ocean Avenues and onto the boardwalk, before turning onto 5th Avenue and back toward the west side of Asbury Park, largely along Route 71, or Main Street. A lingering group of protesters was near the Asbury Park Police Department well after 9 p.m., based on social media photos and video clips, as officers stood out among those who remained. Asbury Park was among at least six communities in New Jersey that enacted curfews Monday night, to try and maintain peace after violence that erupted in both Atlantic City and Trenton Sunday evening. The vast majority of demonstrations in New Jersey over the weekend ended peacefully. More from New Jersey 101.5:",0.0

Rockland/Westchester Journal News As the sun dropped below the horizon in New York City Monday night, largely peaceful protests were pocked by moments of lawlessness, as looters ransacked stores along Fifth Avenue, reigning anarchy along one of the most famous retail stretches in the nation. In midtown, looters attacked the Microsoft store at 53rd street and 5th Avenue. Eight looters left the store carrying large hard drives. They ran to a white BMW and a black Mercedes, parked on 53rd Street. They dropped the equipment into the trunks of the cars, climbed in, and drove off. It appeared to be a planned operation. At 9:15, a full ten minutes after the Microsoft store was looted, two dozen police officers sprinted west on 53rd Street toward 5th Avenue. A group of people, some of whom had been looting the store, others who had not, turned and ran. The police caught the slowest ones. Three people were slammed to the sidewalk, and handcuffed using twist ties.

While protests across American cities were marked by considerable unrest, Monday's rallies in Essex County remained peaceful, with little to no confrontation between demonstrators and police officers. In Newark, a crowd of more than 50 gathered outside of Newark City Hall on Broad Street to hold a peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. The crowd chanted, ""Peace.""

Story continues after gallery Meanwhile, just three towns over in the comparatively provincial suburb of Livingston, a rally came together at the intersection of Mount Pleasant and Livingston avenues in the plaza of a mixed-use development, where demonstrators waved signs and passing cars honked in support as drivers traversed the busy intersection. That protest was organized by Emily and Alexander Herbst, Livingston natives. Emily says she suggested the idea to her brother Saturday night after witnessing a mother and daughter hold signs at a Dunkin' Donuts in West Orange. Alexander was uninterested in a two-person demonstration, but if more could be corralled, he was in. A hurried word of mouth campaign gathered about 20 people at the plaza Sunday evening.

Protests made headlines over the past week, as demonstrators often aimed their sights on responding officers, leading to violent clashes that recalled uprisings like that of 1992 in Los Angeles or in 1967 in Newark.

Early in Sunday's Livingston protest, Alexander said, there was a tense moment with a community member who disagreed with the group's message. ""Right away an officer came and said I’m here to have your back,"" Alexander recalled. However, Emily wished the officers could do more for her movement than keep the peace.

However, in early May a video of the shooting emerged showing that the McMichaels were waiting in the middle of the street for Arbery and armed in the moments before the fatal confrontation. On May 7, two days after the video emerged, and more than two months after Arbery's murder, the both were arrested and charged with murder and aggravated assault. Two weeks later the man who filmed the shooting was also arrested for felony murder. Here is Adams' full statement: Andy Vasquez is the Jets beat writer for NorthJersey.com.

It’s one of several demonstrations that have taken place across New Jersey after the death of Floyd, who was killed after an officer knelt a knee on his neck for about nine minutes. About 200 protesters remained by 9:30 p.m., when police began attempting to disperse the crowd. Asbury Park earlier in the day announced a curfew for 8 p.m. Monday, which will conclude at 5 a.m. Tuesday. The protest started at 5 p.m. “We want police to be fair with us, just like they are fair with other cultures. We just want a chance too,"" Jean Gue of Ocean Township, who grew up in Asbury Park, said. “If you’re going to arrest us, arrest us the proper way. We don’t want to die while we’re getting arrested. We don’t want to die while getting pulled over. We just want justice,” Gue said. Former Asbury Park Mayor Myra Campbell, the city’s first first female, African American mayor, addressed the crowd. “Don’t give up. Be consistent. Don’t give up, ever, because that’s the only way you will make progress in this movement,” she said.

Though billed as a speaking event, participants began marching after about an hour. The main organizer, Felicia Simmons, had urged everyone to stay by the post office steps. Some were saying, “hand ups, don’t shoot,” as they walked down a street, and eventually toward the boardwalk. On Main Street, police officers from several departments — including Ocean Township, Belmar, Fair Haven Rumson, and the county prosecutor’s office — knelt with protesters, eliciting applause. When a few protesters began yelling at officers lined up outside the police station, other protesters began shouting, “keep the peace.” Demonstrations in New Jersey’s largest cities have been mostly peaceful with protestors doing a line dance in the middle of the street in Newark, and the police chief marching alongside residents and helping them hold a banner in Camden. But both Trenton and Atlantic City became hotbeds for looting and vandalism Sunday night, hours after peaceful protests ended. More than 60 businesses were vandalized in Trenton, causing hundreds of thousands in damage. And in Atlantic City, 17 people were arrested after windows were smashed in and merchandise was stolen from clothing stores at the Tanger Outlets.

Marc Repace, who worked as a dispatcher, submitted his resignation Monday after the Facebook exchange came to light. “He was immediately suspended once we identified the post as coming from him,” John Hagerty, Woodbridge Township spokesman, told NJ Advance Media. He said Repace resigned after an official review of the Facebook messages. In the messages, Repace comments on a photo taken Friday of a child at a Boston protest of police brutality and racial injustice. The protest was one of many that have taken place across the country following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a black man, was killed as police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. In a video of the encounter, Floyd said multiple times that he could not breathe. The police dispatcher’s comments can be seen in screenshots of a Facebook exchange between Repace and an anonymous Woodbridge resident that have since been deleted but circulated by other locals. In the exchange, Repace reacts to the photo of the 8-year-old boy. In the photo, the boy, who is black, holds a sign that says, “At what age do I go from handsome to a threat?” “17 give or take a year or two,” Repace said in his reply to the photo. “LMFAO totally kidding.” “You are absolutely disgusting,” the anonymous resident replied. “You were in the military and now you work for the Woodbridge Police Department you fit the stereotype. I honestly don’t understand how you can be making jokes at a time like this when the country is completely divided.” Marc Repace, a dispatcher for Woodbridge Township Police, was suspended after residents began sharing screenshots of his recent Facebook messages. Repace commented on a photo of a boy at a Boston protest of police brutality. Screenshots: Facebook/anonymous; original protest photo: Nick Emmons | WBZ-TV The police department acknowledged Repace’s comment Sunday in a Facebook post. “The Woodbridge Police Department is saddened and dismayed by a recent social media post attributed to one of its civilian employees,” the statement said. “Immediate action has been taken to discipline the employee. The Woodbridge Police Department does not condone this type of behavior from any of its personnel and is dedicated to the fair and impartial administration of justice for every member of our community.” The photo of the boy was taken on Boston’s South End by Nick Emmons, an anchor for WBZ-TV, who tweeted the image the same day. On Sunday, Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and CEO of The King Center, included the photo in a tweet. “It pains me that the answer to his question is that racist minds, racist systems and racist America consider him ‘born a threat,’” King said of the boy.

Update: Hours after the organized demonstration ended, several people, including an Asbury Park Press reporter were arrested. One grassroots organization, Our Revolution Monmouth County NJ, gave an estimate that about 4,000 people turned out for the protest to demand justice for George Floyd and an end to police brutality. When a large crowd still lingered an hour past the 8 p.m. curfew that the city announced Monday, some protesters urged those remaining to ""go in peace"" and asked that there be no escalation to dilute the message of the day's event, as captured by a Youtube live stream by Time to Change-Jersey Style reporter Jennifer Coombs. Warning that the following live stream video contains profanity. Images posted to social media showed police officers calmly standing along the road as marchers passed. A group of officers kneeled at one point, as captured by The DOPE Blog on Instagram and by another attendee on Twitter. Jack McLoone, who works for Asbury Park Press, tweeted about a ""sequence of events"" where someone slashed a tire on a cop car. He said police and the crowd managed to quell the situation as the person was removed for processing. An Asbury Park police officer spoke to the crowd after a protester was arrested, as captured on video by another attendee, Gianna Mehes. It was not immediately confirmed that it was the same individual accused of slashing a tire. The officer said protesting was the attendees' right, and he invited the crowd to wait for the person who was arrested, saying he would be out in just a few minutes after paperwork was filed. The officer said those marching could stay put or continue on, but police would help protect the crowd either way. The crowd assembled along West Bangs Avenue for 5 p.m., where it was addressed by several speakers, including former Asbury Park Mayor Myra Campbell. Then, the crowd marched in the streets, down Cookman and Ocean Avenues and onto the boardwalk, before turning onto 5th Avenue and back toward the west side of Asbury Park, largely along Route 71, or Main Street. A lingering group of protesters was near the Asbury Park Police Department well after 9 p.m., based on social media photos and video clips, as officers stood out among those who remained. Asbury Park was among at least six communities in New Jersey that enacted curfews Monday night, to try and maintain peace after violence that erupted in both Atlantic City and Trenton Sunday evening. The vast majority of demonstrations in New Jersey over the weekend ended peacefully. More from WOBM News:",0.0

Krasner also sought to assuage concerns that police might intimidate would-be voters from approaching polling places. Officers, he said, are prohibited under Pennsylvania law from being within 100 feet of a polling place, unless they’re specifically called there to quell some kind of disturbance. Deeley added that if there are, in fact, disturbances that render polling places inoperable, the city is working with the Pennsylvania Department of State to come up with contingency plans. She declined to say what those plans might be, and said they’d only be rolled out if necessary. A Department of State spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information. David Thornburgh, who heads the election watchdog group the Committee of Seventy, said even before the events of the last few months, he was expecting relatively low turnout. With the presidential primary decided well before Pennsylvania’s election, he noted, there were few “marquee” races left. “With each succeeding wave of anxiety and concern — pandemic, civil unrest — you chip away a few percentage points,” Thornburgh said. “So it’s probably going to be an even lower-turnout election, which is not good for democracy.” He’s not the only one thinking along those lines. Even prior to the wave of civil unrest, Philadelphia political leaders were anticipating a steep dropoff at the polls. Democratic City Committee Chairman Bob Brady said the limited number of polling locations and fears over spreading the new coronavirus were a recipe for low turnout. In past elections, Brady’s ward in Philadelphia’s Overbrook section boasted 42 polling locations. Then, after city election officials slashed locations citywide by nearly 80% in response to the pandemic, it dropped to just five locations. “I don’t think many people are gonna come out,” Brady said Saturday. “I’m telling my committee people: There’s no reason to go to the polls.” But Brady also criticized the mail-in ballot process, which he called discriminatory against older voters. He said he pushed to allow for dropoff of mail-in ballots at local polling places on primary day, instead of at a limited number of sanctioned drop-box locations. But there were legal obstacles, he said. “Why can’t you take that ballot to poll?” he asked. “You take your ass to the poll, you can’t take your ballot? Take your ballot with your ass.” Thornburgh estimated that restrictions notwithstanding, around 60 to 70% of votes cast in Philadelphia will be by mail. That’s only possible thanks to Pennsylvania’s newly-expanded election code, which allows voters to cast ballots by mail without an excuse, and gives them more time to return those ballots. As far as Thornburgh is concerned, that’s a good thing. But state and county officials have also periodically raised concerns about the commonwealth’s new election logistics. County election offices are now dealing with huge increases in the number of mail-in ballots they have to process, and have said for months that the extra work — along with the brand-new voting machines many counties are using for the first time — could slow down results. Officials could not immediately be reached to respond to Wolf’s last-minute deadline extension, but it will likely give them more time to tally ballots. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Monday that she has been closely in touch with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, and will be monitoring protests and other issues “hour by hour.” “We will absolutely inform the public of any changes as soon as we become aware of any,” she said. “So far, there are no changes that have been identified at this point.” Philly suburbs predict ‘normal proceedings’ Philadelphia isn’t the only place that has been dealing with unrest on top of existing, pandemic-related election challenges. Protests broke out sporadically across the counties that surround the city and in some cases, became contentious, In Montgomery County, which saw looting at the King of Prussia Mall, Public Affairs Manager Terresa Harris said that county commissioners “had no concerns about civil unrest at the polling places.” She said they would operate as planned Tuesday, with no additional precautions. The same goes for Delaware County. On Sunday, local media outlets reported a large police presence in Upper Darby as businesses were looted and vandalized. But a county spokesperson said that would not affect in-person voting sites set to operate during Tuesday’s primary. “As of this afternoon, those locations do feel confident that they can have normal proceedings,” said Adrienne Marofsky, Director of Public Relations for Delaware County. She added that law enforcement will be monitoring. In Bucks County, constables will be monitoring polling sites. “You can’t really station a police officer inside a polling place, legally,” county spokesperson Larry King noted. The other issue election officials are bracing for are masks, which are required at polling stations. King said workers there will have additional masks on hand for people who do not have one, and are adding additional measures for residents to cast votes if they cannot, or will not, don a protective mask. “They’re not going to be denied the right to vote, obviously,” King said.",0.0

Help us report on the pandemic. As hundreds gather each day across Philadelphia to protest the death of George Floyd, allegedly murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, Philly and its surrounding counties are poised to move from the state-designated “red” phase of coronavirus shutdown to the less restrictive “yellow” phase. Despite the rules against large gatherings in both phases, city and state officials have signaled that, as of now, Philadelphia will stay the course. “The plan is for red counties, including Philadelphia, to move to yellow on Friday,” Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said Monday. It will likely take a week or two to see how the ongoing protests over Floyd’s death will affect the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the protests aren’t the first instances of large crowds gathering in violation of Philadelphia’s stay-at-home order. Across the state over Memorial Day weekend, public health officials worried that celebrations among stir-crazy Pennsylvanians would cause an uptick in coronavirus cases and slow the progress the commonwealth has made in mitigating the spread of the virus. Over the next few days, the city might start to see such an increase, said Philadelphia Health Department spokesman James Garrow. Though Mondays have been slow days for test results throughout the pandemic because of weekend lag times at labs, he said the day’s 252 positive tests showed no sign of an uptick yet. City Health Commissioner Thomas Farley has consistently said that moving into the “Safer at Home” phase scheduled for Friday will depend on a variety of data points, including hospital space, testing capacity, and new positive case numbers. The testing metrics could be affected by the shrinking number of testing sites due to the protests: On Monday and Tuesday, all city testing sites and community health centers were set to be closed as a part of the shutdown of all city services. Several pharmacies, such as CVS and Rite Aid, also closed locations, further reducing the number of test sites in Philly. If the number of tests drops substantially, that could affect the plan, according to Garrow, as could a spike in cases that would likely be a result of Memorial Day activities. “Based on what we’re seeing, the mayor and Health Department will make that decision in the next few days, and in coordination with Governor Wolf,” he said. As of now, the state will stick with the plan for Philadelphia’s transition to “yellow” on Friday, along with all the other remaining “red” counties in the state.",0.0

Rutgers basketball is returning to campus soon — with a commitment to Covid-19 safety and social justice causes. Head coach Steve Pikiell addressed the twin issues of the pandemic and unrest over the killing of George Floyd during a Monday videoconference with reporters. After having a conversation with Gov. Phil Murphy, Pikiell said his players will be able to return to campus June 22 for individual workouts and instruction.

""It’s awful and wrong and I want our program, not just me, I want our staff and the people associated with our program to be active and do a great job with creating change.

But I want our program to be active in that — not just putting out statements. To be active in trying to make the word a better place. I want to make sure we're a program that just doesn’t talk it. That we walk it.” “We are in a country right now where we need to do better. What has happened is wrong and I want to be part of a change in making things right.” The coach spoke of ways his program ""can affect change"" and mentioned potential partnerships with the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on campus and the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice in Newark. “There are some really good resources here in New Jersey,"" he said. ""Our players have talked about a lot of different things (regarding) voting and fundraising and using our visibility as a program. Change has to happen and we all have to be a part of that, from basketball coaches to teachers to regular people in the community and media.” Pikiell said he wants his players to be deeply involved in the direction this takes and stressed that he'll be listening to their ideas intently. “We want to be at the forefront of the change,"" he said. On returning to campus Switching gears to the coronavirus pandemic, Pikiell became the first Rutgers coach to announce a return date for athletes. “The second summer session is starting up here June 22; we’ve been targeting that date with our guys,"" he said. ""It’s voluntary. But to get them back would be good, and I think they’re ready to come back.” That return will be accompanied by a slew of protocols, most of which are still being worked out. “We’re going to test them (for Covid-19) a lot,"" he said. ""We’re still working on the details. I just know it’s going to be constant while they’re on campus just to keep everybody safe.” These will not be full-scale practices. They will be individual instruction workouts with a player and coach, team meetings and weight-room sessions. There will be a wide range of safety procedures, Pikiell said, including, “The way you come in the building, temperature checks when you come in, filling out forms on how you feel today, a lot of things…from the cleaning of the basketball to how many people can be in the weight room.” He said the players will utilize outdoor space at the RWJBarnabas Health Athletic Performance Center (APC). The weight room opens to the outdoors, and there are patio areas as well. “We have a nice outdoor setup so we can have meetings outdoors, too, which we’ve done in the past,"" he said. ""Our facility I feel is more well-equipped to handle this pandemic than the RAC would have been.” Having player development time in the offseason is crucial for any program but especially for Rutgers, because it's been a forte of Pikiell, who has built an NCAA Tournament contender out of a roster of mostly under-the-radar recruits. “I’m hoping July 1 that they can go back to eight hours of individual instruction (per week),"" he said. ""I’m not worried about (restrictions on) contact right now. That will come later. We can do things individually without contact. We can get shots up outside.

And then it became clear. President Trump wanted to walk from the White House through the park to the Episcopal church. Camera crews scrambled to keep up with him as he strode through the park, followed by his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, along with Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials. Trump stopped briefly outside the church and held up a Bible. “We have the greatest country in the world,” he said. “Keep it nice and safe.” The impromptu visit came just after Trump delivered remarks at the White House, declaring himself “your president of law and order” and demanding that governors deploy National Guard units and “dominate the streets.” St. John’s Church opened in 1816 and is known as “the Church of the Presidents,” having hosted every U.S. president since James Madison. On this occasion, however, the president’s visit was unannounced, and church authorities were furious that the White House did not bother to alert them beforehand. “There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,” said The Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Episcopal Bishop of Washington, with oversight responsibilities for the church. When the president held up the Bible, without praying or quoting a verse appropriate for the moment, Budde was further incensed. “It almost looked like a prop,” she told NPR. “That is the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks messages of love, of God, love of neighbor. I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way.” The Bible teaches us to love God and our neighbor; that all people are beloved children of God; that we are to do justice and love kindness. The President used our sacred text as a symbol of division. — Mariann Budde (@Mebudde) June 2, 2020 The church has long been known for its support of social justice causes, and in the hours before the president showed up, clergy and lay volunteers had been ministering to the protesters in the plaza. Protests, some of them violent, had occurred around the church on previous nights, and the church was briefly in danger on Sunday after a fire started in the church basement. A former St. John’s minister, Gini Gerbasi, was among those attending to the protesters in front of the church when the police moved in. “We were literally DRIVEN OFF of the St. John’s, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “PEOPLE WERE HURT SO THAT [President Trump] COULD HAVE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH!!! HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO STEP OVER THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES WE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE WERE BEING TEAR GASSED!!!!” In a statement Monday evening, the Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joined in the criticism of Trump’s visit. “This evening, the President of the United States stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, lifted up a bible, and had pictures of himself taken,” Curry said. “In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us.” The church visit was praised, however, by a member of Trump’s Evangelical Advisory Board, the Rev. Johnnie Moore. “I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly & in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,” Moore tweeted.",0.0

Trump returns to 2016 theme as violence spreads after George Floyd death,http://rssfeeds.northjersey.com/~/625849408/0/northjerseynews~Law-and-order-Trump-returns-to-theme-as-violence-spreads-after-George-Floyd-death/,en,False,,65,"The Record - Hackensack,NJ ",http://www.northjersey.com/,"WASHINGTON – At the Kennedy Space Center over the weekend, President Donald Trump reflected the crises facing his administration: Acknowledging the ""pain"" felt by millions of Americans, he called for ""healing, not hatred."" Forty-eight hours later, as peaceful protesters were cleared from a park near the White House, the president stood in the Rose Garden, described himself as ""your president of law and order"" and demanded local officials ""dominate the streets"" – or else. The whipsaw shift in tone underscored a change of direction from the White House and its conservative allies: The increasingly confrontational demonstrations taking place across the USA, observers said, have given Trump an opportunity to reprise his get-tough approach to law enforcement from the 2016 campaign. ""We’re not going to solve our issues of racial inequality or feelings of economic hopelessness brought on by the coronavirus pandemic overnight, but we can stop the riots and protests with bold, definitive and unapologetic action,"" said Jason Miller, who served as a senior communication adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign. The president brandished that message with a high degree of drama and controversy Monday, appearing in the Rose Garden as Secret Service and police swiftly cleared an adjacent park of protesters. Trump then strolled through the park to stand outside historic St. John's Church, which had been vandalized the night before. On Twitter Tuesday, Trump touted what he said was ""overwhelming force"" and ""domination"" of protesters in D.C. Critics, including some Republicans, described the visit to St. John's church as a ""photo-op"" and a ""stunt"" designed to give the president an image of walking through Lafayette Square that was widely shared by his supporters on social media. Though there has been violence and rowdiness in the same park in recent days, reporters observing the events and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said the demonstrations were calm for hours leading up to their abrupt removal. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who occasionally criticizes Trump, slammed the president not only for clearing the park but also holding up a Bible when he arrived at St. John's Episcopal Church near the White House. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property and no right to throw rocks at police,"" Sasse said. ""But there is a fundamental – a constitutional – right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop."" Sasse was not alone in that assessment. ""Anybody that protests something like that peacefully should not be impeded either,"" said Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind. ""So that it's a tough call because you're in the moment and it all gets a little blurry but we got to do better at that."" Many Trump supporters viewed the walk across Lafayette Square as a moment of strength and a demonstration of the president's resolve to end the violence ripping through American cities. They questioned media coverage of the park's clearing and, in particular, reporting that tear gas was deployed. The U.S. Park Police said in a statement Tuesday that its officers issued three warnings over a loudspeaker to alert demonstrators to evacuate the area. As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, the statement said, officers used smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by the Park Police or other law enforcement to close the area around Lafayette Park, the agency said. Trump's walk to St. John's, which was damaged by fire a day earlier as protests turned violent, followed reports that he had been hurried into an underground bunker at the White House as protests built Friday – an episode that drew a storm of criticism. Trump, who frequently describes his political opponents as ""weak"" and who uses the 1978 song ""Macho Man"" in the playlist at campaign and official events, wanted to pay his respects to the church but also wanted to leave the White House to prove he was not ""in the bunker,"" said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s strategy. Trump's display drew fierce criticism from Democrats, who noted that at the exact moment the president was describing himself as an ""ally"" of peaceful protesters, military police were clearing a park of protesters who were demonstrating without incident. The criticism did not deter Trump from visiting a Catholic shrine across town Tuesday, a trip that was slammed by a top church official, Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. In 2016, Trump repeatedly described himself as ""the law and order candidate"" as the nation was wrestling with many of the same questions about police use of force and the targeting of African Americans as it is now. ""We must maintain law and order at the highest level, or we will cease to have a country,"" Trump said in the summer of 2016 during an address in Virginia. The president returned to that message in a call with governors Monday, calling them ""weak"" and arguing they needed to ""dominate"" the ""radicals"" and ""anarchists"" he said were behind the violence. Using blunt language, Trump urged the governors to crack down hard on violent protests in dozens of cities. In another example of that more aggressive messaging, White House officials said this week that the president was considering invoking an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. Known as the Insurrection Act, it was last used in 1992 in response to the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Though Trump's core supporters may embrace the more combative approach, outside observers noted that it carries risk. Federal and state officials traditionally seek to lower the temperature when unrest breaks out, not raise it. It's possible Trump's remarks could escalate the demonstrations. Washington officials reported more than 300 arrests Monday, most for curfew violations. Trump has largely side-stepped the protests' underlying issues. He said the nation is ""sickened and revolted"" by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis – and he promised justice for Floyd's family – but he stopped short of addressing the systemic concerns of racism and disparate use of force that sparked the anger. ""You have an upset nation,"" said James Williams, 49, an African American who attended the demonstration Monday at Lafayette Square, along with his wife and 14-year-old son. Williams, an engineer from suburban Virginia – a battleground area in the presidential election – also participated in Sunday's protest. ""I came to see how everyone else feels about the injustice that is being done to African American people,"" Williams said, adding that the country's law enforcement system is ""not the same for African Americans as it is for white Americans."" Democratic strategist Jim Manley said he was not convinced that running on a platform of law and order was necessarily going to help Trump much. ""His base will love it, but given his propensity to overreach, he will just turn off the swing voters in the suburbs."" Matt Mackowiak, a GOP political consultant, was one of several Republicans who suggested Trump could bind the nation's wounds with a formal address, perhaps from the Oval Office. Mackowiak spoke with USA TODAY before the president's remarks Monday. ""I believe a national address would be helpful if the president spoke to the intense anger over the senseless Floyd killing and urged calm and nonviolent protest,"" he said. ""I believe the silent majority sympathizes with anger over the Floyd killing while they are also horrified at the rioting and looting."" Some Republican lawmakers sharpened their criticism of the president's tone during the unrest. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said some of Trump's ""tweets have not been helpful."" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who faces a tough reelection, said the president should highlight ""the fact that we need to work on the underlying racial injustice in this country, but we need to do so in a peaceful manner."" Administration officials indicated Monday that Trump believes he has spoken sufficiently on the topic and that his goal would be to take actions to promote security. That approach is more in Trump's wheelhouse: setting up fights not only with those protesters who are causing trouble but also Democratic mayors in the besieged cities. Through the highs and lows of his presidency, Trump's polling has remained consistent – underscoring a conventional wisdom that most Americans have made up their mind about him. It's not clear that Trump could ""heal"" a highly polarized nation, several observers said, even if he wanted to. ""This is heartbreaking. The divide in our homes and among our friends is now on the streets,"" veteran GOP consultant Frank Luntz told USA TODAY before Trump's visit to St. John's. ""But politically, I understand why he's remained quiet. The people he needs to address don't want to hear him, and his base is appalled at the looting."" The unrest and angst, much of it driven by racial tension, has prompted comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran for president in part on a ""law and order"" platform after race riots prompted by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Matt Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University who has studied social crises, said the comparison to the 1960s works only to a point. Americans, he noted, were also angry with President Lyndon Johnson's handling of Vietnam. ""I do think there’s an interesting echo in that Lyndon Johnson was in many ways the author of his own defeat,"" Dallek said. But Johnson had already removed himself from the race in 1968. And Trump, Dallek said, has already run a campaign focused on law and order. ""What (Trump) really promised was a restoration of order, and what we've seen is really the opposite,"" Dallek said. ""In many ways, he's inflamed an already bad situation."" Contributing: Caren Bohan, Christal Hayes, Nicholas Wu",0.0

Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General Bill Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was “strongly looking for arrests.” “You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,” the president said. “If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren’t dominating, you’re wasting your time,” he said. “They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.” “It’s a movement, if you don’t put it down it will get worse and worse,” Trump said. “The only time it’s successful is when you’re weak and most of you are weak.” The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president urged in a Rose Garden address that the governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said. In the nation’s capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already “dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property.” While some governors, such as South Carolina’s Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump’s calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president’s combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president’s remarks “dangerous” and said they should be “gravely concerning to all Americans.” The president’s comments, she said, “send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction.” “We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,” Whitmer said in a statement. “This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation’s history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another.” The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn’t surprised by the president’s “incendiary words.” “At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,” he said following the phone call with Trump. “Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston, it’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts,” he said as his voice cracked with emotion, “and it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president’s remarks the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying “Thank you, but no thank you.” “He wants to make this about looting because he doesn’t want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,” Cuomo said. “[He] doesn’t want to really talk about racism and discrimination.” In the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the “rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,” to which Trump snapped back, “I don’t like your rhetoric that much either.” Pritzker, speaking later on CNN, remarked: “Well, it’s illegal. He can’t do it. We won’t request military assistance here in the state of Illinois. I can’t imagine why any governor is going to do that. This is, it’s ridiculous,” he said. Should the officers in Breonna Taylor case be fired? Beshear says he was among first to call for independent probe. There are “major concerns” about the one officer who shot through her apartment windows, he says. He does not answer the question outright. — Marcus Green (@MarcusGreenWDRB) June 1, 2020 Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a “no knock” warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota’s Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota “a laughingstock all over the world.” Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: “No one’s laughing here. We’re in pain. We’re crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.”",0.0

The line has clearly been crossed in recent days for many from this being about racism and change to an easy opportunity for others to clash with police, loot and cause damage from New York to Seattle. Curfews have done little to stem the violent outbreaks and there seems to be no end in sight even as President Trump threatens to use military force if necessary to seize control of cities. The president finally spoke out on the protests late yesterday and as is often the case with him did not attempt to unite the country but rather delivered a stern warning that he will not tolerate a lack of action in curbing the violence. He took plenty of shots at the nation’s governors for not seizing control of their states and basically said if they can’t do it he will. He followed that up by having police break up a peaceful protest in Washington D.C. before the curfew so he could walk across the street and pose for a picture holding a bible in front of a damaged church. I certainly agree that we cannot allow violent protests, looting and destruction to continue but this is a time in our nation where we need more than tough talk and tear gas. Police officers are being put in almost impossible situations, wanting for the most part to protect and serve but really not sure exactly how to do so. The problem is a lack of leadership and it starts with President Trump who has to embrace the peaceful protests and work in conjunction with governors, mayors, police and other civic leaders to find some common ground here. They need a unified approach to tackling this problem and that has clearly not been the case. America is a ticking time bomb right now and frankly it’s damn scary.",0.0

Asbury Park Press Like the many journalists harassed during George Floyd protests, Gustavo Martínez Contreras was doing his job. New Jersey's leaders must draw a line. At 9:40 p.m. Monday, Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martínez Contreras filmed an extraordinary moment as police and protestors took a knee together during a rally for George Floyd in Asbury Park. Thirty minutes later, Martinez Contreras was being loaded into a police van, detained for doing his job (see the above video). This is happening all over the country and it’s bad for democracy. Real bad. According to the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, U.S. police arrested or attacked journalists more than 100 times from May 28-31, as protests over the killing of George Floyd spread throughout the country. Some perspective on that: Over the last three years, U.S. Press Freedom Tracker documented between 100-150 such incidents per year. Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) So police did a year’s worth of harassing of journalists in four days. Then there were Monday’s incidents: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian T.V. reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. Capping off this spasm of suppression was the arrest of Martinez Contreras. Prior to the rally, Asbury Park officials had expressly exempted media members from the 8 p.m. curfew. Martinez Contreras was filming the post-curfew arrest of protesters and did not appear to be obstructing police at all when an officer approached him and yelled, ""you're under arrest"" and ""get your f---ing hands behind your back."" He was released several hours later with a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse. Later Tuesday morning, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal addressed the matter. ""I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today,"" Grewal wrote on Twitter. ""We will also figure out why this happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. Because in America, we don't lock up reporters for doing their job."" Altogether, the scope of law enforcement’s harassment of the media over the past week might be unprecedented in the history of American journalism. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. That’s a real slippery slope. Locking up and beating down the press is the go-to move of the world’s most repressive regimes. There’s a reason why President Trump repeatedly slams the media as “the enemy.” It’s a pesky check on government power. His attempts at demonization appear to be working. Now is the time for responsible leaders in New Jersey to ask questions and demand answers about why a reporter was hauled away for doing his job. Draw a line before this becomes a trend here like it has elsewhere.

Bucks is using machines that require voters to fill out a paper ballot, then feed it into a scanner. County spokesman Larry King said commissioners don’t yet know the scale of the problem, but have seen sporadic issues at polling places across the county that have affected ballots for both parties. The solution, he said, is rudimentary: Commissioners have instructed judges of elections to have their poll workers simply cut a sliver off of the ballot with scissors or a paper cutter, which usually solves the problem. Officials believe the issue is the fault of the vendor in charge of printing the ballots, Reliance Graphics. King said he voted in person in Doylestown this morning and noticed that his own ballot was a little wide for the scanner. He eventually forced it in, and the machine accepted it. He added, county officials have instructed judges of elections who aren’t able to cut down ill-fitting ballots to place them in an emergency ballot box, which will be brought to the county elections office in Doylestown and tallied there. Too-big ballots aren’t the only factor adding an element of chaos to Bucks’ election. Late last week, county officials submitted an emergency petition to the county’s Court of common Pleas, asking for voters to get more time to return mail-in ballots due to sluggish mail. The judge, James McMaster, is expected to issue a decision Tuesday afternoon. Bucks, which has so far seen largely peaceful protests, wasn’t included in Gov. Wolf’s order extending the deadline to return mail-in ballots. “I guess we weren’t violent enough,” King said. He said officials are hoping Wolf’s deadline extension in the six other counties will sway the judge to rule in Bucks’ favor. Poll workers report good turnout in West Philly Despite predictions of low turnout, the scene at polling places around West Philadelphia was generally unaffected by coronavirus fears or worries of depressed turnout from citywide civil unrest, poll workers said. “With all the rallies, all the disease, I’m happy to see the turnout,” said Marvin Robinson, 4th ward committee person, from Universal Bluford Charter. “With the riots going on, I didn’t even think we were going to have an election, but thank God that the people believe in their democracy.” Lines inside at James Rhoads School and Heston School, and socially distant lines outside the School of the Future, were a result of consolidated polling places, but also unusually high turnout. “It’s more people coming out on the primary,” said the judge of elections, Katherine Gambrell. “It’s higher than it normally would be this time a day just for my one division.” By about 11:30 a.m., 131 people had voted in the 6th ward 15th division. There were some hiccups. Gambrell said she arrived at her polling place at 6:15 a.m. to no tables or chairs. There was also no guidance about how to combine polling places, which caused confusion. Jacqueline Brower showed up to her normal voting location at Heston School near 54th Street and Lancaster Avenue, only to be told her polling place had been moved. Sandra Williams, judge of elections at that location, called a voting hotline and helped Brower learn where she should vote. That happened at locations across West Philly, poll workers said. Some voters downplay coronavirus concerns If Pennsylvania’s primary election had been held last month, Plymouth Meeting resident Kathie McDade wouldn’t have been willing to vote in person. “But I’m getting a little more comfortable now that the [COVID-19] numbers are going down, so I’d rather do it in person,” she told WHYY reporter Ximena Conde earlier today while voting at Central Montco Technical High School. Some of the voters who showed up said they weren’t too concerned about the health risks posed by voting in person. “I feel like we are pretty safe where we are,” said Claire Ward, who voted at Belmont Elementary School in Lower Merion Township. “We live, maybe, five blocks from here and I feel like the whole pandemic thing is a little overdone.” Donna Kelly is the judge of elections at Central Montco Technical High School. Only one precinct was added to the school, for a total of three, though a staffing shortage and steady stream of voters kept poll workers busy. “This doesn’t seem to be terribly different from other primaries,” said Kelly. “Probably 10% of our voters did mail-in. Here we probably see 25% turnout during primaries, so it’s looking like it’s running about the same for us.” Sanitizing the clipboards was the only minor delay voters reported, but Kelly said it hasn’t posed a problem for those casting ballots. “People are understanding that we might not be able to rush them through,” she said. Poll workers report early difficulties As the morning unfolded in the Philadelphia area, poll workers reported low turnout and some technical issues. “It’s just a mess in here,” said Geneva Carter, a longtime election judge who was stationed at Vare Recreation Center in South Philadelphia on Tuesday morning. “People don’t even know where to vote.” Carter said turnout was about half of what it would normally be. At Belmont Hill Elementary in Montgomery County, WHYY reporter Ximena Conde said the typical, early-morning rush never took place. A voting machine operator also told Conde that younger poll workers had replaced some of the older volunteers who usually work on election day. Robin Kolodny is a voting machine op. here and a polisci prof at Temple. She says the avg. age of those working the polls at this Montco location has dropped.

1623225111,2020-06-02 08:28:07,Watch Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' Speech,https://wobm.com/martin-luther-king-jr-have-dream-speech/,en,False,,442196,wobm.com,http://wobm.com/,"One of America's great civil rights leaders, Martin Luther King, Jr., gave arguably his best known and most often quoted speech, the ""I have a dream"" speech, on Aug. 28, 1963. The March on Washington for jobs and freedom culminated with King speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. King was joined in the march that day by over 250,000 civil rights supporters. It was notable for reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 1863, but, as King stated, ""One hundred years later, the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."" The speech's most often referenced quote, ""I have a dream,"" came as the activist spoke of ""the American dream"" and his hope that one day America would live up to the statement ""that all men are created equal."" King's full speech can be read below, along with video provided below that: I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: ""For Whites Only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ""justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."" I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."" This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning: My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, From every mountainside, let freedom ring! And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!",0.0

Asbury Park Press Like the many journalists harassed during George Floyd protests, Gustavo Martínez Contreras was doing his job. New Jersey's leaders must draw a line. At 9:40 p.m. Monday, Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martínez Contreras filmed an extraordinary moment as police and protestors took a knee together during a rally for George Floyd in Asbury Park. Thirty minutes later, Martinez Contreras was being loaded into a police van, detained for doing his job (see the above video). This is happening all over the country and it’s bad for democracy. Real bad. According to the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, U.S. police arrested or attacked journalists more than 100 times from May 28-31, as protests over the killing of George Floyd spread throughout the country. Some perspective on that: Over the last three years, U.S. Press Freedom Tracker documented between 100-150 such incidents per year. Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) So police did a year’s worth of harassing of journalists in four days. Then there were Monday’s incidents: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian T.V. reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. Capping off this spasm of suppression was the arrest of Martinez Contreras. Prior to the rally, Asbury Park officials had expressly exempted media members from the 8 p.m. curfew. Martinez Contreras was filming the post-curfew arrest of protesters and did not appear to be obstructing police at all when an officer approached him and yelled, ""you're under arrest"" and ""get your f---ing hands behind your back."" He was released several hours later with a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse. Later Tuesday morning, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal addressed the matter. ""I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today,"" Grewal wrote on Twitter. ""We will also figure out why this happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. Because in America, we don't lock up reporters for doing their job."" Altogether, the scope of law enforcement’s harassment of the media over the past week might be unprecedented in the history of American journalism. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. That’s a real slippery slope. Locking up and beating down the press is the go-to move of the world’s most repressive regimes. There’s a reason why President Trump repeatedly slams the media as “the enemy.” It’s a pesky check on government power. His attempts at demonization appear to be working. Now is the time for responsible leaders in New Jersey to ask questions and demand answers about why a reporter was hauled away for doing his job. Draw a line before this becomes a trend here like it has elsewhere.

1623263359,2020-06-02 07:30:03,Incarcerated Artists are Expressing the Urgency of Clemency During COVID-19,https://observer.com/2020/06/incarcerated-artists-clemency-covid-19/,en,False,,1063,Politicker NJ,http://www.politickernj.com/,"Across the country over the last couple of days, people already at the ends of their ropes due to the coronavirus have watched with shock and horror as protesters in major cities have been pepper sprayed, arrested, beaten and shot at by police officers en masse. In the fallout from the death of George Floyd, an uprising of sorts is underway, and millions of dollars have been donated to bail funds so that freshly-jailed demonstrators can be swiftly released from incarceration. On Wednesday, May 27, an online exhibition went live that fits in seamlessly with the energy throbbing through America right now: Open Call for Clemency, the result of a combined effort between The Confined Arts (TCA) and Release Aging People from Prison (RAPP), is a show that features work by artists who’re currently incarcerated nationwide. Curated by Claire Kim, the exhibition emphasizes the urgent need for governors to issue clemencies because of the coronavirus, which has proven itself to be particularly deadly to the prison population and to people over the age of 50. Inmates in New York state prisons have been dying at a rate that’s 3.24 times higher since March 30 than it was for the first three months of 2020, and this statistic indicates that New York’s prisons, which are largely poorly ventilated and broadly unsanitary, are deadly places to be confined during a pandemic. Additionally, according to data gathered by the Legal Aid Society, the infection rate at local New York City jails has been more than seven times higher than the city’s average infection rate, and 87 times higher than the country at large. Therefore, the only way to ensure the safety of incarcerated people and correctional workers is actively and drastically reducing the prison population. The artists featured in Open Call for Clemency have produced work that is wide-ranging in terms of form and execution, and each individual’s astonishing subtlety of expression is offset by the lengthy sentences that they all have in common. Jose “Tony” Medina, an artist who makes delicate creations like baskets and baby shoes by weaving materials like typing paper or vinyl, has been incarcerated for 40 years and is particularly vulnerable to the possibility of COVID-19 infection because he only has one lung; the other he lost to cancer. Artist Solomon Gideon, Jr. created a painting for the exhibition that represents a flag carried by black Americans during the Silent Parade March of 1917, which was a protest against discrimination and violence organized by the NAACP. “My great, great grandfather marched in the Silent Parade, and the message still resonates today,” Gideon, Jr. said in a statement. “People are turning a blind eye to the risk of COVID-19 in New York state prisons, just like they turned a blind eye to the lynchings in the South.” Gideon, Jr. was released from prison in January after serving 42 years of a 25-to-life sentence. Those interested in assisting in the process of urgently reducing the national prison population are encouraged to contact their governors directly, and as nightly protests have continued to lead to widespread arrests, it’s clear that citizen intervention on behalf of incarcerated Americans will need to be ongoing and relentless.",0.0

Asbury Park Press Editor's note: This story was updated to include a statement from Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ. ASBURY PARK - Charges filed against an Asbury Park Press reporter arrested covering Monday night's protest in Asbury Park will be dropped, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday. Grewal apologized for the arrest of reporter Gustavo Martinez Contreras by a city police officer and assured Press Executive Editor Paul D'Ambrosio that there will be an inquiry in the arrest. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D- N.J., also forcefully condemned the arrest. ""We don't arrest reporters in this country and this state for doing their jobs,"" Grewal said. ""We need to do better. We are going to figure out what went wrong here and do better."" Martinez Contreras was arrested while covering a protest in the city over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Earlier: APP reporter arrested at Asbury Park George Floyd protest ""We are better than this,"" Grewal told D'Ambrosio Tuesday morning. ""You (the media) play an important role in everything that is happening right now."" Booker echoed that sentiment in a statement emailed to the Asbury Park Press Tuesday afternoon. “It’s unacceptable to me that journalists like Mr. Contreras are being arrested for doing their job at a time when their work is needed the most,"" Booker said. ""Journalists have been at the forefront of movements for social justice by telling the truth as it needs to be told. While charges have been dropped against Mr. Conteras, incidents like this send a chilling message that runs counter to our values as Americans.” The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. Grewal said the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office would be ""working as fast as they can to dismiss the charges"" and ""we want to make sure this doesn't happen moving forward."" The Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office later announced that the charge was dismissed. A copy of the request to dismiss the complaint alleged that Martinez Contreras ""failed to identify as a reporter."" Martinez Contreras disputed that: He said he identified himself to officers who handcuffed, transported and questioned him, and took down his information at the Belmar Police Department, where he was processed. ""I told the few officers I had interactions with, and I was wearing my (identification) badge all the time,"" Martinez Contreras said. Last night, an @AsburyParkPress reporter was arrested while covering protests.  I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today. — AG Gurbir Grewal (@NewJerseyOAG) June 2, 2020 Martinez Contreras was live streaming the protest and a police arrest when, according to the video, a police officer told him to move back. Martinez Contreras began retreating, before an officer shouted ""f--- him, he's the problem"" and tackled Martinez Contreras to the ground. ""You're under arrest,"" the officer says. ""put your f---ing hands behind your back."" Just before the encounter, Martinez Contreras had filmed police throw a man to a curb and a woman to the ground. They were siblings and both were juveniles, Martinez Contreras said. ""That's what I was seeing,"" Martinez Contreras said. ""In my mind, I kind of remember the moment but I was more focused on what was happening to those kids."" Editorial: Reporters must not be charged or detained as they cover demonstrations ""The arrest is an outrageous affront to the First Amendment and Gustavo’s rights as a citizen. We will fight this abuse of power aggressively,"" D'Ambrosio said shortly after Gustavo's release. ""Gustavo was doing his job, chronicling the chaos in the city and filming an aggressive arrest by an officer. Once you see the video, the only conclusion you can come to is that another officer didn’t want anyone to film the arrest and took Gustavo down without asking questions."" Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) Martinez Contreras was handcuffed and transported by van to the Belmar Police Department, where he remained in police custody for about five hours. A plainclothes Belmar police officer asked him multiple questions about Antifa, an anti-fascist movement that has become a target of President Donald Trump, blaming the movement, without evidence, for riots and looting across the country. ""I think they thought I was Antifa,"" Martinez Contreras said. ""He asked me if I knew what Antifa was, if I had come with Antifa people or I'd seen Antifa people in the protest."" Trump last week announced his intention to declare Antifa a ""terrorist organization,"" despite the movement having no official organization or leaders. Martinez Conteras said he was asked by officers if he was aware Antifa was a terrorist organization, Mullen said. Martinez Contreras's arrest was another entry in what has been a particularly violent week for journalists covering the aftermath of Floyd's death. From May 28 through May 31, police arrested or attacked journalists over 100 times during protests over Floyd's death and police misconduct in general. In the previous three years, the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reported 100 to 150 incidents each year. Throughout much of the evening, the Asbury Park protest was peaceful. Nearly 1,000 protesters gathered at the post office on Bangs Avenue, where numerous speakers spoke to the crowd through a megaphone about the death of Floyd and other unarmed black people who died in encounters with police. Police provided traffic control as the protesters marched across the city, down Cookman Avenue and out to the boardwalk. An hour before the protest began, Asbury Park Mayor John Moor signed an emergency declaration imposing an 8 p.m. curfew. Moor's declaration specifically exempted ""credentialed members of the media"" from the curfew requirements. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal (Photo: Andrew Ford) Column: APP reporter's arrest is latest in 'spasm of suppression' Law enforcement officers on the scene did not begin enforcing the curfew until 10 p.m. Martinez Contreras was arrested less than 20 minutes later. U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, whose 6th congressional district includes Asbury Park, tweeted Tuesday afternoon: ""Protest in Asbury Park last night like others in New Jersey was peaceful and even joined by the local police. We must allow journalists to cover the protest events. America’s principles including the First Amendment should be protected."" New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said, of the four major rallies in New Jersey, Asbury Park's demonstration was the only one that turned ""less than peaceful."" The 12 people arrested were charged with offenses ranging from third-degree aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, obstruction and some disorderly persons offenses. Three officers were injured, Callahan said. One was struck in the head with a rock and suffered a depressive skull fracture, another was bitten in the leg and a third required stitches on his chin, Callahan said. Protesters have been asked to leave twice since 9:30 p.m. but some remain here. Some say they’re going nowhere. https://t.co/sGfSssI4AQ — Gustavo Martinez (@newsguz) June 2, 2020 Martinez Contreras was issued a complaint for ""failure to disperse upon official order,"" a disorderly persons charge that technically falls under the category of a riot offense. A disorderly persons offense comes with a potential six-month jail sentence and $1,000 fine. The complaint filed against Martinez Contreras lists Asbury Park Police Capt. Amir Bercovicz as the involved officer. “The use of broad curfews is a disturbing development, for a wide range of reasons: specifically targeting First Amendment activities — including the arrests of members of the press, placing limits on free movement, and creating an opening for the exact type of racially disparate enforcement in policing that has brought us to this moment,"" said Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Garden State Equality, the state's largest LGBT advocacy organization, also attended Monday's rally. He, too, spoke out against the arrest of Martínez Contreras. “Arresting journalists and violence against citizens are hallmarks of totalitarian regimes,” he added. “We are watching our country decline into fascism and we desperately need leadership.” Alex Biese contributed to this report.

Asbury Park Press Gustavo Martinez Contreras, a reporter at the Asbury Park Press who covers communities at the Jersey Shore for our USA TODAY NETWORK, was arrested and detained while covering a protest Monday night. Martinez Contreras was filming police arresting demonstrators who were, according to authorities, violating an 8 p.m. curfew in Asbury Park; his video was streamed live on Twitter. He was transported to the Belmar Police Department's headquarters, issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse and released early Tuesday.

We believe — firmly: Journalists should not be roughed up. Journalists should not be detained. Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) Journalists should not be arrested. Journalists should not be charged. Journalists should be allowed to cover demonstrations. Journalists are allowed to cover demonstrations. Demonstrators are allowed to protest. We do not condone violence. We do not condone looting. We also do not condone aggressive police tactics that cross the line and become brutality. We do not condone hate. We mourn George Floyd. And all the dozens of other African-Americans who have died at the hands of police. We do salute police — like those officers in Camden, in Jersey City and in Newark, as well as dozens of other communities in New Jersey and metropolitan New York — who have worked with demonstrators to maintain peace. We salute officers who've joined in protests. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What would police reform in America look like? Many don't even know what it means JERRY CARINO: Arrest of APP reporter covering Asbury Park protest part of a troubling trend CHARLIE STILE: Trump blasts governors as 'weak' in face of George Floyd protests. Murphy has other ideas We also salute our colleagues, across our own USA TODAY NETWORK and those who work for other outlets, who are bravely covering these demonstrations amid a pandemic. As Jerry Carino, a columnist at the Asbury Park Press, wrote, Martinez Contreras was not alone on Monday: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian television reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. A CNN correspondent covering rioting in Minneapolis was arrested during a live broadcast. All of these are deeply regrettable. This is a moment to reflect on the power of the First Amendment, which is always our north star: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. We will remain vigilant. We will not be intimidated. We will report the news, as the First Amendment guarantees.

Asbury Park Press Like the many journalists harassed during George Floyd protests, Gustavo Martínez Contreras was doing his job. New Jersey's leaders must draw a line. At 9:40 p.m. Monday, Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martínez Contreras filmed an extraordinary moment as police and protestors took a knee together during a rally for George Floyd in Asbury Park. Thirty minutes later, Martinez Contreras was being loaded into a police van, detained for doing his job (see the above video). This is happening all over the country and it’s bad for democracy. Real bad. According to the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, U.S. police arrested or attacked journalists more than 100 times from May 28-31, as protests over the killing of George Floyd spread throughout the country. Some perspective on that: Over the last three years, U.S. Press Freedom Tracker documented between 100-150 such incidents per year. Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) So police did a year’s worth of harassing of journalists in four days. Then there were Monday’s incidents: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian T.V. reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. Capping off this spasm of suppression was the arrest of Martinez Contreras. Prior to the rally, Asbury Park officials had expressly exempted media members from the 8 p.m. curfew. Martinez Contreras was filming the post-curfew arrest of protesters and did not appear to be obstructing police at all when an officer approached him and yelled, ""you're under arrest"" and ""get your f---ing hands behind your back."" He was released several hours later with a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse. Later Tuesday morning, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal addressed the matter. ""I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today,"" Grewal wrote on Twitter. ""We will also figure out why this happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. Because in America, we don't lock up reporters for doing their job."" Altogether, the scope of law enforcement’s harassment of the media over the past week might be unprecedented in the history of American journalism. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. That’s a real slippery slope. Locking up and beating down the press is the go-to move of the world’s most repressive regimes. There’s a reason why President Trump repeatedly slams the media as “the enemy.” It’s a pesky check on government power. His attempts at demonization appear to be working. Now is the time for responsible leaders in New Jersey to ask questions and demand answers about why a reporter was hauled away for doing his job. Draw a line before this becomes a trend here like it has elsewhere.

Kenney, Outlaw decry vigilantism in Fishtown “I think there’s a shift coming, and I’m happy to be a part of it. Nothing makes me happier to see so many different people of different races out here marching together. I think when Martin Luther King said, ‘I have a dream,’ this is what he meant,” a Black protester told NBC-10 reporter Tim Furlong. Mayor Jim Kenney condemned the vigilantism in the city’s Fishtown neighborhood that resulted in several injuries Monday night. At a press briefing Tuesday, the mayor said such actions would not be tolerated going forward. Monday night, a group of men wielding baseball bats gathered around the city’s 26th Police Precinct as a protest group approached the neighborhood. According to video of the scene, they said they were there to protect police. The men physically clashed with protesters, resulting in at least one hospitalization. “Their actions were antagonistic and made a bad situation worse. We do not condone vigilantism,” said Kenney during his Tuesday afternoon press conference. “ I’m glad police moved to disperse. I’m not happy about how long it took.” “I am also disturbed by reports that some officers were seen high-fiving and taking photos. That is unacceptable,” Kenney said. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw reiterated Kenney’s sentiments, saying protecting police is not necessary. “I didn’t ask them to do that. I don’t welcome that. I don’t invite them back. We don’t need them,” she said. “To be clear, we do not condone any acts of violence. We don’t take sides. Our mission is to always protect all persons.” Outlaw also addressed Monday’s confrontation on I-676 yesterday, when a splinter group of a couple hundred protesters broke away from a planned marching route and spilled into the Vine Street Expressway. Police used tear gas to disperse and arrest the group. Outlaw said protesters were throwing objects at the police and putting themselves and others in harm’s way by being on the freeway. “The [tear gas] option was selected … when it became evident that no other options would be effective. We will uphold right to assemble and protest. Will can not tolerate acts of violence,” she said. When asked about the alleged use of pepper spray by a police officer against a protester, Outlaw suggested some internal discipline may be imposed after an investigation. “This incident and others will be fully investigated by internal affairs,” she said. “I will not allow the actions of some individuals to undermine efforts we are trying to make as an organization moving forward at this time.” At the same briefing, U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D- Pa.) made comments critical of President Donald Trump’s statements Monday. “What the president of the United States said and did last night is wrong, and only inflames the situation,” said Boyle. “Perhaps this is like Charlie Brown and the football: I ask President Trump to please refrain from pouring more gas on the fire. It affects people’s lives here in our community.” Boyle also is asking Congress to reconvene soon, saying, “If there is an absence of leadership in the White House, it’s time for Congress to step up.” “In times like this, we all matter and what we say matters,” he said. “We are ripping ourselves apart and the whole world is watching. It’s time for the American people to come together.”",0.0

Asbury Park Press Gustavo Martinez Contreras, a reporter at the Asbury Park Press who covers communities at the Jersey Shore for our USA TODAY NETWORK, was arrested and detained while covering a protest Monday night. Martinez Contreras was filming police arresting demonstrators who were, according to authorities, violating an 8 p.m. curfew in Asbury Park; his video was streamed live on Twitter. He was transported to the Belmar Police Department's headquarters, issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse and released early Tuesday. Tuesday morning, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced that Martinez Contreras' charges had been dropped and that his office would conduct an inquiry. The editorial continues below the tweet. Last night, an @AsburyParkPress reporter was arrested while covering protests.  I know that officers face enormous challenges while maintaining order during a chaotic situation. But I've discussed this matter with local authorities and they will be dismissing the charge today. — AG Gurbir Grewal (@NewJerseyOAG) June 2, 2020 Regardless of the curfew, Martinez Contreras should not have been charged. We believe — firmly: Journalists should not be roughed up. Journalists should not be detained. Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) Journalists should not be arrested. Journalists should not be charged. Journalists should be allowed to cover demonstrations. Journalists are allowed to cover demonstrations. Demonstrators are allowed to protest. We do not condone violence. We do not condone looting. We also do not condone aggressive police tactics that cross the line and become brutality. We do not condone hate. We mourn George Floyd. And all the dozens of other African-Americans who have died at the hands of police. We do salute police — like those officers in Camden, in Jersey City and in Newark, as well as dozens of other communities in New Jersey and metropolitan New York — who have worked with demonstrators to maintain peace. We salute officers who've joined in protests. FOR SUBSCRIBERS: What would police reform in America look like? Many don't even know what it means JERRY CARINO: Arrest of APP reporter covering Asbury Park protest part of a troubling trend CHARLIE STILE: Trump blasts governors as 'weak' in face of George Floyd protests. Murphy has other ideas We also salute our colleagues, across our own USA TODAY NETWORK and those who work for other outlets, who are bravely covering these demonstrations amid a pandemic. As Jerry Carino, a columnist at the Asbury Park Press, wrote, Martinez Contreras was not alone on Monday: A reporter and photographer for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, and a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer were detained by police for two hours while covering protests in Philadelphia. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was handcuffed and detained while covering a protest in Cincinnati. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter was arrested while covering a protest in Atlanta. Student-newspaper reporters from Ohio State University were pepper sprayed by cops in Columbus after repeatedly identifying themselves as news media. An Australian television reporter and her cameraman were accosted by police in Washington, D.C. A CNN correspondent covering rioting in Minneapolis was arrested during a live broadcast. All of these are deeply regrettable. This is a moment to reflect on the power of the First Amendment, which is always our north star: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

The bishop who oversees St. John’s is among the critics. “He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,” Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR’s Morning Edition. “He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation.” “He did not pray,” the bishop continued. “He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate … represent.” Every president since James Madison has visited St. John’s Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday’s visit. “There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,” Budde told NPR’s Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. “I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,” the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John’s nearly 30 minutes before Washington’s just-installed 7 p.m. curfew was to begin – timing that added to the chaos and confusion among demonstrators and that incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. “Shameful!” Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after “federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,” the city’s police force’s job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful! DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC at 7 pm (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia’s breakfast-time Sunrise show. “While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,” Australia’s 7NEWS reports. “Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted…for doing their job” – Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia’s ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. “Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,” she says. “We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to … and then we ended up getting tear-gassed.” The situation, she said, was “absolutely terrifying.” “I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we’ll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we’re feeling perfectly safe,” Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, “Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously.” Trump’s use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation’s capitol. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” “All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,” Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. “I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,” she said. “I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest.”",0.0

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he’d used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it’s set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that’s sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That’s hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. “It tells us that there’s racism baked in to the housing market,” said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans’ higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. “There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,” Perry said. “COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics.” Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd’s last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. “That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,” Perry said. “It represents the employers who don’t provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities.” He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. “If we don’t address the structural inequality,” Perry said, “we’ll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits.”",0.0

The turmoil comes amidst an ongoing pandemic and record-high levels of unemployment, a backdrop that has created even more chaos and uncertainty for tens of millions of Americans. And yet somehow, the stock market continues to chug right along, continuing a trend since a March crash. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, along with S&P 500 and Nasdaq, have been climbing steadily since protestors took the streets early last week. Even on Monday after President Trump threatened to deploy military and “quickly solve the problem” if states fail to contain violent protests, the Dow only fell briefly before rebounding in overnight futures trade. While the stock rally may seem detached from the economic reality, the driving forces behind current market optimism make sense, at least to Wall Street investors. As of this week, all U.S. states are in various stages of reopening from a months-long coronavirus lockdown; index-leading stocks, including Amazon, Apple and Tesla, are flying high on either strong earnings or positive outlooks; international trade cast a ray of hope this week as the U.S. and China called a truce over simmering tensions; and the quest for a COVID-19 vaccine is producing encouraging news every week. There is also the matter of the CARES Act, which promised that the Federal Reserve would buy up trillions of dollars in bad corporate debt, freeing up lending and providing relief for concerned companies that have relied more on debt than ever before. “There are many valid reasons to be bearish on risk assets like stocks or corporate debt just now, but history shows markets look through many sorts of tumultuous events and have done so for decades,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis provider DataTrek Research, told CNBC. “That may seem counterintuitive, and perhaps not even ‘fair,’ but it’s absolutely true,” Colas added. Also Read: As Unemployment Soars Toward Great Depression High, Jeff Bezos Gets Even Richer Looking slightly beyond the recent weeks of reopening hopes, the U.S. stock market is almost halfway back to its pre-coronavirus peak. But it’s those sitting on the very top who took most of the winnings. The world’s richest man Jeff Bezos, for example, has seen his wealth grow $35 billion since the coronavirus outbreak, thanks to Amazon’s booming stock price. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman managed to profit over 10,000 percent on a million-dollar bet early in the pandemic. And no one in the world’s top wealth ranks is really financially hurt by the coronavirus in any way, a recent Forbes report found. That said, no one seems to know how much longer the stock rally will last. And the sentiment among the world’s most sophisticated investors doesn’t look great. According to CNBC’s latest quarterly Global CFO Council Survey, half of the polled CFOs expect the Dow to fall back to its coronavirus crash level below 19,000 before gaining ground again. Only 22 percent of CFOs believe the Dow will reach a new record high without seeing another major decline first. In the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region, where overall CFO outlook is the bleakest, 70 percent of surveyed executives expect another big crash in U.S. stocks in the near future, the survey found.",0.0

On May 25, George Floyd, an African American man, was killed in Minneapolis when a police officer kneeled on his neck and back during an arrest after a deli employee called 911, accusing Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill. State prosecutors charged former Police Officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for the death of Floyd. According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Acknowledge this Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend. Another video of Saturday’s protest depicts an NYPD officer pulling down the face mask of a protester before shooting the person with pepper spray. Resident Anthony Rivera organized a peaceful protest in front of City Hall joined by friends and strangers on Sunday, May 31 chanting “no justice, no peace, no racist police,” “Hands up don’t shoot,” and Floyd’s haunting last words, “I can’t breath.” “We are tired of dying,” said Rivera. “We are tired of protesting the same damn thing and we are tired of being tired. We need people to step the f**k up and do something and be a change. Have the uncomfortable conversation. We are uncomfortable every day.” Rivera and the protesters urged the community to come together and for their non black neighbors to be an ally. “Use your voice, use your power, use your platform, and call for systemic change,” said Rivera. “Black lives matter.” He and protesters urged residents to contact their senators and local officials, donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, acknowledge systemic racism, and diversify their friend circles. “Everyone knows there is racism, but what have you done to stop it?” asked Rivera to a crowd of onlookers and passersby. He said he was dismayed by the city’s lack of response, noting that neither Mayor Steven Fulop nor the city’s official Twitter page had released any statements condemning the officers, racism, or expressing sympathy for Floyd, who is just the latest death in a string of African American deaths at the hands of police or white people. “Show some solidarity,” said Rivera. “People are dying.

He was a father, he was a brother, he was a son and most importantly he should be alive today. I know growing up white in America it is impossible for me to fully appreciate the hardships and struggles that a person has knowing that they are often treated differently solely because of the color of skin; however not being able to experience that firsthand doesn’t change my disgust for what we see time and again with regards to police brutality and racial bias towards the African American community.” He said he has been thinking a lot about what can be done in Jersey City to strengthen the community and make sure “our city serves as a model for acting fairly and protecting ALL its residents.” “While in Jersey City, we have taken some massive steps forward over the years, I know even here we have more work to do,” said Mayor Fulop. “My commitment to you is that we will continue to work hand in hand with leaders in the African American community to get our city to the place that it should be with every community knowing they are always treated equally.” On Monday, June 1, Black Men United also hosted a protest march from Berry Lane Park to the South District Precinct.

On May 25, George Floyd, an African American man, was killed in Minneapolis when a police officer kneeled on his neck and back during an arrest after a deli employee called 911, accusing Floyd of using a counterfeit $20 bill. State prosecutors charged former Police Officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for the death of Floyd. According to the complaint, Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd lost consciousness. The other officers involved have been fired. No charges have been filed against them as of June 1. Acknowledge this Floyd’s death has spurred protests in major cities across the country. Many have been peaceful. But violence, fires, and looting have erupted in several cities. In New York City video captured NYPD officers in two police SUVs driving into a group of protesters in Brooklyn over the weekend. Another video of Saturday’s protest depicts an NYPD officer pulling down the face mask of a protester before shooting the person with pepper spray. Resident Anthony Rivera organized a peaceful protest in front of City Hall joined by friends and strangers on Sunday, May 31 chanting “no justice, no peace, no racist police,” “Hands up don’t shoot,” and Floyd’s haunting last words, “I can’t breath.” “We are tired of dying,” said Rivera. “We are tired of protesting the same damn thing and we are tired of being tired. We need people to step the f**k up and do something and be a change. Have the uncomfortable conversation. We are uncomfortable every day.” Rivera and the protesters urged the community to come together and for their non black neighbors to be an ally. “Use your voice, use your power, use your platform, and call for systemic change,” said Rivera. “Black lives matter.” He and protesters urged residents to contact their senators and local officials, donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, acknowledge systemic racism, and diversify their friend circles. “Everyone knows there is racism, but what have you done to stop it?” asked Rivera to a crowd of onlookers and passersby. He said he was dismayed by the city’s lack of response, noting that neither Mayor Steven Fulop nor the city’s official Twitter page had released any statements condemning the officers, racism, or expressing sympathy for Floyd, who is just the latest death in a string of African American deaths at the hands of police or white people. “Show some solidarity,” said Rivera. “People are dying.

Asbury Park Press Take a pause. Two music industry executives have called for an industry-wide pause, called “The Show Must Be Paused,” hashtag #theshowmustbepaused, to reflect on the events of the past week related to the death of George Floyd and the issue of institutional racism in the United States. The movement, also called “Blackout Tuesday,” is “an initiative created by two black women in music in observance of the long-standing racism and inequity that exists from the boardroom to the boulevard,” according to the group’s mission statement. “We will not continue to conduct business as usual without regard to black lives.” George Floyd: Hundreds in Long Branch protest killing of black man by police The microphone at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. (Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean) Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records founded the movement, and the Warner Music Group, Sony/ATV, the Rolling Stones, Quincy Jones, Billie Eilish, Ebro Darden of New York City’s Hot 97 and World Cafe Live in Philly have expressed support. In Jersey, photographer Danny Clinch, R&B singer Jay Sean of Demarest, Emily Grove of Asbury Park, industry man Toby Record of New Brunswick, Andy Bernstein of the Voodudes, Brian Erick of the Extensions, Williams Honor of Asbury Park, and Old Bridge music maker Diego Nicollo are among those who are on board. “As a person of color I feel it's my duty to stand with the protesters,” Nicollo said. “To do different would be betrayal.” Phish, fronted by Princetonian Trey Anastasio, canceled their weekly “Dinner and a Movie” webcast in observance. “Phish stands in solidarity with all those working to eliminate systemic racism,” stated the band on social media. “We are deeply troubled by the senseless killing of George Floyd and the injustice shown to countless others over the years. Building a better society requires every single one of us to play an active role.” Come together: P-Funk legend George Clinton shows what unity looks like as nation teeters Yet, some Jersey musician are balking at the movement for reasons ranging from a distrust of record labels due to their exploitative history of black musicians to a desire not to engage in a “white guilt day.” The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. “We and our artists will continue daily to support community driven BLM (Black Lives Matter) efforts to the best of our ability,” said an Instagram post from Don Giovanni Records of New Brunswick. “If BLM calls for the music industry to take action, we will. But I have no interest in supporting major label record executive white guilt day.” Justice for George Floyd: Halsey dodges rubber bullets, tear gas at Los Angeles protest Joe Steinhardt is the head of Don Giovanni Records.

There's also a suggestion to “take a break.” “Silence is the last thing we need,” said guitarist Joe Stuby of Clinton. “Was John Lennon silent? Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, were they silent?

We are uncomfortable every day.” Rivera and the protesters urged the community to come together and for their non black neighbors to be an ally. “Use your voice, use your power, use your platform, and call for systemic change,” said Rivera. “Black lives matter.” He and protesters urged residents to contact their senators and local officials, donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, acknowledge systemic racism, and diversify their friend circles. “Everyone knows there is racism, but what have you done to stop it?” asked Rivera to a crowd of onlookers and passersby. He said he was dismayed by the city’s lack of response, noting that neither Mayor Steven Fulop nor the city’s official Twitter page had released any statements condemning the officers, racism, or expressing sympathy for Floyd, who is just the latest death in a string of African American deaths at the hands of police or white people. “Show some solidarity,” said Rivera. “People are dying. Aknowledge this. Just something that shows I hear you and I see you.” Mayor disgusted with police brutality and racial bias Mayor Steven Fulop did release a statement on his Facebook page at 3:16 a.m. on May 30, stating that he typically doesn’t post regarding issues that didn’t happen in Jersey City but noted that Floyd’s murder is different. “It speaks to the centuries old racism and biases that have existed in our country and sadly still exist today,” said Mayor Fulop. “I want to extend my condolences to George Floyd’s family. He was a father, he was a brother, he was a son and most importantly he should be alive today. I know growing up white in America it is impossible for me to fully appreciate the hardships and struggles that a person has knowing that they are often treated differently solely because of the color of skin; however not being able to experience that firsthand doesn’t change my disgust for what we see time and again with regards to police brutality and racial bias towards the African American community.” He said he has been thinking a lot about what can be done in Jersey City to strengthen the community and make sure “our city serves as a model for acting fairly and protecting ALL its residents.” “While in Jersey City, we have taken some massive steps forward over the years, I know even here we have more work to do,” said Mayor Fulop. “My commitment to you is that we will continue to work hand in hand with leaders in the African American community to get our city to the place that it should be with every community knowing they are always treated equally.” On Monday, June 1, Black Men United also hosted a protest march from Berry Lane Park to the South District Precinct. Another protest and rally is planned for Saturday June 6 in front of City Hall at 280 Grove St. from 4 to 9 p.m. according to a social media post by “Jersey City Protest 6/6.” For updates on this and other stories check www.hudsonreporter.com and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter.

(Photo by John T. Ward. Click to enlarge.) The rear entrance and windows of the Tiffany store were boarded over, while neighbor Cos Bar was not. (Photo by John T. Ward. Click to enlarge.) An explanation for the action was not immediately available. Police Chief Darren McConnell told redbankgreen said he not confirmed a report that the move was a corporate decision to protect many if not all stores in the Tiffany chain. McConnell said there have been no incidents at the store, on Broad Street at the corner of Canal Street. The luxury goods retailer has been closed since the general lockdown of non-essential business to slow the spread of COVID-19 began in March. A notice posted on the heavy stainless-steel front door says the store is open for curbside pickup of orders. Neither of the two stores that flank Tiffany in the building, the Lash Lounge and Cos Bar, were boarded up. redbankgreen saw no other stores boarded up on a quick swing through the business district early Tuesday. Unlike cities across America, including Asbury Park, Red Bank has had no large protests or unrest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But Tiffany has been impacted elsewhere. According to the Washington Post, a company store in the District of Columbia was among a number of businesses whose windows were smashed in unrest over the weekend. Tiffany and other retailers also boarded up stores in Jacksonville, Florida, where a weekend of protests left behind damage, Jacksonville, Florida, according to another report. A message posted on the company Facebook page Monday night said: At Tiffany, our values include tolerance, respect and an unwavering dedication to diversity and inclusion. We stand in solidarity with our employees, customers and creative collaborators to take action. The responsibility is on all of us and we pledge to continue sharing our ongoing efforts. In New York City, Tiffany was among a number of high-end stores that were boarded up a month ago to prevent break-ins during their closure in the COVID-19 pandemic, according to amNY.

Right now, I’ve exhausted every lead. We never wanted to defy an order in any way,” he said. Trilivas and his gym members know there could be consequences. Bellmawr gym owner Ian Smith was arrested for reopening his gym a couple of weeks ago. “This is a part of health. We got to get our blood moving; we got to get pumping. We don’t want to get sick from diseases that aren’t even corona,” said James Yoemans, a gym member. “Eventually you will lose the compliance when you’re burning the candle at both ends. We’re not getting any financial help. My greatest fear right now would be what would happen if we don’t hear another date for a month or two, and we get into September and now they’re talking about possibly some kind of second wave coming and we never are allowed to open up again until next year,” Trilivas said. He says since closing his gyms in March he’s lost more than $100,000. And that doesn’t include the additional expenses he’s paid to keep the facility clean and safe during the pandemic. “I put the UV sterilizers inside the air conditioning ducts. We’re checking them for temperatures, and also giving them their own spray bottle where other stores wouldn’t have that. I mean, just that alone is way above and beyond anything you’re going to receive from any of the stores that have been open the entire time,” he said. Jon Bevacqua is the owner of CrossFit Gym in Hoboken. Bevacqua is also a part of a task force to reopen gyms. He says the biggest misunderstanding is that there’s a one size fits all with gyms. “Things like weather are things that we’re going to have to be working around. We’ll have to submit blueprints and plans and it only situates 15 people. We are technically still labeled as non-essential, so if we were to go outside and perform a fitness in the park or train people outside, we technically aren’t covered through our insurance company. So we would be putting CrossFit Hoboken more at jeopardy and at risk to losing our business license,” Bevacqua said. Trilivas and Bevacqua say at this point a reopening date is critical to their livelihood. Trivilas says opening Monday is a form of protest, but he’ll cooperate with police and shut down if they enforce the executive order. And if that happens, he may have no choice but to close his businesses for good.",0.0

Murphys Orders on Indoor Gatherings - NJ Spotlight",https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/06/two-south-jersey-churches-reopen-defying-gov-murphys-orders-on-indoor-gatherings/,en,False,,310813,newjersey.statenews.net,http://newjersey.statenews.net/,"Credit: Jon Hurdle At least two South Jersey churches held services in their buildings on Sunday for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down most institutions, defying Gov. Phil Murphy’s continuing ban on all indoor gatherings of 10 or more people. The services followed a lawsuit by the churches, and two others in South Jersey, that asks a federal judge in Camden to block Murphy’s executive orders shutting down most religious gatherings, claiming that the orders violate two clauses of the U.S. Constitution. More pressure on the ban on religious gatherings came on Friday with another lawsuit by 27 New Jersey churches, asking a federal court in Trenton to declare that religious services are “essential” services like supermarkets or hardware stores, contrasting with Murphy’s determination that religious services are not essential. Alyana Alfaro, a spokeswoman for Murphy, declined to comment on the litigation or on whether churches violating the orders would face enforcement action by police. She cited two executive orders limiting indoor gatherings including religious services to not more than 10 people, and 25 for outdoor gatherings. But she highlighted Murphy’s statement at Friday’s coronavirus press briefing indicating that restrictions on religious gatherings will be eased in coming weeks. “I anticipate being able to raise the limits on indoor gatherings in a way that will allow for greater indoor religious services for the weekend of June 12,” Murphy said in a transcript carried on Twitter. “We will continue working with our faith institutions to ensure our houses of worship are strong and safe.” Temperature checks, masks, social distancing In Millville, the Dwelling Place Pentecostal church opened on Sunday for its first indoor service since the state-ordered COVID-related shutdown began in March. All congregants were required to take a temperature test in the church lobby, masks were mandatory, and seating was spaced to conform with social-distancing guidelines, said the pastor, Bobby Bledsoe. To guard against the risk of infection, the church has been sanitized with professional-grade alcohol to standards approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, and was run at a negative air pressure, meaning that the windows would be open at the same time the air conditioning is on to keep fresh air circulating, he said. The decision to reopen before the governor lifted the relevant orders was based on the reopening of some major retailers, beaches and boardwalks, raising questions about why religious institutions were still effectively locked down, Bledsoe said. “We didn’t mind closing to be a good neighbor and to follow what the governor said but when all these places have been opening, and you have 300-400 people in a Lowe’s or a grocery store, or you can go to the liquor store or get an abortion, and churches being nonessential, that’s when we decided we had to take a stand and let our voice be heard that we believe the church is essential,” he said. Credit: Jon Hurdle Associate pastor Franco Acevedo quoted the bible, urging believers not to be deterred from gathering even in the darkness, “and if you look around, it’s pretty dark,” he said, referring to the pandemic and Saturday’s riots in dozens of cities to protest the killing of George Floyd, an African American, by police in Minneapolis. “I would hope that as people see the hatred and the violence, they will say, ‘This is a time when I need to come and be healed spiritually and emotionally,” he said. “I would like to think we can provide a place for them to come, and to be loved, and to see a light in the darkness.” Not civil disobedience Acevedo acknowledged that Sunday’s reopening was pushing the limits of legality, but denied it was an act of civil disobedience. “We understand that we are pushing the boundaries a bit,” he said, in a parking lot interview. “This is not an act of civil disobedience intentionally. This is an act, I believe, of faith when we say that God is calling us to do, to maybe shake things up a little bit, maybe break some ice, maybe be trail blazers or pioneers to the next level of this new normal.” Another church in Clementon reportedly reopened over the weekend of May 16-17. Stephanie Gonzalez, 29, a pharmacy technician from Vineland, said she had been attending parking-lot services at the Dwelling Place church during the pandemic but, sitting in her car before Sunday’s service, was looking forward to the first indoor gathering since the building was closed by the executive orders. Credit: Jon Hurdle “It’s a blessing because we’re standing up for what we believe in, and everything else is open so why can’t we be?” she said. Brittany Carastro, 27, who has been a regular congregant for more than a year, acknowledged that she was a little nervous about coming back into contact with others but felt confident that the church had taken all appropriate measures to keep people safe, and so she had decided to return. “They are going against what the governor has said but at the same time, I’m going to come in and support my church,” she said before the service. No sign of police By 10:30 a.m. Sunday, the scheduled time for the service to start, there were no police on the premises, indicating that the orders were not being enforced there. The police also stayed away from Millville’s New Life Church which also reopened for an indoor service for the first time on Sunday. Pastor Richard Myers said before the event that he had decided to reopen for inside services despite the executive orders mostly because his community is suffering from the effects of more than two months of lockdown. Credit: Jon Hurdle Prolonged isolation is producing more divorce, depression, domestic violence and even post-traumatic stress disorder, Myers said, and that’s why people need to come back to church. “That’s the reason why it’s time to open for us,” he said. “It’s the oath of my ordination to take care of the people that have been assigned to me.” To guard against any resurgent infection, the musicians in New Life Church, which attracted around 300 people to services before the pandemic, would be about 30 feet away from the nearest congregant, while Myers himself was planning to be at least 10 feet away from attendees, he said. Details of the lawsuits Meanwhile, the two churches are joining with Cornerstone Community Church, also in Millville, and House of Praise in Swedesboro in seeking a court order to declare that the executive orders on church operation are unconstitutional. Their suit, filed in federal court in Camden on May 22, accuses Murphy, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan of violating the rights of religion, speech, assembly, due process and equal protection under the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution by maintaining the restrictions on religious services. It says the 10-person limit for indoor gathering effectively bans all but the “tiniest” religious services, and it accused the defendants of imposing tighter restrictions on religious communities than on some other institutions. “Defendants’ granting of numerous special exemptions to their bans on public gatherings, and inclusion of purportedly ‘essential’ businesses and activities provided that social distancing practices are observed, demonstrates that defendants will consider less-restrictive means to further their purported government interest than those employed with respect to religion,” the suit says. U.S. District Judge Robert Kugler set an online hearing on June 4 for the defendants to argue why a preliminary injunction against the restrictions on religious gatherings should not be granted. The Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the suit. In a separate suit filed in federal court in Trenton on May 29, 27 churches asked a judge to rule that religious institutions are just as essential as the businesses like grocery stores and pharmacies that have been allowed to remain open during the pandemic because of that designation. “He has chosen to keep open the liquor stores and abortion clinics, calling them essential as he has governed this crisis, yet has chosen to keep houses of worship closed,” said plaintiff pastor Walter Nistorenko of the Abundant Life Church in Ocean View, referring to Murphy. “We know that churches are beyond essential.”",0.0

Newark says 3,500 turned out for Saturday’s rally and peaceful march disabled 3043213408 UvyUBmf7iIs true New Jersey’s state capital is on lockdown with a 7 p.m. curfew. Sunday night, Trenton officers saw their vehicles go up in flames. Hours earlier, the same officers went to their knees in solidarity with protesters a week after a Minneapolis officer’s knee seemed to squeeze the life out of a handcuffed George Floyd. “I can’t breathe” become a rallying cry across America – along with dozens of arrests. In Atlantic City, a peaceful protest became physical — leading to clashes with riot-gear-wearing officers and looting of stores. The mayor has imposed a week-long, nightly curfew and police urged the public to avoid the city. Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, looked like anything but that with looting, language unfit for TV, and a long night of unrest that left more than a dozen officers injured. Across the Delaware in Camden, county police marched with protesters against racism. In Newark over the weekend, a young crowd yanked a flag down in Military Park, stomped it and then burned it. There was no battle line of officers in riot gear and very little social distancing. Instead, police officers escorted the People’s Organization for Progress’ march through downtown. “We’re going to take our anger and our indignation and turn it in to energy to put together a force for the abolition of police brutality,” said People’s Organization for Progress Chair Larry Hamm. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka walked behind a “Justice for George Floyd” banner. “It’s time for the good officers to be good officers. Those officers who were with him should have locked him up on the spot, picked him up and marched his ass to the precinct,” Baraka said. Baraka and Hamm urged anyone itching for trouble to leave. This city knows trouble all too well. In the summer of 1967 two white officers beat black cab driver John Smith. It touched off five days of rioting that killed 26 people, including a police officer and a firefighter and bloodied the mayor’s father, Amiri Baraka. The struggle five-plus decades ago included oversight of police conduct. Just last month in a virtual hearing, the state supreme court took up the police union’s challenge of Newark’s Civilian Complaint Review Board and whether it should have the power to subpoena officers. “Send them that video and hopefully they have a conscience to vote for a Civilian Complaint Review Board because the police can’t police themselves,” Baraka said. The march included a sea of diversity but with one universal message: a quest for justice. “We got to hold police accountable. We got to hold people accountable for the killings and the non-valuing of lives,” said one protester named Brian. Before the rally, 38-year-old Mustafa Shabazz and his 3-year-old son Mushsin heard the mayor at city hall condemn what happened to George Floyd. “When you constantly see stuff like that you wonder what the future is going to be for your son. You start to build a hatred for police when you constantly see them killing us,” the Newark resident said. What will he tell his son about the police? “I’ll tell him that there’s some good and there’s some bad. Just be cautious. Whenever you’re in contact with the cops, just be cautious because you never know,” Shabazz said. Caution went to the wind in New York’s SOHO neighborhood overnight as looters gutted luxury stores along Broadway after a day of peaceful protests. Police blamed outside agitators. It’s a familiar theme seen across the country, but not in Miami. When police saw protesters coming, they got on their knees. The crowd cried and did the same and the two groups embraced. But, from the White House, criticism calling governors “weak” for not quelling the violence as the National Guard prepares to meet protesters in the streets.",0.0

Sunday, June 30, 2019 NorthJersey There's no stopping the spirit of Pride. The global coronavirus pandemic has changed every aspect of life, and the resulting cessation of public gatherings means June's commemoration of Pride Month will be decidedly different. Organizations across the region are getting creative, hosting celebrations, gatherings and shows as the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community perseveres during a trying time, facing an uncertain future. This summer's now-canceled NYC Pride schedule of in-person events was originally planned for June 14 to 28 by organization Heritage of Pride. The Pride March moves north on 7th Ave. Sunday June 30, 2019 (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler/NorthJersey.com) “While this pandemic prevents us from coming together to march, it will in no way stop us from celebrating the indelible contributions that the LGBTIA+ community has made to New York City or from recommitting ourselves to the fight for equal rights,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an April statement. It's been half a century since the modern LGBTQ rights movement was born with the Gay Pride March presented by the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee in June 1970. That landmark march came a year after the historic uprising at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, when on June 28, 1969, a riot broke out as New York City police raided the bar, enforcing a law against selling alcohol to homosexual patrons. It should have been a banner year. Instead, like everything else during the pandemic, events have had to be rethought. Here are some of the inventive ways. 'Enormous virtual hug' The New Jersey LGBTQ Pride Parade, Rally and Festival, an Asbury Park fixture since 1992 historically held on the first Sunday in June was moved by event organizers Jersey Pride, Inc. from June 7 to National Coming Out Day, Sunday, Oct. 11. NJ HISTORY: How the LGBTQ community saved Asbury Park That delay isn't stopping Paradise, a hub of gay nightlife in Asbury Park, from planning to celebrate online. Paradise will present a Virtual Pride Zoom Party 5 to 9 p.m. Sunday, June 7. Created by DJs Steven Jay and Steve Sidewalk, the night will feature music from Jay and Sidewalk and fellow DJs Tyler Valentine and Mikey Mo, as well as drag performances. ""For some people (Paradise) is just like their safe haven, seeing everybody, making those kinds of connections with people and having that availability,"" said Jay, also assistant manager at the club. ""Maybe there’s somebody you’ve missed that you haven’t exchanged numbers with that will be there (at the Zoom party), maybe there’s someone that you’ve been worried about or you just want to see people, see their face, see that they’re OK. Sometimes hearing them isn’t enough.” Want access to all of our stories? Consider purchasing a digital subscription to the Asbury Park Press to keep up with the latest news in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. Paradise was opened at the Jersey Shore by record producer Shep Pettibone in 1999, the same year President Bill Clinton proclaimed June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month and a decade before President Barack Obama's recognition of June as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month in 2009. ""We were very, very connected and now we’re all feeling that loss and a lot of people are feeling that loss and they’re home alone in their apartments,"" said Paradise event coordinator Kelly J. Martin. So it is really important for us to be able to see each other and attend something together, even if it is only virtual. What they really, really need right now is a huge, enormous virtual hug.” Jersey Pride and Asbury Park-based organization Garden State Equality will present United in Pride noon Sunday, June 7 via Facebook Live and YouTube. Sponsored by Bank of America, the virtual celebration will feature entertainment from artists including La Bouche and Felipe Rose of the Village People, and United in Pride will also raise funds for organizations working for racial justice in New Jersey, according to the event's website. Fellow Asbury Park destination Georgies Bar will host a Virtual Pride Tea Dance 3 to 6 p.m. Sunday, June 7 via Zoom, Instagram and Facebook Live, hosted by drag star Pissi Myles and featuring DJ UnclesNephew. The Jersey City LGBT Pride Festival will sponsor a Drag Queen Story Hour via Instagram Live featuring Harmonica Sunbeam and hosted by bookshop WORD Jersey City 11 a.m. Saturday, June 6. Keep the momentum going A pair of New Jersey towns that held their inaugural Pride celebrations in 2019, Toms River and Princeton, are likewise finding ways to keep the momentum going. Exit 82 Theatre Company, which launched Toms River Pride last year, reconfigured its June 20 celebration with social distancing guidelines. Saturday morning will feature a ""Drive-Through Pride"" with a closed path so attendees can participate from their own cars, followed in the afternoon and evening by online events including make-up demonstrations, drag performances and presentations by Garden State Equality. ""This is something we wanted to do because in Toms River and Ocean County, the tradition stands stronger than the party,"" said Billy Cardone, executive director of Exit 82 Theatre Company. ""We cared more about the visibility of our community so people are reminded that they are not alone.""

(Photo: Courtesy of the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice) The first Princeton Pride Parade, presented by the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice, drew more than 3,000 people in June 2019, including Gov. Phil Murphy and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy, according to Rustin Center chief activist Robt Seda-Schreiber. With the possibility of an in-person gathering out of the question this June, the Rustin Center pivoted to Virtual Pride '20, an online parade happening 7 to 10 p.m. on Saturday, June 20. Virtual Pride '20 is expanding on online community gatherings nightly through Rustin Center's Social Justice Power Hours on its Facebook page. “We want to dedicate ourselves to always being true to our local community but also with our eyes on that national outreach where we can really bring together folks in this unique opportunity,"" Seda-Schreiber said.

Their North Jersey Pride Festival is usually held the second Sunday in June at Memorial Park in Maplewood with a PG-rated, family orientation. Last year’s festival drew upwards of 5,000. “We’re designed with families in mind,” said executive director C.J. Prince. Obviously, they’re facing a bit of a challenge, in this socially-distanced year. North Jersey Pride serves the entire northern part of the state. The events draw people from even beyond New Jersey. Somehow, on some platform, the show will go on, Prince promised. “We definitely didn’t want to let June go by without marking it,” Prince said. “People really need something to look forward to and celebrate. Our theme this year is, ‘Resilient and Proud.’"" CJ Prince, Executive Director of North Jersey Pride, stands near rainbow painted crosswalks in Maplewood on Tuesday, June 19, 2018. (Photo: Michael Karas/NorthJersey.com) A lot of ideas are still being batted around for June. Among them: a virtual raising of the rainbow flag, with appropriate speeches and commentary, on Sunday, June 7; a “make your own pride banner” event in which community kids and adults make signs to be displayed outside of homes which locals can then see from their cars or on foot.; Instagram live segments boosting local LGBTQ-owned businesses, and a big June 28 virtual event featuring celebrities, music, performances and videos of North Jerseyans celebrating Pride in their homes. Details, for these and other programs, will be worked out in the next few weeks: visit northjerseypride.org to stay in the loop.

Fighting bullying with Pride Beyond Pride Month, Southern New Jersey Gay Pride’s 12th annual festival in at Cooper River Park in Cherry Hill is planned for noon to 6 p.m. Sept. 13 but it’s unclear if that date will change due to the current pandemic. The celebration’s theme is #YouAreIncluded in collaboration with WorldPride. This is the fifth year of an anti-bullying program. The free, rain-or-shine event includes vendors, live performances and dancing. Participants are asked to bring their own blankets, chairs and tables. Southern New Jersey Gay Pride director and founder DeAnn Cox said they’re also looking at options for a virtual Pride celebration and will see how other festivals unfold virtually in June. Philadelphia-based LGBTQ+ film festival qFLIX Philadelphia, originally scheduled to launch March 22, was also postponed and has switched gears to launch PrideFLIX, an online iteration of the festival launching Monday, June 1, with a portion of ticket proceeds supporting local LGBTQ+ charities. While the Philly Pride Parade and Festival originally scheduled for June 14 has been canceled, the day's planned Philly Pride Run 5K race has been reconfigured as a virtual run. Registered participants pick their own start time, location and course and will have from 10 a.m. Sunday, June 14 to 10 a.m. Sunday, June 21 to complete the race supporting the William Way LGBT Community Center. CLOSE See Gov. Phil Murphy and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker speak at Jersey Pride, Asbury Park's 27th annual celebration of the LGBTQ community. Asbury Park Press 'We’re a particularly resilient bunch' The LGBTQ Prom has been held by the Hudson Pride Center in New Jersey's Hudson County for more than 10 years. This year’s online edition will allow young folks, age 15 to 22, to significantly expand their dating pool. You can hook up with a hot guy in Melbourne or a sexy lady in Mumbai and bring them — virtually — to the prom. “We believe every kid should be able to have a prom and go with their date of their choice, in the attire of their choice,” said Elizabeth Schedl, chief operations officer for Hudson Pride Center. The event, which will feature a DJ, vogue competition, and the crowning of “royals” (king and queen is too cisgender) is from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. June 13. The Hudson County group, based in Jersey City, will be hosting many other Pride events, including a SAGE LGBTQ yoga event (for 55 and older) 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. June 3 on Zoom, a live happy hour from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. June 11 in which folks 21 and up can learn to make cocktails, Pride yoga events on June 16 and 22 (6 p.m. to 7 p.m.), an open mike night on June 18 (6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., ages 18 and up), a queer book reading on June 25 at 11 a.m., and a Pride watch party on June 28. “Our main focus is really to make sure to connect with individuals and celebrate our pride — especially the most isolated individuals,” Schedl said. “I think there’s a sense of loss, in that the community won’t be able to be together and celebrate,” said Rick Kavin, vice-president of operations for The Pride Center of New Jersey. “But at the same time I think we’re a particularly resilient bunch.” More than 65,000 people participated in Rochester, New York's Pride parade and festival last year. Organizers hope to reschedule the week-long series of events sometime this fall, depending on how the state's re-opening plans proceed.

(Photo: Carlos Ortiz/Rochester Democrat and Chronicle) The Connecticut Virtual Pride Facebook page serves as a guide to how Pride is being commemorated online by groups across the state in June. At 7 p.m. Monday, June 8, the page will premiere a virtual parade of sorts in the form of a video featuring contributions from local organizations and community members. In Delaware, there will be no annual Pride Festival and Parade this year. It would have been the second parade for Delaware Pride Inc., which has been run by a small group of volunteers since the late '90s. Because the organization is run by only a handful of people, it does not have the capability to host something virtually, explained Vice President Amanda White. Madeline Porter of Wilmington displays a rainbow flag during Delaware Pride Festival in Dover on June 1, 2019 (Photo: Jeanne Kuang/The News Journal) The group also is looking into virtual events for June and beyond. The festival and parade have been rescheduled for Saturday, June 5, 2021. The event is free to the public. Fay Jacobs, who is the editor of Letters from Camp Rehoboth, a non-profit community service organization and publication, said efforts to connect the community have gone virtual. The group will celebrate Pride Month with the June 15 issue of Letters, Jacobs said. “At this point, everyone is worried about a couple of things,” the local author said. “They’re worried about the upcoming election. They’re worried about the pandemic. A lot of people are home and paying attention more than ever to the news and, personally, I hope to see Pride celebrations on the network news, on the cable channels. I don’t know if we will. I’m certainly very hopeful we will.” On Tuesday, May 26, Delaware Governor John Carney lifted more social restrictions in the First State, announcing that gatherings of up to 250 people will be allowed starting June 1. Whether that will change plans for Pride Month celebrations is yet to be determined. White said because Delaware Pride does not have a membership count, it may be hard to hold in-person events even with the relaxing of restrictions because it would be difficult to figure out how many people might show up. 'Stay home, stay connected' Baltimore Pride, in its 45th year and one of the oldest pride events in the nation, has been postponed and has not yet announced a new date for its celebration. The festival is usually three days long and draws around 30,000 people. When it does occur, the celebration is slated to include a drag show, high heel race, pet parade and more. The Frederick Pride Parade in Frederick, Maryland, is rescheduled for Sunday, Oct.4. Now in its ninth year, the event is part of an all-day festival at Carroll Creek Linear Park. Elsewhere in Maryland, The Cumberland Pride Festival in Allegany County will be two weeks later on Sunday, Oct. 18. And the Westminster Pride Extravaganza in the Baltimore suburb of Westminster, is postponed with a new date not yet determined. According to howardcountypride.org, Howard County Pride organizers are postponing HoCO Pride 2020 “to continue taking protective measures against the spread of the virus.” Meanwhile, the group plans to celebrate pride in other ways in Howard County mainly through interactive online activities. Annapolis Pride is going virtual with its parade on Saturday, June 27 at 4 p.m. As Annapolispride.org says, “The parade and festival have been cancelled, but Pride is not!” The webpage offers a virtual festival with links to businesses, spiritual groups, community organizations and other resources.

Herenda and his staff listen to the Knights’ concerns and provide support and guidance as the student-athletes watch the national unrest generated by the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota. “We talk on the phone, we Zoom, and at night I make them check in with me,” Herenda said Tuesday, “because it’s a very dangerous time that we’re living in.” FDU, which last year celebrated its first NCAA tournament victory, has Knights living across the country, including New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., places where protests often have been overshadowed by looting. “When we Zoom, they talk, and my assistants talk, real talk, and what I hear from them is very positive,” said Herenda, who has led FDU for seven seasons. “But they’re scared, and they’re concerned. But it’s ‘Coach, we’re gonna be OK.’ And as a 59-year-old man, that’s reassuring to hear that from 20-year-old people.” Head coach Greg Herenda, center, of the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights celebrates with his team after defeating the Prairie View A&M Panthers 82-76 in the First Four of the 2019 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at UD Arena on March 19, 2019 in Dayton, Ohio.

I’m confident, because my kids are not as down as the adults are, because they have a better scope. They live it. “Our whole conference is in major metropolises where there’s been racism going on for a while, so they see it way more than our coaches see it. They have a more positive attitude.” Buy Photo Commencement Speaker FDU Knights Men's Basketball Coach Greg Herenda during the Fairleigh Dickinson graduation ceremony at MetLife Stadium on Tuesday, May 21, 2019. (Photo: Michael Karas/NorthJersey.com) Herenda, a college coach since 1983, encourages his players to stay positive, and stay home and safe at night. “I tell them straight up, ‘Guys, the right to protest – we wouldn’t be America without protest – but as your head basketball coach, you cannot go out at night, because it’s not protests, it’s danger,”' he said.

""And I just think there are so many more good people than the bad that are being shown every night on television,"" Herenda added, ""but we have to overcome that and stay together and be focused."" Herenda does not believe that the unrest in the metropolitan area, most notably in New York City, will deter recruits from attending colleges in the tri-state region. “Every state has numerous metropolitan areas that are affected, so it’s not like it’s just in New York and New Jersey, or in Los Angeles,” said Herenda, whose Knights were 11-19 this season. “It’s in Dallas, it’s in Sacramento, it’s in Phoenix.” The Knights’ incoming recruits look forward to attending the school located in Hackensack and Teaneck, Herenda said, and the veterans look forward to returning. “These kids can’t wait to get on campus and start going to school,” Herenda said of the newcomers. “That’s the overriding feeling.

From the foundation of this American continent to the present day, race relations have been and continue to be a seminal issue. From colonization through slavery, reconstruction and the civil rights movement to this very moment, we as a nation have never adequately confronted the evils of prejudice. Over the last several months we have shamefully watched as young black men like Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd were murdered for no apparent reasons. These are just the latest in a string of murders dating back to lynchings in the south after the Civil War. Why have these murders occurred? The answer is simple. They have occurred as a result of hatred for a person just because of the color of their skin. MIKE KELLY: What would police reform in America look like?

A peaceful protest over the killing of George Floyd and other Black people at the hands of law enforcement began around 3 p.m. at city police headquarters. Organized by the Philadelphia chapter of the political group “Party for Socialism and Liberation,” it moved through Chinatown to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Around 5 p.m., some of the estimated 3,000 to 5,000 protesters poured down embankment onto I-676, halting traffic in both directions. The demonstration ended a few minutes later with Philadelphia police using tear gas canisters and pepper spray to disperse the crowd, according to videos that spread quickly online. Viewers around the world expressed shock and outrage at the sight of demonstrators struggling to escape a fenced portion of the highway trench as officers continued to gas the area. They just got us all pretty good. The parkway is a mess right now. pic.twitter.com/RAO049eM82 — Jeff Neiburg (@Jeff_Neiburg) June 1, 2020 In a joint statement issued by Mayor Jim Kenney’s office shortly before midnight Monday, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said law enforcement on site had no choice. Outlaw said an unnamed incident commander on the ground ordered tear gas delivered because a Pennsylvania state trooper was trapped in his patrol vehicle on the highway and surrounded by protesters, some of whom allegedly pelted law enforcement with rocks from an overpass. “While on the roadway, the crowd surrounded a state trooper, who was alone and seated in his vehicle, and began rocking the vehicle, with the trooper having no safe means of egress,” she said in a prepared statement. “The SWAT officers gave numerous orders for the crowd to disperse, to which the crowd did not comply.” Mayor Kenney and Outlaw cosigned the use of tear gas while raising questions about a separate incident in which a SWAT trooper was seen pepper-spraying kneeling protesters in the face. Both said the entire encounter would be fully investigated. But neither Kenney’s office nor Outlaw could immediately produce evidence showing any hostile actions had actually occurred. “We’re still gathering information,” Outlaw said at a Tuesday press conference. Many protesters who were there, like 31-year-old Fishtown resident Kara Khan, disputed the city’s version of events. “It’s appalling,” Khan said of the mayor’s office statement. “I have not seen any evidence that is true. It’s really shocking and hurtful watching the mayor lie.” Aerial footage does show some protesters moving past a lone Pennsylvania State Police vehicle in a gridlocked eastbound traffic lane –– but does not show individuals tampering with the vehicle. Later, a state trooper is visible outside the vehicle armed with a long gun, with Philly SWAT officers already approaching the protesters, some of whom had already begun to scatter. In one video, individuals are visible kneeling before an unidentified trooper. “No one seemed distressed. They just seemed like tough guys,” Khan said of the law enforcement present. “I didn’t see anyone throwing rocks at anybody.” Not long afterward, the crowd surged again, and SWAT teams began firing pepper pellets, with tear gas canisters following. Panicked protesters struggled to climb up the embankments, abandoning bicycles and backpacks to escape the gas. Some were trapped in the highway trench, unable to get over the fence before the gas hit them. Others in the back who couldn’t see police shooting tear gas said they thought protesters were running to escape oncoming cars—a similar event occurred on a Minneapolis highway taken over by protesters a few days ago. At the Tuesday press conference, Kenney said his office stood by their initial description of what transpired. “We stand by that statement about a state trooper being surrounded in his vehicles,” he said. In his initial statement supporting the use of teargas, Kenney indicated he had been “disturbed” by the footage he had seen of the protest. But Mike Dunn, a spokesperson for the mayor, later clarified the mayor had not actually seen footage of protesters rocking the vehicle or throwing projectiles. “The Mayor, in using the term ‘footage,’ was referring to video publicly broadcast by news organizations and on social media,” Dunn said. “The Mayor never said he saw the vehicle being rocked back and forth; that specific moment was referenced by the Commissioner. He said he saw footage of the incident that was disturbing.” Dunn could not confirm that the state police vehicle visible in aerial videos was the one in question –– or even where the vehicle in question was located. A state trooper spokesperson said the agency could also not immediately verify the specific details from Outlaw’s statement. A statement from the state police about the incident does not reference protesters throwing rocks or tampering with a trooper’s vehicle. “Law enforcement encountered a very difficult situation in a roadway that could have resulted in harm to protesters or motorists, and we, collectively, took steps to mitigate the risk to everyone on the road,” said spokesperson Ryan Tarkowski.",0.0

The group started its march at the Kohl's at the Toms River Center shopping center where members of Toms River police and the Ocean County Sheriff's Office handed out water and hand sanitizer to the marchers. Police also arranged for buses to take the marchers back to the shopping center. The group was joined by officers from both agencies, including police Chief Mitch Little and Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billimer, both of whom are white, along with protest organizer Katrina Garcia, who held a banner during the march. The march ended at the Ocean County Courthouse where the group chanted ""black lives matter."" Garcia, who is not part of any organization, put the march together after watching the video of Floyd crying for his mother while he lied facedown with Officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck. ""I lost my mother when I was 9-years-old. I had to be a voice for my two children and for the community and the youth of this community. That's why I felt I had to do this. This was my purpose. For awareness, for peace, equality, unity, all of us to stick together,"" the 29-year-old told WOBM News. ""The changes I would like to see are continuous change. I would love for Martin Luther King's dream to become our reality for real, for real and not just to end with Tuesday's march,"" Garcia said. Little praised Garcia for how she organized the rally. ""She wanted to get all the best people from our community together to show support. We want to show support for what we all believe in in the community. I couldn't be more proud of this community right for the way everyone came together peacefully, we all walked peacefully, we had a nice demonstration downtown peacefully and we all dispersed peacefully,"" Little said. Little said no outside organizations were part of the march. Rumors has swirled about the protest turning violent. leading two downtown stores to board up their windows. The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office issued a statement that there was no evidence suggesting the march would turn violent. ""It was a peaceful march. It was important for us to send a message from law enforcement in Ocean County and throughout New Jersey that we stand with peaceful protesters and we appreciate their right to protest,"" Billhimer said. He said that law enforcement and the community are on the same side about what happened to George Floyd but there is a difference in opinion in how to protest against it. ""I think we proved that here today, and hopefully we can set an example for the rest of the country and for the state, that peaceful demonstrations are possible. Law enforcement, we were happy to walk with them and we're proud to be here today,"" Billhimer said. Marches are also scheduled for Highland Park, Morristown, Ocean City, Parsippany and South Brunswick on Tuesday. Tom Trembly and Kevin Williams contributed to this report.",0.0

Morristown Daily Record PARSIPPANY — The Patel family left a case of water outside their driveway, but feared it wouldn't be enough for the thousand people marching outside their home. ""I have never seen this many people here before,"" a family member said. A protester walked by and approached the family. ""This is the coolest thing Parsippany has ever done,"" he said as he grabbed a bottle of water before rejoining the march. Hundreds representing a number of generations gathered outside Parsippany High School on Tuesday to demand justice for George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man killed at the hands of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. The officer was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Protesters hold signs citing George Floyd's last words before he was killed by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. (Photo: Jessie Gomez) Parsippany residents and organizers Mitchell Petit-Frere, Jabari Jackson and Maurice Matthias said it was the first time they had ever planned a protest. ""I had no idea this would become so big,"" Matthias said as he addressed the crowd of more than 1,200. ""I can't just do nothing after seeing [George Floyd] die. This brings me to tears, because my father has to worry about me when I go for a run or for a drive. They worry about me because I'm a black man."" Aside from justice for Floyd, organizers are demanding the implementation of an anti-racism curriculum in the Parsippany school district and anti-racism and de-escalation training for all township law enforcement officers.

More: Hundreds gather in Morristown to demand justice for George Floyd and end police brutality With the help of Black Lives Matter Morristown and immigrant rights group Wind of the Spirit, protesters were told to stand in lines, ensuring that they were 6 feet apart. Wind of the Spirit Lead Organizer Brian Lozano led the first chant. ""No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA,"" Lozano yelled. The crowd made its way down Vail Road as neighbors stood outside their homes and used their cellphones to record the swarms of protesters holding signs and chanting Floyd's name. A family watched through their window as Parsippany resident Chandu Bhorani knelt and raised his hands in front of protesters. ""Look at this — it's beautiful! I'm here to support them,"" Bhorani said. On the sidelines, demonstrators kept off residents' lawn. Many residents left cases of water outside their homes for protesters to grab. Parsippany police officers waved at the crowd and a Morris County sheriff's officer high-fived a protester. A group of elderly residents sat outside Vail Manor, and one made the sign for peace with his fingers. A bystander thanked the crowd for marching outside his home. ""Thank you, white folks,"" he said. Marchers made their way across Route 46 and into Veterans Memorial Park, filling an empty field. The marchers knelt and held their fists in the air as they chanted Floyd's name. The crowd heard from Wind of the Spirit Co-president Karol Ruiz, organizers and local clergy, including Pastor Charles Perez and the Rev. Sidney Williams, who said he was tired of thoughts and prayers. ""We are tired of being sick and tired. Let freedom ring!"" he said as the crowd cheered. Demonstrators hold their fists up in the air and kneel while chanting ""George Floyd."" (Photo: Jessie Gomez) Black Lives Matter Morristown co-founders T'Anna Kimbrough and Oliver Starnes spoke about the killings of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by Minnesota police during a motor vehicle stop, and Alton Sterling, who was shot by police in Louisiana. Kimbrough recalled the last moments before Floyd's death. ""He called for his momma! I can't breathe!"" she yelled. A student read her school essay on racism. She talked about the moments of racism she experienced as a Muslim woman and about the killings of young black men. Those in the crowd teared up as they clapped for each speaker. By the end of the evening, protesters were encouraged to ""keep the momentum going"" and continue their education on racial injustices and police reforms. ""Already, after Newark, Morristown, Jersey City, Paterson, Randolph and Parsippany rose up, already New Jersey is implementing reforms. There will be more. The people demand more. That's why we do what we do,"" Ruiz said. Jessie Gomez is a local reporter for DailyRecord.com and NorthJersey.com.

USA TODAY Jon Bon Jovi has paused, but he didn't hashtag. That's a good thing, say critics of the music industry-wide movement called “The Show Must Be Paused,” hashtag #thshowmustbepaused, that’s meant to reflect on the events of the past week related to the death of George Floyd and the issue of institutional racism in the United States. It's also known as “Blackout Tuesday.” Bon Jovi, like other participants, posted a blank black screen on his social media platforms on Tuesday. He included #theshowmustbepaused in the lower center of the screen. A man screams with emotion as he sees a policeman take a knee while hundreds protest the death of George Floyd next to the White House on May 31, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo: ROBERTO SCHMIDT, AFP via Getty Images) But Bon Jovi did not include a hashtag #blacklivesmatter, or any other hashtags, in the description or comments and that's a good thing, according to critics who say that doing so ties up the lines of communication of the Black Lives Movement in a time of urgency among national protests. “We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message,” said Black Lives Matter activist Kenidra Woods on Twitter on Tuesday. “We use hashtag to keep ppl updated.

Delaware News Journal Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement Tuesday that ""silence is not an option,"" after leading an emotional discussion on race relations in the team's virtual meeting the day before.

Systemic racism, discrimination, violence and oppression of minorities – it has been our past and it is our present. It remains who we are. We need to be honest with ourselves and own that."" Lurie goes on to say that ""many of us, myself included, cannot truly understand the burden of a weight we have never had to carry through life. We must at least try, as best we can, to imagine ourselves as the person who is hurting, neglected and oppressed."" Lurie has always been among the more progressive NFL owners, often standing with former Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins in his efforts to point out social injustices both in Philadelphia and around the country. Still, Lurie was mostly silent when Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem in the 2016 season to bring awareness of police brutality. Kaepernick has not been signed by any team since the end of that season, and many players believe that he has been blackballed by the league. During that time, Jenkins would raise his fist during the anthem. Lurie supported that, saying Jenkins backed up his protests with his actions in the community.

Gannett KEANSBURG - Hundreds of protesters gathered here Tuesday night at the Beachway, a bayside boardwalk, and marched down to the police headquarters, where several officers joined them by taking a knee in honor of George Floyd. The crowd waved signs and chanted slogans that by now are becoming routine — black lives matter; no justice, no peace; I can't breathe — before heading home peacefully as the 8 p.m. curfew arrived. ""Things don’t change,"" said Ladier Holman, a borough resident, while marching down Beachway Avenue with his 4-year-old daughter, Dalonni. ""That’s the reason everybody in every state in every community is all getting together and doing these rallies."" Protesters gathered in Keansburg on June 2 to protest the killing of George Floyd. (Photo: Michael Diamond) The ""Keansburg Stands with George Floyd"" protest was one of several at the Jersey Shore and nationwide in recent days. Floyd died while handcuffed as a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. Floyd's death set off a wave of protests — many violent — across the United States over the past several days. Keansburg is a small town on the Bayshore with a population of about 10,000, and it has only recently shown signs of an economic recovery that was delayed by superstorm Sandy in 2012. George Floyd:Police march with protesters march in Toms River Earlier:Freehold marches for George Floyd More:Charges dropped for APP reporter arrested at George Floyd protest The demonstration was put together quickly by Gabi Bellotti, Anthony Viera and Demi Ardic who have deep ties to the borough and felt compelled by recent deaths of black men and women at the hands of police officers to speak out. Viera, 28, who grew up in Keansburg and now lives in Perth Amboy, said they met with Keansburg police officials, mapped out their plan and got support from the department in return. ""I’m not shocked,"" Viera said before the rally started. ""We came together during Sandy. We came together after 9/11. And this is another instance where we come together."" By the time of the rally, 189 responded on their Facebook invitation that they planned to go. And it seemed like all of the 299 that said they were interested showed up at the last minute. The crowd was diverse, young and old, white, black and Latinx. They started in front of La Playa, a Mexican restaurant, wound their way north up Beachway Avenue, made a sharp left onto Carr Avenue, for a 2-mile trek to police headquarters. They held signs that said: ""We See You"" and ""I Stand With You"" and ""Don't Make Our Children Grow Up With Racism."" A small handful out of the hundreds, however, held signs with expletives or the letters ACAB, a common acronym for the anti-police phrase ""all cops are b------s,"" despite the organizers' pleas for a peaceful, constructive demonstration with local police present as allies rather than obstacles. Along the way, neighbors came out of their homes, themselves holding signs and raising fists and revving motorcycle engines. Protesters urge police to take a knee with them at a protest against George Floyd's killing in Keansburg on June 2. (Photo: Michael Diamond) Keith Kmiotek, 23, of Hazlet, stood on the sidewalk with friends, handing out water bottles. He said he knew it was a small act of kindness, but thought maybe it could cascade into something larger. Sister Sharon Kelly, 66, of Keansburg, stood outside St. Ann's Convent on Carr Avenue, holding a sign that read: ""We see you, love you and stand with you."" ""To see people claiming their power, I think it's great,"" Kelly said. The noise began to build in front of the Keansburg police station just before 7 p.m., when the crowd took a knee and demanded that the officers do the same — a symbolic gesture in the protesters' eyes that police acknowledge they aren't above the law. Some in the crowd began to press in on the officers and supervisors, but the organizers and other protesters prevailed in calming them down. A cheer broke out when at several of the officers present took a knee as well, some of them arm-and-arm with the protesters. That, it turned out, was enough. The demonstrators turned around and began to walk again, past the Circle K and Mr. Pete's Laundromat, past Cove on the Bay waterfront apartments. They said they were angry. Rasheed Singh, 34, of Keansburg, said he has spent the past weeks placing deceased coronavirus patients into coffins without extra pay and minimum protective equipment. It was a sign that the march wan't just about police; it was about economic opportunity as well. ""We’ve got to believe in ourselves again,"" Singh said. ""We, as people, as human beings have got to believe in ourselves again."" The march ended where it began. And the crowd went home as the curfew came, averting a confrontation with police that has turned many peaceful demonstrations violent. George Hoff, a former mayor and current councilman, said he wasn't surprised. The borough has invested time and energy trying to build connections between the schools and the police department for 15 years. ""We’re building a good rapport with the community, and that’s where it starts,"" he said. ""Building relationships, making sure our voices are heard, and you get this. A peaceful demonstration.""

Bridgewater Courier News Neighboring New Brunswick, North Brunswick and South Brunswick saw nonviolent Black Lives Matter marches Tuesday afternoon in reaction to the May 25 police slaying of George Floyd, as well as other unarmed black people in recent months. The marches were conducted in cooperation with local law enforcement. About 1,000 people turned out in total, organizers said. ""The reason why I wanted to start the march was not only for the sentimental aspect of police brutality and the death of George Floyd, but the fact that after attending a Franklin march for justice, I was inspired to share my experience and knowledge that I have learned during my time at the march,"" said Timir Summers, 20, co-organizer of the South Brunswick event. ""On that Sunday morning, I created the event ... on Facebook, and from there, children from South Brunswick re-posted my event on every single social media platform."" EARLIER: Peaceful march in Franklin supports lives lost, protests racial injustices More than 500 participated in a Black Lives Matter march on Tuesday in South Brunswick to protest the killing of George Floyd and several other unarmed African Americans in recent months, as well as the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on the black community. (Photo: ~Courtesy of South Brunswick Police) Summers was helped by his friend and South Brunswick neighbor Mehlnae Pittman and her father, Tormel, a longtime local activist for social justice, particularly in his hometown of New Brunswick. Their march began with a rally at Crossroads North Middle School in the Monmouth Junction and continued for two hours on Georges Road and other parts of the township. In New Brunswick and North Brunswick, a march organized by New Brunswick students was preceded by a North Brunswick Township resolution condemning racial injustice. The march made its way from New Brunswick Middle School on Livingston Avenue in New Brunswick, down Hermann Road to North Township Hall, then to Joyce Kilmer Avenue and city hall in New Brunswick. “There was no question to the level of support we were going to offer the demonstrators,” North Brunswick Public Safety Director Kenneth McCormick said in a statement. “This was beyond public safety. This was public support. We are all on the same side of this issue.” Jocelyn and Jalisa Watson, sisters from New Brunswick who participated in the march, said they appreciated the support of local police. But as the granddaughters of Herbert Middleton, the longest-living black officer retired from the New Brunswick police force, they said they were disappointed in both police forces. ""They did show support 100 percent blocking the roads to make sure we were safe walking where we going, but I did want them to speak out a little bit to let us know in that moment how they felt, and I would have loved to see them take a knee,"" Jocelyn Watson said. ""I know that some have different views, but if you're a united force, it should not be a problem speaking out to be able to support us. I'm disappointed that they didn't really talk to us. They just watched us protest. It would have taken two seconds to make us feel like we were doing the right thing."" Jalisa Watson pointed out that North Brunswick police would not allow the march to continue onto Georges Road and turned the marchers back to New Brunswick. She said that in New Brunswick, marchers were granted greater access to roads. ""Once we got into North Brunswick, it felt like the police were just watching us, like we were interrupting their shift and this was a burden to them,"" Jalisa Watson said. ""It felt like they didn't want the people to be in their town. As neighboring cities, many people shop, work and have multiple events in each part of town. If this was a multiple-district protest, why wouldn't they let us go onto Georges Road?"" Mayor Francis ""Mac"" Womack attended the justice march with new Councilwoman Claribel Cortes, the first Latina elected to the township council. In a statement, Womack said township leaders were appalled by the video depicting Floyd's death by asphyxiation as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt with his knee pressed on Floyd’s neck. ""We not only are moved to call for justice for Mr. Floyd, but we are called to pray for his family and peace throughout the land,” Womack stated.

Last weekend, Pittman organized a demonstration in New Brunswick, where a decade ago, he led nationally recognized protests against the police shooting of Barry Deloatch, also an unarmed black man. ""I hope it has a culture change of peaceful nonviolent protest that continues on,"" he said. ""It can't get any worse for blacks. I hope we're headed in the right direction. It has to get better."" A graduate of South Brunswick High School now attending Middlesex County College, Mehlnae Pittman said she helped Summers organize the march because she wants to see a better world for her younger sister and brother. She and her father said they plan to organize more Black Lives Matter events. ""These are my streets,"" Mehlnae Pittman said. ""This is where I live. I went to school here. If I'm out here at the age I am, I'll inspire others to come out. I hope that everyone goes out into their streets and lifts their voices up so they can be heard. That's the only way anything is going to change."" The local protests are among many nationwide in support of Floyd and other unarmed black people killed by police. The black community also has been disproportionately devastated by the pandemic, according to health statistics. More Black Lives Matter events are scheduled in Central Jersey, including in Old Bridge, Sayreville, Linden and Clark. Later Tuesday, a rally and march was held in Highland Park with about 1,000 diverse participants. READ: Peaceful march in Highland Park honors George Floyd North Brunswick resolution After a series of social media posts by Womack throughout the week and a joint statement of outrage this past weekend, the mayor and township council on Monday night unanimously adopted a strongly worded resolution condemning the actions of Chauvin. The resolution also is critical of three other Minneapolis police officers who are accused of being complicate by their department.

Asbury Park Press FREEHOLD - Tension flared at the Hall of Records on Main Street Tuesday as protesters gathered in reaction to the slaying of George Floyd. But after the simmering emotions subsided, the event continued peacefully, drawing about 300. It stood in contrast to a night of protests in Asbury Park Monday, where Asbury Park Press reporter Gustavo Martinez Contreras was tackled and collared by police while filming the arrests of two juveniles. Charges against the reporter were dropped and state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal later apologized to him. REPORTER ARRESTED: Cory Booker: arrest of APP journalist unacceptable For a look at the scene of the protest, scroll to the video above. The Freehold protest began at 3 p.m. with people carrying signs and using chalk to write messages on the pavement such as “Please don’t let me die,” and “White silence equals violence.” Protesters drew a steady stream of support from people driving by in cars, trucks and motorcycles blowing their horns.

(Photo: David Rivera/Staff Photo) Asia Simms, 20, of Freehold organized the Black Lives Matter event with family and friends. “We’ve seen a lot of protests and some were peaceful and others had problems,” she said. “We organized this because we wanted to have one that was peaceful in Freehold.” Simms said she and others coordinated the event with Freehold police. Officers stood off on the sidelines at the Hall. Chalimar Ramey-Fisher, 41, of Freehold, urged the police to eliminate racial prejudice on the force.

Somebody with a badge on has made them uncomfortable at some point in their life. It is up to law enforcement in our community to protect our community to create that dialogue with them, assure them that that’s not (where) they’re coming from, and to dispel the fear.” Buy Photo Protesters gathered at the Monmouth County Hall of Records in Freehold in honor of George Floyd. (Photo: David Rivera/Staff Photo) As the crowd grew, protesters converged on the officers and chanted “take a knee.” The officers declined. And then tension flared between organizers and protesters taking a more aggressive stance. Some angry words were exchanged between the two groups and then briefly between the more confrontational protesters and the police. But calm prevailed and the crowd headed to the Monmouth County Courthouse down the street. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. There, Pastor Vester Dock of the New Hope Baptist Church in Freehold told the group that the one thing state and local authorities must do is stop what he called “code blue” —– cover-ups of police brutality. “If you don’t get code blue changed immediately, you’ll be right back here,” he said. Dock, 79, also advocated for less confrontation with the police. Buy Photo Pastor Vester Dock of New Hope Baptist Church in Freehold prays along with Freehold Borough Police Chief Craig W.

A memo obtained by Billy Penn and WHYY shows officers will be required to report all use of force live on their radios, rather than as procedural paperwork after the fact. “Effective immediately, and until notified otherwise, all uses of force must be reported via Police Radio, to ensure we can properly defend our actions when we are ultimately challenged,” Outlaw wrote in the department-wide memorandum. On Monday, officers tear-gassed an otherwise peaceful crowd that had descended into the I-676 interstate during one of the many protests of police violence and racism that have swept the city and nation. Officers discharged canisters at a mass of protesters who were trapped on the highway trench with nowhere to run. In one widely circulated video, an officer can be seen ripping off protesters’ facemasks in order to pepper-spray them at close range. In the memo, Outlaw noted the department hasn’t used “less-than-lethal munitions” in recent history. She also hinted at the recent arrests of several local journalists, instructing rank-and-file police to allow reporters to do their jobs “unless extenuating circumstances exist.” In two separate incidents since Sunday, officers detained WHYY education reporter Avi Wolfman-Arent and Inquirer education reporter Kristen Graham. Both identified themselves as press who were on assignment covering protests. Despite these two reporters’ association with recognizable news outlets, Outlaw noted that in general officers might find it “hard to define the ‘press,’” but instructed police to be “as accommodating as possible…even when we have a curfew.” “If you are uncertain about who is considered to be a member of the press, contact a supervisor for directions,” the top cop wrote. “Please remember, the press are not only entitled to access, they have a right to it.”",0.0
1623753238,2020-06-02 19:22:58,Why didn’t Philly police respond to white men with bats? Fishtown neighbors wait for answers,https://whyy.org/articles/why-didnt-philly-police-respond-to-white-men-with-bats-fishtown-neighbors-wait-for-answers/,en,False,,265424,New Jersey — NewsWorks,http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/new-jersey,"Kara Khan and her boyfriend, Matthew Willams, slept at a friend’s house in another neighborhood Monday night because they were so shaken by the group’s actions. Williams said one of the men threw him off his bike, then kicked and punched him in the face before threatening him with a bat as he and others loomed over him as he lay on the ground, bleeding. Williams said he was attacked after being separated from Khan, who stopped her bike after one of the men tried to hit the couple with full water bottles. This, after they mistakenly thought the group was part of the Justice for George Floyd protests, and raised their fists in solidarity, said Khan. Khan said some of the men also threatened her with baseball bats and hurled insults at her as she moved past them and away from Girard Avenue. She said one man called her a “porno b–ch.” “It sucks not to feel safe in your neighborhood,” said Khan, who has lived in Fishtown for six years. During a news conference on Tuesday, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her department was in no way supportive of the group that gathered outside the 26th Police District the night before. “I didn’t ask them to do that, I don’t welcome that, I don’t invite them to come back, and we don’t need them,” said Outlaw. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who made a career defending protesters before he became the city’s top prosecutor, issued a statement on the incident Tuesday night. “I want to be clear: violence and threats and disorderly acts of hatred will not be tolerated by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office,” he said. “People who do it will be prosecuted, as will anyone who helps them cause harm. They are the problem, not the solution; they are the danger, not the peaceful protesters.” The police department is still investigating the gathering, including what happened to WHYY producer Jon Ehrens, who said three or four of the men attacked him on Thompson Street after several police squad cars and a tank arrived at the scene to prod everyone to go home. The men, who also shoved Ehrens’ girlfriend, chased after him when they noticed him recording them with his smartphone, said Ehrens, who was not reporting for the public radio station at the time. An ambulance took Ehrens to the hospital, where he was treated for a broken nose. His left eye is swollen shut. “I didn’t see the police inciting violence, but perhaps they could have done a better job at dispersing the crowd quicker,” said Ehrens. It’s unclear whether members of the group were Fishtown residents or if any of them are affiliated with any particular group. Police can be seen in a video Ehrens posted to Twitter arresting a Black man at one point during the night, but neighbors say officers did not detain any of the white men part of the gathering outside the police district, which they said sends a clear signal about what behavior the department is — and isn’t — willing to tolerate. Asked Tuesday why police didn’t arrest anyone from the group for violating the citywide curfew or for allegedly assaulting Williams, Ehrens and his girlfriend, Outlaw didn’t immediately have an answer. “That’s a very good question, and I’ll have an answer to that, not at this moment, at some point later today as we look more into how that unfolded,” she said. As of Tuesday night, the department still had not recorded any arrests of the men involved, according to Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew, a department spokesperson. However, earlier in the day, police arrested dozens of protestors who broke off from a massive demonstration to shut down traffic on I-676. The police department, which claimed they used the tear gas after some of the protesters threw rocks at officers and rocked a police vehicle back and forth with a trooper inside, made the arrests after firing tear tear gas at the protesters blocking the highway. Police continued to use tear gas as some of them struggled to climb a steep, fenced enbankment on the side of the expressway. (The department has since revised its use-of-force guidelines. Officers are now required to report all use of force live on their radios, rather than as procedural paperwork after the fact, according to a memo obtained by WHYY and Billy Penn.) “That was the most upsetting thing,” said Khan, who photographed the protest in Center City. “To watch cops stand up and protect people who are being actually violent towards us for no reason was just like, ‘What world do we live in?’” Kinebrew said the department knows Khan is not the only person who feels the police treated the men in Fishtown differently. “We are aware of that perception, take it seriously and are investigating this matter. [Internal Affairs] has initiated an investigation of the events near the 26th Street District, so it’s too early to provide further comment,” said Kinebrew.",0.0

Dorothy Patterson spoke out against Board of Ed Trustee Michael Alonso during an emergency meeting Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. × Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. An emergency Bayonne Board of Education meeting was held on June 2 at 9 a.m. to address comments made by one of its members. Trustee Michael Alonso has sparked controversy after a social media post that many view as racist and an incitement to violence. He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Most of the Board of Education was present at the meeting in-person, except Trustee Ava Finnerty and Alonso himself. Prior to the start of the meeting, Trustee Joseph Broderick asked Rev. Dorothy Patterson of Wallace Temple AME Zion Church in Bayonen to lead everyone in prayer. “Will you bring us to place of peace, oh God, and not hatred?” Rev. Patterson said in her prayer. Residents in uproar Before the board addressed the issue, president of the Bayonne’s Teachers Association Gene Woods spoke vehemently against Trustee Alonso’s comments at the meeting. “I pity him for what he believes,” Woods said, stressing that Alonso needs to be “reeducated.” Woods said that Alonso was in violation of school board policy and the school ethics act for his post as well as “past racist posts.” “We find Mr. Alonso’s post racist, inciting riot behavior, and inappropriate,” Woods said, calling on Alonso to resign. Two residents also submitted written comment to the board secretary who read the comments aloud at the meeting. “As taxpayer, I feel Alonso doesn’t not have the ability to make decisions that positively impact our school district,” Gina Pirazzari wrote. Another resident, Carolyn Schultz, said that this was not the first time he has posted a racial slur or comment on social media, violating board member use of social networks. To ensure this type of behavior never happens again, Schultz suggested cultural training for school board members. Outrage across the board Afterwards, the board voted to adopt a resolution condemning the killing of George Floyd as well as Alonso’s racist comments. Before voting in favor of the resolution, Trustee Broderick said that Alonso only caused more problems than any good he thought he might have been doing. He iterated the need for more classes and greater education on racial issues. Trustee Lisa Burke said that Alonso doesn’t have the best interest for the community and thinks he should be removed. “We should be doing all we can to pull our community together, not insinuating or inciting any kind of violence,” Burke said. Trustee Jodi Casais, who spoke out against the post initially on social media, urged residents to vote Alonso out in November. “If I said I was shocked and appalled at his posts, I’d be lying,” Casais said, adding that this was predictable behavior from Alonso. Trustee Jan Patrick Egan said that the community has to teach love and respect to its children, not division and hate. Egan said that Alonso’s absence from the emergency meeting regarding his comments speaks volumes about the situation, declining to call on Alonso to resign out of respect to voters. Vice President Christopher Munoz said he would no longer refer to Alonso as Trustee Alonso. Munoz said that through the posts, Alonso has lost the privilege and honor to be called a Trustee of the Board of Education. Voting in favor of the resolution, Munoz said that Alonso doesn’t have best interest of Bayonne’s children or the city at heart. “We are family and I think Alonso violated that trust,” Munoz said. “I am demanding, not asking, for his resignation.” Last to speak was President Maria Valado who agreed with all the comments by other trustees, adding that board members must be held to a higher standard. “As elected officials we are charged with a duty of safeguarding and protecting the minds and bodies of the most vulnerable in our society: our children,” Valado said, calling for Alonso’s resignation. “Step aside. There are others in our community who are so willing and able to stand up and protect our children.” Before voting in favor of the resolution, Valado added that the board is supposed to represent the community and that these comments don’t do that. A righteous ultimatum Rev. Patterson thanked the board for holding the emergency meeting to show that the issue is important, but ultimately questioned the point of such meeting if the board was not going to implement any change. Beginning with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King’s speech on the work that needs to be done in terms of race relations, Rev. Patterson said that we are still dealing with the evils of racism today. Having heard what everyone said, Rev. Patterson made it clear that she and all Black Americans have a right to be angry. “If you allow him to stay on this board, you have now put a knee on the neck of every African American in this city,” Rev. Patterson said. She challenged the board to go beyond what they were told was possible and remove Alonso, doing not just the right thing but also what she said was the righteous thing to do. “I came here today hoping I can leave here and breathe,” Patterson said of the figurative knee being held on her neck by Alonso remaining on the board. Rev. Patterson also urged all board members and other staff present to be front and center at any protests in Bayonne. “If you’re not walking with us, you’re standing somewhere against us,” Rev. Patterson said. “We are #BayonneStrong. But if we are wrong on this, we will be #BayonneWrong forever.” Ethics complaints ahead However, Patterson’s pleas to remove Alonso fell on deaf ears, prompting Woods to return to the podium. Woods began questioning what can be done, as any member of the BTA would be removed under the social media acceptable use policy if they posted anything of the sort. Woods added he would not only walk with protestors if they marched in Bayonne, but would also become an “agitator” at every corner if Alonso doesn’t resign or won’t be removed. “He cannot remain, we must come together and decide what to do to get him removed,” Woods said. Trustee Dennis Wilbeck then interjected, adding that while it’s almost impossible for the board to remove Alonso here, an ethics charge can be brought against him. However, due to COVID-19, the Dept. of Education would probably not be able to review the case until November. In which case, the easier solution may be to have voters speak their minds at the polls also in November, as Alonso is up for re-election this year. Rev. Patterson underscored that something needs to happen now, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Valado, agreed with Rev Patterson, in turn suggesting residents file ethics complaints against Alonso. “Ethics complaints can be filed and everyone in the community should,” Valado said. “One ethics complaint sends a message, 100 complaints send and even louder message.” Breaking into tears, President Valado expressed her daily thoughts about what must be going through her students’ heads, many of whom are African American. At the end of the meeting, Valado vowed to march with any protestors in Bayonne. “When we have a protest, I am with you. We are with you walking, right at the front,” Valado said. “It’s time to end the social injustice in our nation.” Alonso responds Despite his absence from the meeting, Alonso addressed the controversy in a statement to The Bayonne Community News. “My post was about Bayonne’s economic viability; an intellectual discussion on why we won’t have looting since we don’t have any stores,” Alonso said. According to Alonso, people in the city have been complaining for years about no stores to shop in. Alonso also clarified that he only advocates for peaceful protest. “I am an advocate of peaceful protest, but rioting and looting should not be tolerated,” Alonso continued, iterating his support for President Trump. “No one is thinking about keeping our kids safe. They are just thinking about their re-election.” In addition, Alonso outlined his support for a city-wide protest including board members. “We should all protest together, the board; the kids, teachers, parents, the police and the mayor!” Alonso said. Alonso does not plan to resign from the Board of Education, leaving it up to the voters to decide in November.

Because of this mantra, I can never and will never say that I know how the family of George Floyd feels or how the African-American community feels.” Demonstrations continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans, specifically the death of George Floyd by police. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from Trenton to Newark. However, some unrest occurred in Trenton when a police car was set on fire, hours after local officers marched alongside the protesters during the day. In Bayonne, there have been no protests yet. However, one local elected official has caused outrage and now faces calls to resign after a Facebook post about the Floyd protests that many residents consider racist. Strength in diversity A former captain on the Bayonne Police Department for 28 years, Mayor Davis said Floyd should still be alive today. “The killing of George Floyd should have never happened,” Mayor Davis said. “I’m not sure how any human being could have that little compassion for another human being.” Mayor Davis watched the video of what happened to Floyd in Minnesota and said he felt anger and confusion. “In Bayonne, we need to be cognizant of our diversity and we must embrace it,” Davis said. “This diversity is what gives us strength. If we work together and accept each other as brothers and sisters in humanity, we can avoid the pitfalls seen in these horrible examples of inhumanity.” Mayor Davis said he is confident that Bayonne will be the example of compassion and brotherhood for which other cities strive.

Dorothy Patterson spoke out against Board of Ed Trustee Michael Alonso during an emergency meeting Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. × Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. An emergency Bayonne Board of Education meeting was held on June 2 at 9 a.m. to address comments made by one of its members. Trustee Michael Alonso has sparked controversy after a social media post that many view as racist and an incitement to violence. He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Most of the Board of Education was present at the meeting in-person, except Trustee Ava Finnerty and Alonso himself. Prior to the start of the meeting, Trustee Joseph Broderick asked Rev. Dorothy Patterson of Wallace Temple AME Zion Church in Bayonen to lead everyone in prayer. “Will you bring us to place of peace, oh God, and not hatred?” Rev. Patterson said in her prayer. Residents in uproar Before the board addressed the issue, president of the Bayonne’s Teachers Association Gene Woods spoke vehemently against Trustee Alonso’s comments at the meeting. “I pity him for what he believes,” Woods said, stressing that Alonso needs to be “reeducated.” Woods said that Alonso was in violation of school board policy and the school ethics act for his post as well as “past racist posts.” “We find Mr. Alonso’s post racist, inciting riot behavior, and inappropriate,” Woods said, calling on Alonso to resign. Two residents also submitted written comment to the board secretary who read the comments aloud at the meeting. “As taxpayer, I feel Alonso doesn’t not have the ability to make decisions that positively impact our school district,” Gina Pirazzari wrote. Another resident, Carolyn Schultz, said that this was not the first time he has posted a racial slur or comment on social media, violating board member use of social networks. To ensure this type of behavior never happens again, Schultz suggested cultural training for school board members. Outrage across the board Afterwards, the board voted to adopt a resolution condemning the killing of George Floyd as well as Alonso’s racist comments. Before voting in favor of the resolution, Trustee Broderick said that Alonso only caused more problems than any good he thought he might have been doing. He iterated the need for more classes and greater education on racial issues. Trustee Lisa Burke said that Alonso doesn’t have the best interest for the community and thinks he should be removed. “We should be doing all we can to pull our community together, not insinuating or inciting any kind of violence,” Burke said. Trustee Jodi Casais, who spoke out against the post initially on social media, urged residents to vote Alonso out in November. “If I said I was shocked and appalled at his posts, I’d be lying,” Casais said, adding that this was predictable behavior from Alonso. Trustee Jan Patrick Egan said that the community has to teach love and respect to its children, not division and hate. Egan said that Alonso’s absence from the emergency meeting regarding his comments speaks volumes about the situation, declining to call on Alonso to resign out of respect to voters. Vice President Christopher Munoz said he would no longer refer to Alonso as Trustee Alonso. Munoz said that through the posts, Alonso has lost the privilege and honor to be called a Trustee of the Board of Education. Voting in favor of the resolution, Munoz said that Alonso doesn’t have best interest of Bayonne’s children or the city at heart. “We are family and I think Alonso violated that trust,” Munoz said. “I am demanding, not asking, for his resignation.” Last to speak was President Maria Valado who agreed with all the comments by other trustees, adding that board members must be held to a higher standard. “As elected officials we are charged with a duty of safeguarding and protecting the minds and bodies of the most vulnerable in our society: our children,” Valado said, calling for Alonso’s resignation. “Step aside. There are others in our community who are so willing and able to stand up and protect our children.” Before voting in favor of the resolution, Valado added that the board is supposed to represent the community and that these comments don’t do that. A righteous ultimatum Rev. Patterson thanked the board for holding the emergency meeting to show that the issue is important, but ultimately questioned the point of such meeting if the board was not going to implement any change. Beginning with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King’s speech on the work that needs to be done in terms of race relations, Rev. Patterson said that we are still dealing with the evils of racism today. Having heard what everyone said, Rev. Patterson made it clear that she and all Black Americans have a right to be angry. “If you allow him to stay on this board, you have now put a knee on the neck of every African American in this city,” Rev. Patterson said. She challenged the board to go beyond what they were told was possible and remove Alonso, doing not just the right thing but also what she said was the righteous thing to do. “I came here today hoping I can leave here and breathe,” Patterson said of the figurative knee being held on her neck by Alonso remaining on the board. Rev. Patterson also urged all board members and other staff present to be front and center at any protests in Bayonne. “If you’re not walking with us, you’re standing somewhere against us,” Rev. Patterson said. “We are #BayonneStrong. But if we are wrong on this, we will be #BayonneWrong forever.” Ethics complaints ahead However, Patterson’s pleas to remove Alonso fell on deaf ears, prompting Woods to return to the podium. Woods began questioning what can be done, as any member of the BTA would be removed under the social media acceptable use policy if they posted anything of the sort. Woods added he would not only walk with protestors if they marched in Bayonne, but would also become an “agitator” at every corner if Alonso doesn’t resign or won’t be removed. “He cannot remain, we must come together and decide what to do to get him removed,” Woods said. Trustee Dennis Wilbeck then interjected, adding that while it’s almost impossible for the board to remove Alonso here, an ethics charge can be brought against him. However, due to COVID-19, the Dept. of Education would probably not be able to review the case until November. In which case, the easier solution may be to have voters speak their minds at the polls also in November, as Alonso is up for re-election this year. Rev. Patterson underscored that something needs to happen now, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Valado, agreed with Rev Patterson, in turn suggesting residents file ethics complaints against Alonso. “Ethics complaints can be filed and everyone in the community should,” Valado said. “One ethics complaint sends a message, 100 complaints send and even louder message.” Breaking into tears, President Valado expressed her daily thoughts about what must be going through her students’ heads, many of whom are African American. At the end of the meeting, Valado vowed to march with any protestors in Bayonne. “When we have a protest, I am with you. We are with you walking, right at the front,” Valado said. “It’s time to end the social injustice in our nation.” Alonso responds Despite his absence from the meeting, Alonso addressed the controversy in a statement to The Bayonne Community News. “My post was about Bayonne’s economic viability; an intellectual discussion on why we won’t have looting since we don’t have any stores,” Alonso said. According to Alonso, people in the city have been complaining for years about no stores to shop in. Alonso also clarified that he only advocates for peaceful protest. “I am an advocate of peaceful protest, but rioting and looting should not be tolerated,” Alonso continued, iterating his support for President Trump. “No one is thinking about keeping our kids safe. They are just thinking about their re-election.” In addition, Alonso outlined his support for a city-wide protest including board members. “We should all protest together, the board; the kids, teachers, parents, the police and the mayor!” Alonso said. Alonso does not plan to resign from the Board of Education, leaving it up to the voters to decide in November.

President Valado, agreed with Rev Patterson, in turn suggesting residents file ethics complaints against Alonso. “Ethics complaints can be filed and everyone in the community should,” Valado said. “One ethics complaint sends a message, 100 complaints send and even louder message.” Breaking into tears, President Valado expressed her daily thoughts about what must be going through her students’ heads, many of whom are African American. At the end of the meeting, Valado vowed to march with any protestors in Bayonne. “When we have a protest, I am with you. We are with you walking, right at the front,” Valado said. “It’s time to end the social injustice in our nation.” Alonso responds Despite his absence from the meeting, Alonso addressed the controversy in a statement to The Bayonne Community News. “My post was about Bayonne’s economic viability; an intellectual discussion on why we won’t have looting since we don’t have any stores,” Alonso said. According to Alonso, people in the city have been complaining for years about no stores to shop in. Alonso also clarified that he only advocates for peaceful protest. “I am an advocate of peaceful protest, but rioting and looting should not be tolerated,” Alonso continued, iterating his support for President Trump. “No one is thinking about keeping our kids safe. They are just thinking about their re-election.” In addition, Alonso outlined his support for a city-wide protest including board members. “We should all protest together, the board; the kids, teachers, parents, the police and the mayor!” Alonso said. Alonso does not plan to resign from the Board of Education, leaving it up to the voters to decide in November.

Dorothy Patterson spoke out against Board of Ed Trustee Michael Alonso during an emergency meeting Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. × Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. An emergency Bayonne Board of Education meeting was held on June 2 at 9 a.m. to address comments made by one of its members. Trustee Michael Alonso has sparked controversy after a social media post that many view as racist and an incitement to violence. He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Most of the Board of Education was present at the meeting in-person, except Trustee Ava Finnerty and Alonso himself. Prior to the start of the meeting, Trustee Joseph Broderick asked Rev. Dorothy Patterson of Wallace Temple AME Zion Church in Bayonen to lead everyone in prayer. “Will you bring us to place of peace, oh God, and not hatred?” Rev. Patterson said in her prayer. Residents in uproar Before the board addressed the issue, president of the Bayonne’s Teachers Association Gene Woods spoke vehemently against Trustee Alonso’s comments at the meeting. “I pity him for what he believes,” Woods said, stressing that Alonso needs to be “reeducated.” Woods said that Alonso was in violation of school board policy and the school ethics act for his post as well as “past racist posts.” “We find Mr. Alonso’s post racist, inciting riot behavior, and inappropriate,” Woods said, calling on Alonso to resign. Two residents also submitted written comment to the board secretary who read the comments aloud at the meeting. “As taxpayer, I feel Alonso doesn’t not have the ability to make decisions that positively impact our school district,” Gina Pirazzari wrote. Another resident, Carolyn Schultz, said that this was not the first time he has posted a racial slur or comment on social media, violating board member use of social networks. To ensure this type of behavior never happens again, Schultz suggested cultural training for school board members. Outrage across the board Afterwards, the board voted to adopt a resolution condemning the killing of George Floyd as well as Alonso’s racist comments. Before voting in favor of the resolution, Trustee Broderick said that Alonso only caused more problems than any good he thought he might have been doing. He iterated the need for more classes and greater education on racial issues. Trustee Lisa Burke said that Alonso doesn’t have the best interest for the community and thinks he should be removed. “We should be doing all we can to pull our community together, not insinuating or inciting any kind of violence,” Burke said. Trustee Jodi Casais, who spoke out against the post initially on social media, urged residents to vote Alonso out in November. “If I said I was shocked and appalled at his posts, I’d be lying,” Casais said, adding that this was predictable behavior from Alonso. Trustee Jan Patrick Egan said that the community has to teach love and respect to its children, not division and hate. Egan said that Alonso’s absence from the emergency meeting regarding his comments speaks volumes about the situation, declining to call on Alonso to resign out of respect to voters. Vice President Christopher Munoz said he would no longer refer to Alonso as Trustee Alonso. Munoz said that through the posts, Alonso has lost the privilege and honor to be called a Trustee of the Board of Education. Voting in favor of the resolution, Munoz said that Alonso doesn’t have best interest of Bayonne’s children or the city at heart. “We are family and I think Alonso violated that trust,” Munoz said. “I am demanding, not asking, for his resignation.” Last to speak was President Maria Valado who agreed with all the comments by other trustees, adding that board members must be held to a higher standard. “As elected officials we are charged with a duty of safeguarding and protecting the minds and bodies of the most vulnerable in our society: our children,” Valado said, calling for Alonso’s resignation. “Step aside. There are others in our community who are so willing and able to stand up and protect our children.” Before voting in favor of the resolution, Valado added that the board is supposed to represent the community and that these comments don’t do that. A righteous ultimatum Rev. Patterson thanked the board for holding the emergency meeting to show that the issue is important, but ultimately questioned the point of such meeting if the board was not going to implement any change. Beginning with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King’s speech on the work that needs to be done in terms of race relations, Rev. Patterson said that we are still dealing with the evils of racism today. Having heard what everyone said, Rev. Patterson made it clear that she and all Black Americans have a right to be angry. “If you allow him to stay on this board, you have now put a knee on the neck of every African American in this city,” Rev. Patterson said. She challenged the board to go beyond what they were told was possible and remove Alonso, doing not just the right thing but also what she said was the righteous thing to do. “I came here today hoping I can leave here and breathe,” Patterson said of the figurative knee being held on her neck by Alonso remaining on the board. Rev. Patterson also urged all board members and other staff present to be front and center at any protests in Bayonne. “If you’re not walking with us, you’re standing somewhere against us,” Rev. Patterson said. “We are #BayonneStrong. But if we are wrong on this, we will be #BayonneWrong forever.” Ethics complaints ahead However, Patterson’s pleas to remove Alonso fell on deaf ears, prompting Woods to return to the podium. Woods began questioning what can be done, as any member of the BTA would be removed under the social media acceptable use policy if they posted anything of the sort. Woods added he would not only walk with protestors if they marched in Bayonne, but would also become an “agitator” at every corner if Alonso doesn’t resign or won’t be removed. “He cannot remain, we must come together and decide what to do to get him removed,” Woods said. Trustee Dennis Wilbeck then interjected, adding that while it’s almost impossible for the board to remove Alonso here, an ethics charge can be brought against him. However, due to COVID-19, the Dept. of Education would probably not be able to review the case until November. In which case, the easier solution may be to have voters speak their minds at the polls also in November, as Alonso is up for re-election this year. Rev. Patterson underscored that something needs to happen now, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of this mantra, I can never and will never say that I know how the family of George Floyd feels or how the African-American community feels.” Demonstrations continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans, specifically the death of George Floyd by police.

If we work together and accept each other as brothers and sisters in humanity, we can avoid the pitfalls seen in these horrible examples of inhumanity.” Mayor Davis said he is confident that Bayonne will be the example of compassion and brotherhood for which other cities strive.

Alonso does not plan to resign from the Board of Education, leaving it up to the voters to decide in November.

Dorothy Patterson spoke out against Board of Ed Trustee Michael Alonso during an emergency meeting Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. × Rev. Patterson opened the meeting in a prayer. An emergency Bayonne Board of Education meeting was held on June 2 at 9 a.m. to address comments made by one of its members. Trustee Michael Alonso has sparked controversy after a social media post that many view as racist and an incitement to violence. He posted on Facebook regarding the demonstrations occurring across the country protesting the death of George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. A screenshot of the post has been circulating on social media. However, it no longer appears on Alonso’s page. “Where will the Bayonne Riot Start? Walmart- QuickChek- Shoprite?” Alonso said. In another post, Alonso shares a political cartoon of Joe Biden changing a “Black Lives Matter Sign” to “Black Votes Matter.” It has since been taken down. Most of the Board of Education was present at the meeting in-person, except Trustee Ava Finnerty and Alonso himself. Prior to the start of the meeting, Trustee Joseph Broderick asked Rev. Dorothy Patterson of Wallace Temple AME Zion Church in Bayonen to lead everyone in prayer. “Will you bring us to place of peace, oh God, and not hatred?” Rev. Patterson said in her prayer. Residents in uproar Before the board addressed the issue, president of the Bayonne’s Teachers Association Gene Woods spoke vehemently against Trustee Alonso’s comments at the meeting. “I pity him for what he believes,” Woods said, stressing that Alonso needs to be “reeducated.” Woods said that Alonso was in violation of school board policy and the school ethics act for his post as well as “past racist posts.” “We find Mr. Alonso’s post racist, inciting riot behavior, and inappropriate,” Woods said, calling on Alonso to resign. Two residents also submitted written comment to the board secretary who read the comments aloud at the meeting. “As taxpayer, I feel Alonso doesn’t not have the ability to make decisions that positively impact our school district,” Gina Pirazzari wrote. Another resident, Carolyn Schultz, said that this was not the first time he has posted a racial slur or comment on social media, violating board member use of social networks. To ensure this type of behavior never happens again, Schultz suggested cultural training for school board members. Outrage across the board Afterwards, the board voted to adopt a resolution condemning the killing of George Floyd as well as Alonso’s racist comments. Before voting in favor of the resolution, Trustee Broderick said that Alonso only caused more problems than any good he thought he might have been doing. He iterated the need for more classes and greater education on racial issues. Trustee Lisa Burke said that Alonso doesn’t have the best interest for the community and thinks he should be removed. “We should be doing all we can to pull our community together, not insinuating or inciting any kind of violence,” Burke said. Trustee Jodi Casais, who spoke out against the post initially on social media, urged residents to vote Alonso out in November. “If I said I was shocked and appalled at his posts, I’d be lying,” Casais said, adding that this was predictable behavior from Alonso. Trustee Jan Patrick Egan said that the community has to teach love and respect to its children, not division and hate. Egan said that Alonso’s absence from the emergency meeting regarding his comments speaks volumes about the situation, declining to call on Alonso to resign out of respect to voters. Vice President Christopher Munoz said he would no longer refer to Alonso as Trustee Alonso. Munoz said that through the posts, Alonso has lost the privilege and honor to be called a Trustee of the Board of Education. Voting in favor of the resolution, Munoz said that Alonso doesn’t have best interest of Bayonne’s children or the city at heart. “We are family and I think Alonso violated that trust,” Munoz said. “I am demanding, not asking, for his resignation.” Last to speak was President Maria Valado who agreed with all the comments by other trustees, adding that board members must be held to a higher standard. “As elected officials we are charged with a duty of safeguarding and protecting the minds and bodies of the most vulnerable in our society: our children,” Valado said, calling for Alonso’s resignation. “Step aside. There are others in our community who are so willing and able to stand up and protect our children.” Before voting in favor of the resolution, Valado added that the board is supposed to represent the community and that these comments don’t do that. A righteous ultimatum Rev. Patterson thanked the board for holding the emergency meeting to show that the issue is important, but ultimately questioned the point of such meeting if the board was not going to implement any change. Beginning with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King’s speech on the work that needs to be done in terms of race relations, Rev. Patterson said that we are still dealing with the evils of racism today. Having heard what everyone said, Rev. Patterson made it clear that she and all Black Americans have a right to be angry. “If you allow him to stay on this board, you have now put a knee on the neck of every African American in this city,” Rev. Patterson said. She challenged the board to go beyond what they were told was possible and remove Alonso, doing not just the right thing but also what she said was the righteous thing to do. “I came here today hoping I can leave here and breathe,” Patterson said of the figurative knee being held on her neck by Alonso remaining on the board. Rev. Patterson also urged all board members and other staff present to be front and center at any protests in Bayonne. “If you’re not walking with us, you’re standing somewhere against us,” Rev. Patterson said. “We are #BayonneStrong. But if we are wrong on this, we will be #BayonneWrong forever.” Ethics complaints ahead However, Patterson’s pleas to remove Alonso fell on deaf ears, prompting Woods to return to the podium. Woods began questioning what can be done, as any member of the BTA would be removed under the social media acceptable use policy if they posted anything of the sort. Woods added he would not only walk with protestors if they marched in Bayonne, but would also become an “agitator” at every corner if Alonso doesn’t resign or won’t be removed. “He cannot remain, we must come together and decide what to do to get him removed,” Woods said. Trustee Dennis Wilbeck then interjected, adding that while it’s almost impossible for the board to remove Alonso here, an ethics charge can be brought against him. However, due to COVID-19, the Dept. of Education would probably not be able to review the case until November. In which case, the easier solution may be to have voters speak their minds at the polls also in November, as Alonso is up for re-election this year. Rev. Patterson underscored that something needs to happen now, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Valado, agreed with Rev Patterson, in turn suggesting residents file ethics complaints against Alonso. “Ethics complaints can be filed and everyone in the community should,” Valado said. “One ethics complaint sends a message, 100 complaints send and even louder message.” Breaking into tears, President Valado expressed her daily thoughts about what must be going through her students’ heads, many of whom are African American. At the end of the meeting, Valado vowed to march with any protestors in Bayonne. “When we have a protest, I am with you. We are with you walking, right at the front,” Valado said. “It’s time to end the social injustice in our nation.” Alonso responds Despite his absence from the meeting, Alonso addressed the controversy in a statement to The Bayonne Community News. “My post was about Bayonne’s economic viability; an intellectual discussion on why we won’t have looting since we don’t have any stores,” Alonso said. According to Alonso, people in the city have been complaining for years about no stores to shop in. Alonso also clarified that he only advocates for peaceful protest. “I am an advocate of peaceful protest, but rioting and looting should not be tolerated,” Alonso continued, iterating his support for President Trump. “No one is thinking about keeping our kids safe. They are just thinking about their re-election.” In addition, Alonso outlined his support for a city-wide protest including board members. “We should all protest together, the board; the kids, teachers, parents, the police and the mayor!” Alonso said. Alonso does not plan to resign from the Board of Education, leaving it up to the voters to decide in November.

A Facebook post by Brian Ricks featured screenshots of the comment that had been reported to the township.

Justin Spry, 21, is facing two federal charges of attempting to damage the police vehicle by fire, facing five to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that a street camera recorded Spry and another person trying to stuff cloth into the gas tank of the marked police vehicle and try to light it on fire. Prosecutors said Spry tried to make a run for it after cops caught them in the act. Video posted by Spry on his Twitter account shows him being subdued on the sidewalk by several police officers. He claims he was beaten by the police and makes no mention of trying to set fire to a police car. ""On Sunday I attended a BLM protest in Trenton, NJ which was mostly peaceful until it wasn’t,"" he wrote. ""I was beaten viciously by about 10 state troopers before they wrestled me to the ground and I can say with confidence that if I was black I probably would’ve been killed. This is not okay.""

NorthJersey.com PATERSON – With anger but no violence, more than 500 people protested the police custody death of George Floyd by chanting, kneeling, singing and marching for three hours in the city's downtown on Tuesday night. The rally – which community leaders said was Paterson’s largest in the past decade – began on the steps of the historic city library on Broadway where protesters kneeled for eight minutes in honor of Floyd’s final moments pinned to the ground by police officers in Minneapolis. The throng then marched four blocks to Paterson police headquarters where tensions escalated as protesters pushed against barricades, cursing at cops standing out front. But the hostilities were defused when seven high-ranking police department members – including Chief Ibrahim “Mike” Baycora and Public Safety Director Jerry Speziale – kneeled in response to the crowd’s “Take a Knee” chant. Over 500 people gathered in downtown Paterson on Tuesday, June 2, 2020 to protest the murder of George Floyd. (Photo: Paterson Press) The rally next moved on to City Hall, clogging Market Street, where the group sang, “Lean on Me,” and listened to speeches decrying racism by law enforcement officers against African Americans. During the speeches, a few protesters posed for photos with cops and one man climbed atop a statute in City Hall plaza so that a 19th century political figure ended up holding a “F--- the police” sign. Throughout the event, Paterson police followed what officials said was a “non-adversarial” strategy as the cops assigned to the event mostly stayed in the background. Police officers in marked vehicles blocked cross streets to allow the crowd to march through the downtown district unimpeded by traffic, and even accommodated the protesters when they chose to take a route slightly different from the one set up by authorities. NYC: Peaceful protesters' message: 'Looters have nothing to do with us' Paterson Black Lives Matter leader Zellie Thomas, one of the rally’s organizers, told the crowd that justice won’t be served until authorities prosecute the three Minneapolis police officers who assisted former officer Derek Chauvin as he kneeled on Floyd’s neck. Chauvin has been charged with third degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. “He wasn’t resisting arrest, he was resisting death,” Thomas said. “Just as cops are trying to go home to their families, so are we” Thomas then urged the crowd to kneel for eight minutes to recall Floyd’s ordeal and people went down on one knee on the library steps, on the concrete sidewalk and on the asphalt of the street. When each minute that passed, Thomas led the protesters in a “George Floyd” chant and during the final 60 seconds they repeatedly chanted some of Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe.” About 10 people spoke from the microphone during the protest. Larry Hamm, an activist from Newark, told the crowd about a pending state Supreme Court case that may give civilian review boards in New Jersey unprecedented powers for overseeing the conduct of police. Alexis Miller, a recent Rutgers graduate from Paterson, asserted to the protesters that taxpayers should “divest” from police department funding. “Do you want to keep paying the police?” Miller asked. “No,” the crowd responded resoundingly. “Do you want to pay somebody who will kneel on your neck for eight minutes?” she continued. “No,” the crowded roared even louder. One speaker, Shombay Burton of Paterson, noted the large numbers of white people among the protesters. “I’m glad to see you’re here,” Burton said to them. “When you go back to your communities, speak out against the police terrorism that’s going on in the black community.” At the start of the protest, Paterson activist Bilak Hakeem warned the group against engaging in the violence and looting that has overshadowed the purpose of other rallies around the country. He said organizers wanted the Paterson event to remain peaceful, adding, “We have the street soldiers here to make sure it stays that way.” Indeed, several times during the event, the rally’s informal security staff admonished protesters who threw water bottles towards police officers. At one point, a protester climbed atop the roof of a Paterson police SUV and others in the crowded convince him to get off the vehicle. “We’re not getting off message,” Hakeem told the crowd. “We’re not tearing up where we live at.” Read or Share this story: https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/paterson-press/2020/06/02/500-march-through-downtown-paterson-protest-george-floyds-death/3130308001/",0.0

NorthJersey.com There was moment Tuesday around 6:30 p.m. when there was real concern about Clifton's protest at City Hall that things could have turned ugly when hundreds of attendees spontaneously began marching down Clifton Avenue. In back of many people's minds, there was a real fear that peaceful protest could turn violent as passions have been inflamed following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week and sparked a firestorm of protests and riots throughout the country. Clifton police said beforehand they had prepared for the worst. Extra officers were on hand and entrances to the front of city hall were blocked off by police and public works vehicles. There were even two cops stationed on the roof overlooking the crowd and technically the protest was in violation because no permit was secured. Story continues after gallery As it later turned out, the precautions were needed later in the night when police said there were some who confronted them by throwing rocks and bottles. Late in the evening, there was still reported to be a large crowd in front of Clifton City Hall. Before that happened, hundreds had already left the rally, which the organizers had initially hoped would be limited to city grounds. Paterson: Over 500 march through downtown to protest George Floyd's death NYC: Peaceful protesters' message to America: 'Looters have nothing to do with us' Passaic's Howard Pujols said he witnessed a group started yelling and marching and soon a throng was following them down Clifton Avenue. First Clifton's police and later Passaic's cleared a path for the marchers who chanted ""Hands up. Don't shoot,"" and ""No justice, no peace"" as people lined up on the porches or peered out their apartment windows to watch. Thankfully, the march ended peacefully as the group marched down Clifton Avenue where they turned down Main Avenue where they headed to Passaic's City Hall. Passaic Police Chief Luis Guzman said the whole thing was unplanned. ""We just did what Clifton did,"" he said, which was to let the marchers blow off steam as they marched three-plus miles from Clifton to Passaic. ""I am impressed with these kids,"" the chief said. ""I don't know that I would have the wisdom at that age."" Passaic Mayor Hector Lora said he when he heard of the march, he encouraged police to let them go to Passaic's City Hall. Protest organizer Justin Rivera told the hundreds that gathered around 5 p.m. in front of City Hall the march had to be cancelled. They had no permit to march. He added he was initially concerned when the crowd broke away from the rally. He hesitated before joining them. ""It turned out beautiful,"" Rivera said. ""I am overwhelmed from emotions."" Rivera sent out the message about the protest on Monday and people responded. By 5:15 there were hundreds of people most of them holding signs. People came from all over. Athos Nash drove up with his family from Westfield to participate. ""We are trying to support and join in the the solidarity,"" he said. Things need to change, he said. He has an 18-year-old son and had the talk with him telling him how the realities can be for a person of color. Things like the need to be careful when driving and doubly so if you get pulled over. ""It is a very important conversation,"" he said. The whole point of the rally is to see that attitudes, societal and law enforcement change. Local resident Shen Grant agreed that things need to change. A great grandmother, she has an 18-year-old grandson she worries about. When asked if she any significant change in attitudes over her lifetime she replied ""no."" ""They got to stop holding down black men and black woman,"" Grant said. Story continues after gallery Kristiana Ocasio, a freshman at Clifton High, said she was there because she would like to see change. ""It is a disgrace we have to do this for people of color to have justice,"" she said. While the march dispersed peacefully in Passaic, a crowd later gathered in Clifton and things turned violent for a bit, police said, but didn't provide much detail. Clifton police said they were working on report concerning the later incidents involving the rocks and bottles thrown so they didn't have any firm information to give out.

NorthJersey.com NEW YORK — If you’ve been watching the news lately, then you might believe that all the people protesting police brutality in Atlanta and Cleveland and Reno and New York City aren’t really protesting at all. On television, on Facebook and Twitter, the people we see are mostly skinny young men smashing windows and stealing electronics from Verizon stores. If you’ve only been watching the protests from afar, you probably have never heard from people like Eloise Paterson and her friend Ramona Cordero. So please allow me to make the introduction. You may know Paterson’s brother-in-law David, the former governor of New York. Eloise and Cordero both work as attorneys in Harlem. Paterson’s teenage sons attend Collegiate School and The Calhoun School, and Cordero’s daughter attends The Chapin School, three of the most expensive, most rigorous private high schools in this country. And every time their children leave home, Paterson and Cordero worry a police officer might murder them. “I’m terrified if my son just goes out for a jog,” said Paterson, 54. “I hope people realize that this isn’t about the looting. The looters have nothing to do with us. We are out here because we want our children to be safe.” All day on Tuesday, protesters repeated different versions of this message. They marched all over Manhattan, all day long and into the evening. From police headquarters in Foley Square they marched north to Union Square, up to Park Avenue, Lexington Avenue and all the way to Gracie Mansion on 88th Street, 10 miles of zigs and zags intended to keep thousands of people marching together while leaving the police guessing about where they all might go next. Story continues after gallery The speed of the march, and its convoluted path, also was designed to reduce opportunities for protesters and police officers to face off. For nine hours, the protesters and the police maintained this detente, with no windows broken, nor any bones. “We just want police to see black people as people,” said an organizer who gave his name as Jai. “We don’t want them to see a black person and get triggered into the fear response of fight or flight. We just want them to relax.” Few people were actually relaxed in Manhattan on Tuesday. The main protest march appeared to number about 6,500 people, who occupied a half-mile of pavement as it moved. Other marches occupied other streets and parks downtown. Every so often, protesters screamed expletives at police officers standing sentry behind steel barricades. MAAG: Peaceful protests in New York City marred by looters along Fifth Avenue MAAG: Missing quarantine? It's OK. As the world comes back online, many people miss the quiet When organizers of the march witnessed such interactions, they hustled over and began screaming instructions. “Do not engage! Do not engage!” yelled an organizer with a bullhorn, who refused to give her name. “Keep moving! We are not here to fight!” The converging and diverging marches snarled traffic all over the city. Some drivers minded intensely, and laid on their horns. Others enjoyed the opportunity to participate by accident. Paul Sanchez, an exterminator from Brooklyn, was driving to his next appointment at a town house in the East Village when his red work van became engulfed by the sea of protesters. The delay would make him late, but Sanchez didn’t mind. Instead he rolled down his windows and beeped his horn in time with the protesters’ chants. “This march must have just started. It didn’t show up on Waze,” he said. “I think it’s great. I hope it causes some change. All lives matter.” A few hours later, the march trapped Damien Yates in traffic. After dropping his mother off at her job as a nurse’s aide at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Queens, he was driving to his home in Irvington. Instead of getting angry at the delay, Yates climbed onto the roof of his Chrysler minivan, took off his purple Nike sneakers, and cheered the protesters on. “It’s a tragedy what happened to George Floyd,” said Yates, 38. “Protests are good, but nothing changes. Two weeks later, somebody else gets killed. I just hope this time it’s different.” The sea of protesters flows past Sophra Grill on 3rd Ave.  ⁦@northjersey⁩ pic.twitter.com/iIppjzlL7h — Christopher Maag (@Chris_Maag) June 2, 2020 On Monday night, as looters sacked stores on Fifth Avenue, there was no time for anyone to relax. Looters and onlookers ran, shouted expletives at police, then ran some more. Tuesday’s march was larger, and much more mellow. Even people who yelled angrily at police seemed to calm down quickly. Alex Langue led one of the angriest chants of the day. As the crowd marched east on 14th Street past Union Square, Langue looked police officers in the eye and raised his voice. “How do you spell murderer?” he yelled. “NYPD!” the crowd shouted back. “How do you spell racist?” “NYPD!” called the crowd. As the chant petered out, Langue was asked why he’d come. “George Floyd really was the last straw,” said Langue, 21, a student at New York University. “All we want is to live in peace.” At the southeast corner of Union Square, Langue and hundreds of other protesters stopped before a group of nurses gathered outside a Mount Sinai Hospital facility there. The nurses wore green scrubs and blue surgical masks to guard against COVID-19. Many held up their phones to shoot videos. Others held up their fists. All cheered. The protesters, struck by this show of solidarity, stopped and knelt. The nurses, about 50 in all, knelt, too. Story continues after gallery One of the nurses was Lori Howard. She grew up in Los Angeles, and the last time she marched in a protest was in 1991, after police were videotaped beating Rodney King. Howard said she’s too scared to protest this time — between her age and the prevalence of COVID, she doesn’t think it’s safe. But she was happy to cheer the protesters on. “Every time my brother stepped out of our neighborhood when he was a teenager, he got stopped and harassed” by police in Los Angeles, said Howard, 50, who lives in Brooklyn. “And now I see that same type of police behavior here in New York. So yes, I think it’s absolutely great what these kids are doing.” It wasn’t just kids who marched, of course. Jai, the organizer, declined to give his age, but his mustache and goatee were silver and coated in sweat when he lowered his N95 mask. He kept imploring the younger protesters around him to slow down and keep the massive crowd together, partly for strategic reasons and partly because he was getting tired. “Please! People in the front, you’ve got to slow down. Please!” he said. “If we get separated, the police will cut us off. And we have to give the slower people time to catch up.” Paterson and Cordero seemed content to dawdle along toward the rear. Paterson waved a T-shirt printed with Floyd’s face and the words “Justice for George Floyd.” When people sitting on the sidewalk at 54th Street complimented her on the shirt, Paterson was more than happy to stop for a rest. “I don’t want our message and the looters to get mixed up,” she said. “We have great respect for police officers. Several members of my family are police officers. But the treatment of people of color as second-class citizens has got to stop.” Christopher Maag is a columnist for NorthJersey.com.

And members of the Newark Community Street Team, an entity formed six years ago to de-escalate violence in the city, and other community groups were deployed throughout the crowd to try to isolate those intent on destruction. But in more than a dozen interviews, protesters and city leaders said it was the potent determination of predominantly young African-American members of the Newark community — many of whom have had past run-ins with the police — who stood in the way of widespread destruction. “It was a combination of anarchists and opportunists waiting for a window to be broken so they could go in and grab something,” said Aqeela Sherrills, the director of the 50-person street team. “But I tell you: The community wasn’t having it.” At one point during the march, protesters lit an American flag on fire in the middle of Broad Street as a young man used a bat to strike a window of a Dunkin’ Donuts store, witnesses said. “He hit the window one time and there was like 20 people standing in front of him,” Mr. Sherrills said. As protesters whom he called “provocateurs” moved toward buildings owned by Prudential Financial, the city’s most prominent business anchor, which has maintained a presence in Newark for 145 years, a similar standoff was defused, he said.

Zack James of the Camden County Metro Police Department marches along with demonstrators in Camden, N.J., to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. | April Saul via AP New Jersey announces law enforcement reforms in wake of protests against police brutality New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal on Tuesday announced several initiatives designed to increase trust between police and the communities they serve, including an expansion of the state‘s use-of-force database and a proposed licensing program for law enforcement. The measures, detailed during Gov. Phil Murphy’s daily briefing in Trenton, come as residents in New Jersey and across the country take to the streets to protest police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died while in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer pinned him down with his knee until he stopped breathing. Advertisement “The pain and fatigue felt by many in our black and brown communities is real and it is palpable,” Murphy said. “It is the pain and fatigue of decades, generations — at this point, centuries — of inequality and systemic racism. It is pain that has eroded the ties that bind some of our communities and the men and women whose sworn duty it is to protect them.” As part of restoring those ties, Grewal outlined steps the state will take as part of the “Excellence in Policing” initiative launched late last year to foster increased accountability, transparency and professionalism in law enforcement. One of the steps will be to expand the state’s use-of-force database, adding police departments that don’t yet have access by July 1. By the end of the year, New Jersey will use information from the database to update its use-of-force policies for the first time in two decades to “reflect the values of today,” Grewal said. The state will also launch a pilot program in Paterson, Trenton, Atlantic City and Millville to expand crisis intervention team training, in which law enforcement partners with mental health professionals to more safely respond to crises involving mental health. Plus, New Jersey will establish an incident response team to “serve a vital role in defusing tensions and healing a community after a moment of collective trauma,” Grewal said. The team, which will exist within the Division of Civil Rights, will deploy to areas following major civil rights incidents. Grewal also requested that the Police Training Commission implement a statewide licensing program for all law enforcement. “Just as we license doctors, nurses, lawyers … we must ensure that all officers meet a baseline level of professionalism,” Grewal said, adding that those who don’t meet the standard cannot work in New Jersey. The latest updates on law enforcement reforms come amid protests held across the country since last week’s arrest and subsequent death of Floyd. A bystander’s video of Floyd’s encounter with Minneapolis police officers, which sparked national outrage, showed one of the officers, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck as he repeatedly pleads for air. Floyd eventually becomes motionless and is put onto a gurney by paramedics. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder. Three other officers involved in the incident have been fired, but not charged. “Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go, not only in healing our country’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that affect all Americans,” Grewal said. “To the thousands of New Jerseyans who assembled peacefully this week … we share your anger and we share your commitment to change.” While some cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have seen demonstrations turn violent, with attacks on officers and widespread looting, protests in New Jersey — especially in Newark and Camden Monday night — remained mostly peaceful and without incident. Downtown Trenton saw vandalism, looting and attacks on police Monday, and protests in Asbury Park became chaotic, as well. Overall, 12 people were arrested Monday night, State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan said during Tuesday‘s briefing, but it was not clear whether that total included the arrest of an Asbury Park Press reporter, the charges against whom were later dropped. Nearly two dozen protests are planned across the state on Tuesday. “We respect completely the folks who want to protest peacefully,” Murphy said. “Let’s keep it that way.”",0.0

In a statement Saturday, New Jersey State PBA President Pat Colligan condemned Chauvin and the four officers also at the scene. “The actions that we saw on video are contrary to all our training and does harm to the good reputation of the overwhelming number of brave men and women in law enforcement trying to do their job in an honorable and lawful manner,"" Colligan said. “Nobody in law enforcement can look at that video and justify the actions of those officers.” Our journalism needs your support.

Toms River Police Chief Mitch Little, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley Billhimer and members of their respective agencies joined the group, which chanted ""Say his name — George Floyd,"" ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Hands up — Don't Shoot"" and ""I can't breathe"" as they marched from Kohl's in the Toms River Shopping Center, down Main Street to Washington Street. ""This is not about black or white, it's everyone vs. racism,"" said Katrina Garcia, a Toms River South graduate who was one of the march's organizers. ""The fight for civil rights applies to everyone."" The protest later moved to Route 37, where demonstrators stood along the highway chanting and cheering as passing cars and trucks honked in support. The number in the group ebbed and flowed as temperatures heated up, and at one point, the group along Route 37 kneeled, single fists raised in the air.

(Karen Wall photo) At the courthouse, the group formed lines on either side of the sidewalk leading to the historic portion of the courthouse. There, Jamaal Holmes, a Toms River North graduate who was one of the organizers, thanked Little and Billhimer, before urging everyone in attendance to take a knee. ""It was important for everyone to see law enforcement in Ocean County stands with these demonstrators and supports peaceful protests,"" Billhimer said afterward. ""Standing in solidarity should not be controversial; it's crucial for the future generations,"" Garcia said. ""Change stems from within, which is why even communities that have not experienced police brutality are coming together to stand against it."" Pastor Michael Mazer also addressed the group, offering prayer. ""Your word teaches us that if part of the body burns the whole body burns. Let us feel the pain that the black community has at this moment and let us bring healing not only to the black community, but to the entire community that we will no longer look at people as inferior but rather that we are children of God."" Katrina Garcia (in white shirt) addresses the crowd in front of the Ocean County Courthouse. (Karen Wall photo) The protest was one of dozens around the country and around New Jersey that have arisen in the wake of the death of Floyd, 46, who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck on May 25 after being arrested following a 911 call reporting a counterfeit $20 bill.  Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was seen in multiple videos kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes before he died, was fired and has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other Minneapolis police officers involved in the incident have been fired but no charges have yet been filed against them. Before the protest, Billhimer addressed rumors that swirled on social media about plans for violence in Toms River, saying they have not been substantiated. ""We are expecting a peaceful protest/gathering,"" Billhimer said in a statement issued Monday night. ""We stand in solidarity with those that wish to protest peacefully. We are aware of rumors circulating on social media regarding this protest/gathering and there is no evidence at this time to support those rumors."" Garcia reminded the marchers that they need to set an example for the younger generations, who are watching these events unfold all over the country. ""This march is for us to be heard and seen and to lead by example,"" she said. ""For it to be effective, we must remain focused and safe. To be taken seriously, we must remain peaceful."" Even as the protest moved to Route 37, it was peaceful into the afternoon. Toms River police had a very visible presence for the morning march, and police and members of the Ocean County Sheriff's Department were in the parking lot of the Toms River Shopping Center monitoring the Route 37 group. ""It is our priority to maintain the safety of our entire community while allowing a peaceful demonstration,"" Toms River police said in a statement Monday. ""Over the years we have built an amazing relationship with our community. We stand with you together.""  The rumors have claimed people would be bused in from outside the area to cause damage and engage in violence similar to what has been seen in some cities across the country. Five businesses — four at the Toms River River Shopping Center and one downtown — boarded up windows at their stores. But others operated with seemingly little concern, moving sale items out onto the sidewalk for the day. Have a news tip? Email karen.wall@patch.com Follow Toms River Patch on Facebook. ",0.0

As the night wore on, protesters had heated verbal exchanges with officers outside the police department headquarters. Tensions arose when officers in riot gear, at around 9:30 p.m., began attempting to physically disperse the remaining 200 or so protesters outside the department, in keeping with an 8 p.m. curfew announced earlier in the day by Asbury Park officials. Officers yelled “back up” and “time to go” while approaching protesters who chanted “no justice, no peace.” A smaller group continued walking down Bangs Avenue past the post office as an advancing police line followed. Some demonstrators threw rocks at the police. Several protesters were arrested a police officer was taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune with a head injury. Other officers rushed him from the scene with a bloody head wound. It was not immediately clear how he was injured. A reporter for the Asbury Park Press, Gustavo Martínez Contreras, was arrested while streaming a video on Twitter of police clearing the street, the newspaper reported. NJ Advance Media journalists also witnessed the arrest. While filming the arrest of a protester, an officer approached Martínez Contreras and yelled, “you’re under arrest” and “get your f---ing hands behind your back,"" the video shows. He later tweeted that he was released from custody after being issued a summons. I was arrested during the protest against police brutality in Asbury Park earlier tonight.

A mid-morning march was held in Toms River where police walked alongside residents from a shopping center on Route 37 down to the Ocean County courthouse, chanting “I can’t breathe,” according to video from the scene. Further south along the Jersey Shore, people gathered in Somers Point and marched toward Ocean City over the 9th Street Bridge Tuesday and ended at the public safety building where police officers spoke to the crowd, took a knee with fellow protestors and joined them in a nine-minute moment of silence. “Black lives matter. All lives matter,” said Michelle “Kola” Hunt, a Somers Point resident who was marching across the bridge Tuesday morning. “Right is right and wrong is wrong. It’s time to take a stand, a peaceful stand, which we’re out here doing now. Hopefully, it stays like this.” The marches stem from those who are protesting against the death of Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after an officer, Derek Chauvin, placed a knee on his neck, hampering Floyd’s ability to breath. Chauvin and three other officers from the Minneapolis Police Department were fired, and Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Demonstrations have sprung up across the county, calling for an end to police brutality. The dozens of demonstrations held in New Jersey have for the most part been peaceful, however there have also been looting and other acts of violence and vandalism that occurred in Atlantic City, Trenton and again in Asbury Park on Monday night that have kept police departments and some local businesses on edge. Ocean City Mayor Jay Gillian said in a statement Monday that the police were coordinating with several other agencies and ""preparing for any potential situation.” Windows of some storefronts appeared to be boarded up in Somers Point ahead of the demonstration.

The crowd continued over the causeway and into Ocean City, down West Avenue — more than a 2.5-mile walk. Multiple teachers were seen in the crowd. One carried a sign that said “My black students matter,"" and another’s read “teachers know how much black lives matter.” In Ocean City, the march continued to the front of the police station where laid face-first on the ground saying “I can’t breathe” and “mama” as well as reciting the names of people who were killed by police.

I understand both sides,” said Ty Rolls, an Ocean City police sergeant who is black. His voice cracked with emotion as he spoke. “The problem is it’s a lack of education. We don’t teach the real American history. We don’t teach about the ancestry of black people and black leaders and what they did to get here.

1623821158,2020-06-02 18:07:32,"In N.J., progress is being made in policing. But u2018we still have a long, long way to go.u2019",https://www.nj.com/news/2020/06/in-nj-progress-is-being-made-in-policing-but-we-still-have-a-long-long-way-to-go.html,en,False,"blacks, police, demonstrations and riots",310813,newjersey.statenews.net,http://newjersey.statenews.net/,"Police officers embracing protestors. A police chief leading a march. And in an act of solidarity, both protestors and officers taking a knee. These are the images emanating from protests across New Jersey in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. It’s in stark contrast to the destruction happening in larger cities across America, where looting and burning buildings and police cars have become a nightly routine. But that hardly means New Jersey doesn’t have its own law enforcement issues, officials and experts concede. Community leaders and law enforcement experts say more training and statewide use-of-force standards are needed. They also call for black communities to have a voice in the outcomes of investigations involving police-related deaths. “What happened there is reflective of the entirety of policing, so definitely New Jersey too,” said The Rev. Charles Boyer, a pastor and founder of the civil rights group Salvation and Social Justice, of the death of Floyd. Gov. Phil Murphy, speaking Monday at his daily coronavirus briefing, also acknowledged that much more needs to be done in the Garden State to upend systemic racism. “Racism exists here,” Murphy said. “It has held back generations of black and brown citizens, and still threatens the generations to come — inequalities in economic mobility, health care support, accessible housing and educational opportunities. And on and on and on.” The Force Report, a 2018 NJ Advance Media investigation of police use of force in New Jersey, found that a black person was three times more likely to face use of force than someone who is white. In Millville in South Jersey, black people faced use of force at more than six times the rate of whites. In South Orange, it was nearly 10 times. In Lakewood, it was an astronomical 22 times. Both Boyer and Bruce S. Morgan, the president of the New Brunswick area chapter of the NAACP, commended the state Attorney General’s Office for making improvements in police accountability. All investigations of officer-involved shootings are now handled by the attorney general, which police reform advocates lobbied for for years. “We still have a long, long way to go,” Boyer said. The criminal justice system “has proven to be a massive failure, and the only thing it succeeds at is to be racist,” he said. To change the system, Boyer says, black communities need to have more of a say in the outcomes of investigations involving deaths at the hands of the police. He said there needs to be more accountability when officers fail to turn on their body-worn cameras and officers who use lethal force need to be questioned immediately. “There can no longer be the police coverup system we have in place now,” Boyer said. Protesters shake hands with police after thousands of people assembled and marched in Asbury Park on Monday, June 1, 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd a week ago in Minnesota.Andrew Mills | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Jon Shane, a retired Newark police captain who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said more training on the use of physical force is needed in police departments. He said there also needs to be a standardized use-of-force policy across all departments in New Jersey. The Attorney General’s Office has promulgated standards, he said, but departments adopt their own practices. “The business model itself has been created around a 24-hour, catch-all agency that assumes the responsibility for various services after hours,” Shane said. “Policing has such a wide variety of things to train on that you can spend an enormous amount of time and money on training. It would be so oppressively expensive and costly, you wouldn’t be able to maintain it. So you have to pick what you’re going to train.” Morgan, the NAACP president, agrees more training needs to be done, especially implicit biased training. But he also said it boils down to police simply using the tools they already have. “There’s really no need to re-event the wheel,” he said. “Just do the right thing.” One of the images from the weekend protests garnering attention in New Jersey is that of Camden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki walking alongside protestors in the city of Camden. Wysocki said the culture of his police department is built around community policing. “Community policing for us is not a check-off-the-box,” he said. “It’s in our culture.” In August 2019, the department also introduced a use-of-force policy that’s more restrictive than most in the state. Police are instructed to use their service weapons and force as a “last resort.” Wysocki said cops are also told to intervene if they see a fellow officer doing the wrong thing, and that officers also critique each other when they review body-worn camera footage of interactions with the public. “NFL quarterbacks look at film to get better,” he said. “We do that with our officers with our professional development unit every day.” The protests of police brutality are in response to the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. Law enforcement officials around the country have condemned the officer’s use-of-force against Floyd. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder, but many have called on Minneapolis officials to charge the other three officers on the scene who did not intervene. (Those officers have been fired from the Minneapolis police department, though they have not been charged criminally.) At a press conference on Monday, Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose denounced the actions of all four of the Minneapolis police officers and called Chauvin an “embarrassment to the badge."" “That’s blatant murder,” Ambrose said. “Each and every day, all of us go out and do our job and our people do our job. There may be other cases that we have feelings (about), but this was a handcuffed black man with a knee on his neck. Usually, there’s no reason to use force when someone is handcuffed.” NJ Advance Media reporter Joe Atmonavage contributed to this report. Our journalism needs your support.

USA TODAY Jon Bon Jovi has paused, but he didn't hashtag. That's a good thing, say critics of the music industry-wide movement called “The Show Must Be Paused,” hashtag #thshowmustbepaused, that’s meant to reflect on the events of the past week related to the death of George Floyd and the issue of institutional racism in the United States. It's also known as “Blackout Tuesday.” Bon Jovi, like other participants, posted a blank black screen on his social media platforms on Tuesday. He included #theshowmustbepaused in the lower center of the screen.

(Photo: ROBERTO SCHMIDT, AFP via Getty Images) But Bon Jovi did not include a hashtag #blacklivesmatter, or any other hashtags, in the description or comments and that's a good thing, according to critics who say that doing so ties up the lines of communication of the Black Lives Movement in a time of urgency among national protests. “We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message,” said Black Lives Matter activist Kenidra Woods on Twitter on Tuesday. “We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!!” George Clinton, Queen Latifah, the Bouncing Souls, Gaslight Anthem, Everett Bradley of Bon Jovi, Nicole Atkins, Jarod Clemons, and Patti Scialfa of the E Street Band were Jersey artists who posted blank screens, or message of support, without the hashtag #blacklivesmatter by Tuesday afternoon.

Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records founded the movement as “an initiative created by two Black women in music in observance of the long-standing racism and inequity that exists from the boardroom to the boulevard,” according to the group's mission statement. “We will not continue to conduct business as usual without regard to Black lives.” Yet, many are wary of potential negative effects of the movement, intentional for not. “What I hate about it is that it completely takes the focus off of what you can do and places it on what we apparently shouldn't be doing,” said Graham Alexander, head of Victor Records near Camden. “The biggest negative of this is that at a crucial moment when protesters and Black Lives Matter organizers need the lines of communication that Instagram and Twitter and Facebook affords them, now you have a glut of hashtag #blacklivesmatter posts that are keeping protesters from connecting together.” More: Washington, DC, police chief says more than 300 arrested in protests over George Floyd More: George Floyd protests: Jersey musicians will, and won't, take a pause on Blackout Tuesday More: George Floyd: P-Funk legend George Clinton shows what unity looks like as nation teeters Instead of posting, Alexander says musicians should “get down to the protest.” “Change doesn't happen if you just talk about,” Alexander said. This is not a time to be silent, said Kurt Reil of Highland Park's Grip Weeds, who was upset over the actions of police and federal agencies who released tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters near the White House on Monday, June 1. “When a president orders the military to assault its people, a line has been crossed,” said Reil of the action. “Then, after crossing said line, he goes to church and holds up a Bible for a cynical photo-op, effectively using the church as a partisan political prop. I'm outraged and ashamed at how far we have fallen as a nation, and I won't be silent today.” Organizers have heard.

James Dunkins reached out to him this week on behalf of area clergy. “It was something we were thinking about, it was something they were thinking about,” Fanucci said. The planned route is from City Hall to Seventh Street and then to Landis Avenue, headed west to the former Sears building at Delsea Drive, city officials said. Traffic will be detoured during the march. Speakers are expected to address the participants at City Hall as well as at the end of the march. All city employees are invited to attend. “For over 240 years, we have strived to achieve a more perfect union,” the mayor said. “While we have moved a long way towards this ideal, we still have work to do; we cannot solve our problems in an instant because they did not start in an instant.” “We must all recognize our shortcomings, as uncomfortable as that may be, and do the hard work necessary to overcome them,” he said. “No matter your race, religion, or sexual orientation, we are all Americans, entitled to the same rights and opportunities.” “Together we are stronger, and together we can effect meaningful change to make our community and our country a better place for all,” he said. This will be the second march in Center City this week. Vinelanders Tahira Davis and Mia Arbona organized a march demanding justice for Floyd that traveled down Landis Avenue on Monday and concluded with peaceful gathering in Landis Park. Deborah M.

I am sickened by the video. That day my phone immediately became inundated with messages from Verona officers and supervisors sharing their disgust and outrage. It is unfathomable to me, and my Department, that a police officer sworn to protect and to serve could perform such a brutal act. It is criminal that the officers watching failed to intercede. Yesterday, I joined my fellow Essex County Chiefs and Police Executives as we stood in unity with Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose, Newark Police Chief Darnell Henry, Essex County Prosecutor Theodore Stephens, and Essex County Sheriff Armando Fontoura as they condemned the murder of George Floyd by those Minneapolis officers. In Verona, we are deeply committed to our duty to protect and to serve you, the public. We value our relationship with our community (residents and every person we come in contact with) and continually strive to make Verona a better place. We provide our officers with intense training to ensure that best practices and safest techniques are used and implemented. Verona Police were one the first departments in the West Essex area to equip our officers with Body Worn Cameras. The cameras are activated on every encounter with any member of the public. Officers receive Use of Force training twice a year in addition to advanced supplemental courses. All Use of Force incidents are documented and reviewed by supervisory staff and submitted to the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office Professional Standards Bureau. Deviations from the Attorney General Guidelines, including failure to intercede when an officer is seen violating the Guidelines, result in disciplinary actions and/or criminal charges against the offending officers. The death of George Floyd was appalling, unnecessary, inhumane, tragic and unacceptable. We want to see justice for George Floyd. We support those who seek to make their voices heard through peaceful protest. The actions of all of the officers involved are contrary to the values of the Verona Police Department and hurt all officers because they erode public trust. We know that public trust is earned and we will continue to work hard every day to earn your trust. I ask everyone to remember the words of President Kennedy from June 11 1963, “I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.” Christopher Kiernan Chief of Police",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

In a video apparently recorded in a police transport vehicle while still at the Merle Hay Mall and then posted on Twitter, Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. KCCI earlier showed Sahouri sitting on a curb with her hands zip tied behind her back.

The dozens of rallies, especially in the state's largest cities, have the potential to be ""super spreader events"" where young asymptomatic demonstrators could transmit the virus to dozens of other attendees. ""This is absolutely the perfect storm for creating a cluster if not a second wave,"" said Mark Cameron, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""We're not talking the fall. We're talking right now."" The rallies come as Gov. Phil Murphy is touting how well New Jersey has reduced the risk of transmission through more than two months of strict social distancing and the shutdown of most businesses, schools and activities. But Murphy said this week that he has no intention of stopping the rallies on public health grounds — even though they defy his order to limit outdoor gatherings to no more than 25. ""Given the gravity of the killing and the stain of racism in this country, we have to acknowledge there is a desire and there is a right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said at his daily COVID-19 briefing Tuesday. ""I would ask [demonstrators] to please wear masks and keep social distancing."" NJ REOPENING: These are the NJ businesses and services that can reopen in the coming weeks 'We come in peace!': Hundreds flood Jersey City, where cops, protesters march together But while many demonstrators do cover their faces and protest organizers hand out masks, some participants remove their masks or don't wear any. And trying to maintain space has been difficult at some of the larger rallies, which began Saturday following the death of Floyd after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the African American man's neck for at least eight minutes. ""It's certainly possible that they can become what we call super spreader events,"" said Stephanie Silvera, a professor of public health at Montclair State University. ""What concerns me is that the rallies represent communities that have already been disproportionately hit by this virus,"" Silvera said. ""The people most hurt by this pandemic will continue to be hurt."" Of New Jerseyans who have died from COVID-19, almost 19% are black, while blacks make up 15% of the state's population. New COVID cases have dropped significantly over the past 45 days from 4,391 reported on April 15 to 708 on June 1. New Jersey has not seen a significant spike even though several rallies have been held to reopen New Jersey businesses. But those were minuscule compared to the George Floyd rallies that have attracted thousands in the state's biggest cities, including Newark, Jersey City and Camden, and have brought together groups in smaller communities, such as Englewood, Long Branch and Freehold. Most New Jersey rallies have been peaceful compared with places like Philadelphia and New York, where demonstrations have devolved into clashes with police and looting of stores. Murphy said there were at least 21 rallies scheduled statewide on Tuesday. Story continues after photo gallery The fact that the rallies are outdoors automatically helps curb transmission compared with something like an indoor business convention or church choir, where the virus was shown to spread like wildfire before the shutdowns. But protesters are also constantly yelling, chanting and cheering, which expels more droplets into the air and with greater force. ""Even if it's outside, you run the risk of transmitting the virus if you can't maintain the proper distance and wear a mask,"" said Anna Yeung-Cheung, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Manhattanville College in New York. ""You may see cases increase, but will we be going back to 700 dying a day like we saw at the height in New York? I don't think so."" Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

It showed that on March 30, one infected New Jerseyan was likely to infect five other people. After Murphy's stay-at-home order was issued, that rate plummeted to 1.04 by April 14 — the peak of COVID-19 hospitalization. It now stands at less than a person, at 0.88, as of May 30.

Health officials want the rate below one. (Photo: New Jersey Department of Health) But contracting the virus is still very much a threat at outdoor activities so much so that Murphy and health officials have agonized over when and how to allow graduation ceremonies or limiting al-dresco dining. The time from exposure to COVID-19 to onset of symptoms is three to 14 days. But the real risk may not be to the protesters themselves, the vast majority of whom are young and are more likely to be asymptomatic or to develop minor symptoms. The risk is to older people with whom demonstrators come in contact. ""It's when they go home to visit their parents when the real risk occurs,"" Cameron said. ""Between the crowds you saw on Memorial Day weekend and now the rallies, you have a one-two punch that could really set this country back,"" Cameron said.

""This is absolutely the perfect storm for creating a cluster if not a second wave,"" said Mark Cameron, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""We're not talking the fall. We're talking right now."" The rallies come as Gov. Phil Murphy is touting how well New Jersey has reduced the risk of transmission through more than two months of strict social distancing and the shutdown of most businesses, schools and activities. But Murphy said this week that he has no intention of stopping the rallies on public health grounds — even though they defy his order to limit outdoor gatherings to no more than 25. ""Given the gravity of the killing and the stain of racism in this country, we have to acknowledge there is a desire and there is a right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said at his daily COVID-19 briefing Tuesday. ""I would ask [demonstrators] to please wear masks and keep social distancing."" NJ REOPENING: These are the NJ businesses and services that can reopen in the coming weeks 'We come in peace!': Hundreds flood Jersey City, where cops, protesters march together But while many demonstrators do cover their faces and protest organizers hand out masks, some participants remove their masks or don't wear any. And trying to maintain space has been difficult at some of the larger rallies, which began Saturday following the death of Floyd after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the African American man's neck for at least eight minutes. ""It's certainly possible that they can become what we call super spreader events,"" said Stephanie Silvera, a professor of public health at Montclair State University. ""What concerns me is that the rallies represent communities that have already been disproportionately hit by this virus,"" Silvera said. ""The people most hurt by this pandemic will continue to be hurt."" Of New Jerseyans who have died from COVID-19, almost 19% are black, while blacks make up 15% of the state's population. New COVID cases have dropped significantly over the past 45 days from 4,391 reported on April 15 to 708 on June 1. New Jersey has not seen a significant spike even though several rallies have been held to reopen New Jersey businesses. But those were minuscule compared to the George Floyd rallies that have attracted thousands in the state's biggest cities, including Newark, Jersey City and Camden, and have brought together groups in smaller communities, such as Englewood, Long Branch and Freehold. Most New Jersey rallies have been peaceful compared with places like Philadelphia and New York, where demonstrations have devolved into clashes with police and looting of stores. Murphy said there were at least 21 rallies scheduled statewide on Tuesday. Story continues after photo gallery The fact that the rallies are outdoors automatically helps curb transmission compared with something like an indoor business convention or church choir, where the virus was shown to spread like wildfire before the shutdowns. But protesters are also constantly yelling, chanting and cheering, which expels more droplets into the air and with greater force. ""Even if it's outside, you run the risk of transmitting the virus if you can't maintain the proper distance and wear a mask,"" said Anna Yeung-Cheung, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Manhattanville College in New York. ""You may see cases increase, but will we be going back to 700 dying a day like we saw at the height in New York? I don't think so."" Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

It showed that on March 30, one infected New Jerseyan was likely to infect five other people. After Murphy's stay-at-home order was issued, that rate plummeted to 1.04 by April 14 — the peak of COVID-19 hospitalization. It now stands at less than a person, at 0.88, as of May 30.

Health officials want the rate below one. (Photo: New Jersey Department of Health) But contracting the virus is still very much a threat at outdoor activities so much so that Murphy and health officials have agonized over when and how to allow graduation ceremonies or limiting al-dresco dining. The time from exposure to COVID-19 to onset of symptoms is three to 14 days. But the real risk may not be to the protesters themselves, the vast majority of whom are young and are more likely to be asymptomatic or to develop minor symptoms. The risk is to older people with whom demonstrators come in contact. ""It's when they go home to visit their parents when the real risk occurs,"" Cameron said. ""Between the crowds you saw on Memorial Day weekend and now the rallies, you have a one-two punch that could really set this country back,"" Cameron said. ""You have a lot of progress that can be wiped away."" Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

Derek Chauvin, the former officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder, though Floyd's family is pushing for first-degree murder charges. Three other officers involved with the incident, however, haven't been charged, prompting continued calls across the country against police brutality. Daily protests have frequently been marred by violence and looting, and police have frequently used tear gas, chemical irritants and rubber bullets in efforts to quell protesters — sometimes even when protests remain peaceful. Journalists have also been caught in clashes between protesters and police. Tuesday also saw a nationwide movement called ""Blackout Tuesday."" Here's a look at city-by-city protests on Tuesday night: Miami: Young, racially diverse crowd marches in historically black neighborhood An afternoon crowd of 100 grew to about 400 by evening as it weaved past through the city's historically black neighborhood Overtown and into its gentrified Wynwood arts area with minimal police presence. The young, racially diverse crowd repeated chants of “black lives matter” and “say his name: George Floyd” as they marched through about five miles of streets surrounded by organizers who halted traffic around them and tailed by a handful of police officers on bicycles. At the insistence of organizers, the group dispersed by 8 p.m., an hour before the city's curfew began. 'Reprehensible':Washington archbishop denounces Trump visit to Catholic shrine as 'baffling' Tuesday’s march was organized by Dream Defenders, a grassroots group of young activists that believes in the abolition of prisons, policing, surveillance and punishment. Days of protests across the city inspired 18-year-old Miami resident Ashley Pierre. The high school senior said she was tired of sharing social media posts calling for change, ""we need to make it change."" While protesters chanted in support of inmates at the detention center, about a dozen officers stood silently behind police tape between the jail and the Richard E. Gerstein Justice Building. Not everyone reveled in the tone of non-violence emphasized during Tuesday’s rally. Rene Charles, a 25-year-old native of Little Haiti, sees violence as a simple and effective tool to protect the community against police brutality. “Bad people who use violence can and will only be stopped by good people who are better at violence,” he said. “This isn’t a game; there are people’s lives at stake.” The impassioned cries reached 13-year-old Bianca Hanks' family home in Overtown. When she heard the chants, she grabbed a ""Black Lives Matter"" poster and ran outside. ""It's a really great feeling,"" the seventh grader said. – Olivia Hitchcock and Matt Bruce, Palm Beach Post Madison, Wisconsin: Muralists look to beautify city after days of protests As the sky darkened and a storm rolled toward Madison, protesters still gathered on the lawn of the Capitol building with cases of water and signs. In front of the iconic ""Forward"" statue, which appeared to have been painted brown after being doused in red paint on Monday night, a woman spoke to the crowd, warning them about being peaceful and not staying out too late. ""After 1 a.m., we can't help you,"" she said. Down from the Capitol, more protesters funneled into the center of the city, past boarded up windows and spray paint. But a group of muralists from worked to beautify the otherwise stark scene. Colorful murals, bearing words phrases like ""Stronger together"" and ""Create the world you want to live in,"" were being painted over the plywood. – Laura Schulte, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Detroit: Police arrest protesters who defy curfew: ‘We can’t afford’ violence Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters he didn’t want to make any arrests on the fifth night of protests across the city in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. ""Our goal is not to arrest,"" Craig said. But, he added, ""We can't afford to have what we've seen in other places."" However, after a group of people splintered off from a gathering that began near the downtown Detroit Police Department headquarters and defied a citywide curfew, police enforced the law. After continuing to ask protesters to remove themselves from the road, Detroit police boxed them in from all sides and began making arrests about an hour after the citywide curfew. Officers used zip ties to detain protesters and put water in the eyes of those hit by pepper spray. They lined up the arrested, while seated, on the sidewalk. Previous protests began peacefully but quickly turned violent after dark, sparking Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to implement a curfew for the city from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., indefinitely. – Evan Petzold, Angie Jackson, Kristen Jordan Shamus, M.L. Elrick, Branden Hunter, Mark Kurlyandchik and Darcie Moran, Detroit Free Press Chicago: Protesters take to the streets: 'I’m tired of seeing our people killed' As separate marchers began across the city, thousands of young people from various Chicago neighborhoods marched south from Wrigley Field, chanting “hands up don’t shoot” and “say his name! George Floyd! say her name! Breonna Taylor!” Volunteers along the way handed out snacks and water amid the 90-degree heat. CPD officers on bikes guided the protest south. West Siders Angel Griffin, 25, and Tatyiana Mack, 26, say they were there to march peacefully and bring attention to police brutality. “There have been so many personal experiences I’ve had that have never hit the news. I want people to know. I want them to care,” Mack said. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Over the course of nearly four hours in 90-degree heat, the group marched south to Lincoln Park and then west to the 18th district police station, where dozens of officers lined either side of the street. Tensions rose as protesters formed lines opposite the officers, chanting “who do you protect? who do you serve?” The marchers eventually took a knee outside the station, and organizers and protesters took turns speaking to the crowd, singing and sharing stories of their experiences of police brutality. Marching amidst the crowd, Tasha Quinn, 33, said she normally doesn’t protest but said she could no longer stay at home. Carrying a sign reading “Stop Killing Our Black Men,” Quinn said she was born near where George Floyd died in Minneapolis, and now lives in Chicago. “I’m tired. I’m tired of seeing our people killed,” said Quinn as the group streamed past a closed Mariano’s supermarket people tried to loot Monday night. “I’m just at my limit.” Quinn said she and her friends deliberately chose comfy clothes that they didn’t care about, and sensible shoes they could run in, just in case violence broke out during or immediately after Tuesday’s march. Chicago remains under a curfew beginning at 8 p.m. and Quinn said the possibility of violence in her community is always a concern- both from criminals and from police officers treating innocent people unfairly. ”That’s why we’re doing this,” she said, gesturing at the marchers. “Because we aren’t safe, because we aren’t protected.” Chicago police on Monday made 396 arrests, including 146 for looting, according to a spokesperson. – Grace Hauck and Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Las Vegas: Black Lives Matter march ends peacefully after Monday shootings About 200 protesters gathered in Las Vegas to march in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. There was a noticeable police presence as the marchers made their way peacefully from a bar and nightclub near the UNLV campus to University Center Drive, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice, no peace."" The Nevada National Guard had been called to assist Las Vegas police, one night after a peaceful protest turned violent and a police officer was shot and another man was killed by police. – Sam Gross and Brett McGinness, Reno Gazette Journal, and Terell Wilkins, The Spectrum (St. George, Utah) Phoenix: Thousands of protesters take to streets as 'Churches Stand Together' More than 1,000 people met outside Phoenix City Hall and began marching through downtown Phoenix by 5:30 p.m. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, maybe more than 1,000, gathered outside Neighborhood Ministries near 19th Avenue and Van Buren Street. They planned to begin walking the half-mile to Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza outside the Arizona Capitol and hold a prayer service. The protest at the Capitol was organized by ""Arizona Churches Stand Together for Black Lives,"" which created an event page that showed more than 600 planning to attend and 1,000 more interested. 100 ways:Take action against racism right now The group was ""organically"" formed in the past 24 hours with three Phoenix churches at the helm — Roosevelt Community Church, Redemption Church Alhambra and All Souls Phoenix — according to Dennae Pierre. The churches' congregations are multiethnic, many from black and Latino communities, she said. ""Our hearts are broken over the continued violence against black lives,"" said Pierre, whose husband, Vermon, is a pastor at Roosevelt Community Church. ""Year after year, we have these stories that surface and, you know, what does it look like to not just be sorry about it and sad until the news dies down, but to really commit to a life of change and being part of rebuilding what needs to be built?"" – Chelsea Curtis, Arizona Republic Louisville, Kentucky: Protesters turn out at David McAtee candlelight vigil Protesters returned to the streets in downtown Louisville following the fatal shooting of David McAtee and five days of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. A few hundred people gathered outside Metro Hall at 5 p.m., just a few hours after Louisville Metro Police released additional video footage they say shows McAtee shooting a gun before law enforcement officials returned fire. Other groups have popped up around town, including another gathering at Dino's Food Mart, where McAtee was killed. A candlelight vigil began at around 9:30 p.m. by Dino's Food Mart. A crowd had been at the scene all evening, according to Courier Journal reporters Phillip M. Bailey and Johnathan Bullington, honoring the life of the local barbecue shop owner. Those in attendance lit up candles to remember the 53-year-old McAtee while his nephew, Marvin McAtee, served barbecue to those in attendance. Louisville's curfew went into effect more than a half-hour earlier at 9 p.m. – Lucas Aulbach, Ben Tobin and Emma Austin, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.) Minneapolis: 'Silent clergy march' stretches for two blocks, stops traffic The Rev. Stacey Smith organized a pair of marches in the Twin Cities on Tuesday, but even she was surprised at the large turnout. “God bless you all. This is much bigger than I thought that it would be,” Smith told a gathering of about 300 people shortly before they set out for a seven-block walk down 38th Street in south Minneapolis. The destination was Cup Foods, where George Floyd died on Memorial Day while handcuffed in police custody. Smith, a leader in the African Methodist Episcopal church here, told the faith leaders ready to walk with her: “We are here for justice and peace today.” 'Word of God as a political prop':GOP senators criticize Trump after George Floyd protesters forced out of park Black clergy members led the way, followed by white ministers “as a symbolic show that you’ve got our backs in this,” Smith said to loud applause. It was billed as a “silent clergy march” and the group quietly proceeded down the middle of the street, stretching for two blocks while traffic stopped. One man on a bicycle watched and broke the silence by raising his hands over his hands and clapping. – Mark Emmert, Des Moines Register Los Angeles: Protesters remain peaceful: 'It's time for change' In downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of protesters remained peaceful while at times kneeling en masse against police brutality and at others calling for the resignation of a Los Angeles Police Department chief who had blamed looters for George Floyd’s death. Roughly two dozen police officers in riot helmets and a handful of California National Guardsmen stood under ornate columns and guarded the art deco-styled City Hall from protesters who made no effort to breach metal barricades or police tape. LAPD:Chief Michel Moore apologizes after saying George Floyd's death is on the 'hands' of looters Some of the protesters waved signs calling for the firing of Police Chief Michel Moore, who on Monday had lashed out at Los Angeles looters by declaring: “His death is on their hands, as much as it is on those officers.” At around 1 p.m., the protesters left City Hall to snake, chanting, through downtown. Guardsmen armed with semi-automatic rifles stood in front of businesses that were vastly shuttered or boarded up due to a combination of the novel coronavirus and nights of looting that have brought comparisons to the city’s riots following the Rodney King beating in 1992. 6 Atlanta officers charged:Dramatic video showed police pulling people from car But Tuesday afternoon, with the downtown air pungent with sage and marijuana, the protesters seemed to be in a constructive mood. Some distributed face masks. Others, veggie quesadillas. Chinatown resident Brandon Anaya and two friends handed out bottles of water, granola bars and bananas. Anaya, who wore a Mexican flag bandana over his mouth and nose, was born the year of the L.A. riots. He said he had to convince his father Francisco, who had lived through them, that participating in this protest was a good idea. “He said it’s time for change, to do it right, and to do it properly and peacefully, and I think that’s what we’re seeing today,” said Anaya. “We’re Hispanic, and the police treat us the same way they treat black people.” Protesters kneeled in front of the officers and yelled for them to join them, but the cops didn’t budge. An irate protester pointed at them and let loose a stream of profanities. It was the sort of tense situation that Americans have watched boil over into violence many times over the last week. – Gus Garcia-Roberts, USA TODAY Memphis, Tennessee: Protesters wrap up seventh night of demonstrations A march of about 350 protesters made its way through downtown Memphis, marking the seventh night in a row the city's residents took to the streets in protest. By the time the city's 10 p.m. curfew hit, the crowds citywide had largely dispersed. Other, smaller protests took place in the area. A protest consisting of about 20 young adults holding up signs (""For George Floyd,"" ""Let Freedom Ring"") earned approving honks from passing motorists. Abraham Nakayama, 19, said the event was organized ""on the spur of the moment"" to reach people who likely wouldn't see the much-publicized downtown protests. ""I've been marching the past four days, and you're pretty much reaching the same people,"" he said. To date, protests in Memphis have not produced widespread property damage or spontaneous infernos at government buildings, but they haven't been void of tension either. – Micaela A Watts, Max Garland, Katherine Burgess and John Beifuss, The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tenn.) Augusta, Georgia: Pop-up protest against racial injustice draws 100 people Though they only had a few hours to set it up, Alasya Owten and Francesca Collette-Hicks were determined to have a march against racial injustice. ""I actually called the sheriff to try to get a permit, but they actually told me it was pretty late,"" Owten said. ""I got in contact with the lieutenant of the sheriff department and he actually just sent me a confirmation email saying that we'll be protected and safe out here."" With that support and the power of social media, they brought out over 100 supporters to a peaceful protest in the heart of downtown Augusta. The march started at 7:30 and ended at a local confederate monument. ""What makes me so happy right now is when I look out across this plaza, and we shadow a statue that tells us we aren't worth anything, we look out and see people of all races, all colors, all backgrounds, all social economics, are saying that we do matter and that our voices will be heard,"" Johnson said. This was the fifth event in the Augusta-area held in response to the death of Floyd. All five have been peaceful. –Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Indianapolis: Demonstrations continue on third night of citywide curfew Demonstrators gathered in downtown Indianapolis for the fifth straight day to protest recent police-involved killings of black people, including George Floyd and Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis. The city is on its third night of curfew, which began at 9 p.m. and ends at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Just before 8:30 p.m., a crowd of roughly 200 demonstrators started moving south on Meridian Street from Monument Circle and toward the City-County Building. A group of protesters was seen debating whether to stay or go home once curfew goes into effect. One protester warned that those who stay past curfew ""will be engaged by the police."" – Matthew VanTryon, Indianapolis Star Washington, D.C: Protesters remain past curfew near White House The large crowd protesting near the White House past the 7 p.m. curfew continued to chant and demonstrate against police brutality. Some, calling for a peaceful protest, booed a man who tore down a street sign in the area. People also threw bottles at him as he climbed down from the street signpost. Residents in a northwest neighborhood of the city, far from the main protests, leaned out their apartment windows, banging together frying pans and other noisemakers. The clanging stopped after several minutes. Helicopters could then be heard circling in the distance. Meanwhile, the vast majority of protesters remained outside the White House. – Joey Garrison, John Fritze, Michelle R. Martinelli and Matthew Brown, USA TODAY Milwaukee: At least 2 protesters arrested after clashes with police Police released a statement saying protesters were throwing rocks and glass at officers, resulting in at least two arrests after a dramatic standoff just west of the Milwaukee River. After police fired several tear gas canisters and rubber bullets at protesters, the crowd had largely dispersed as of 8 p.m. – Bill Glauber, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Brockton, Massachusetts: Fireworks thrown at police, tear gas deployed Tensions escalated, resulting in police deploying tear gas and flash-bang grenades at protesters who threw fireworks and other objects at them. Following a protest and peace rally at West Middle School, which remained peaceful, hundreds of protesters at various points split off and began walking eastbound toward downtown. Hundreds of protesters first gathered outside Brockton City Hall in the amphitheater, where several impromptu speeches took place. Protesters then walked to the nearby Brockton Police Department, where they have remained for hours. – Cody Shepard, The Enterprise",0.0

In Jersey City, protesters marched through the streets and met officers in riot gear at a precinct. “We’re not looking to be combative with the police. We’re looking to engage the community,” said Nevin Perkins, president of Black Men United. Essex County law enforcers stood with Newark’s mayor Monday in condemning the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “What we all witnessed in Minneapolis was tragic beyond words and truly demoralizing to the righteous, hard-working men and women of our profession,” said South Orange Police Department Chief Kyle Kroll. In Camden, county police marched with demonstrators in a city former President Obama commended for getting policing right. “Sometimes when there’s a radical situation, there has to be radical change,” said Wasim Muhammad, president of the Camden Schoo Board and minister at Muhammad’s Temple No. 20. “And standing up with the new police force allowed Camden to be ahead of what we see going on with police relationships in most urban communities. Camden got ahead of it eight years ago, and what you see if the effect of the trust that some people have in Camden with the police force.” In an open letter, Obama wrote “the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels. Voter turnout in these local races is usually pitifully low, especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues.” And Rutgers-Camden Law Dean Kim Mutcherson says the treatment of Floyd and officers knowing they were being recorded provide energy in this moment to inspire change. “I think that shows you how deep the rot is, right? The idea that you can know that someone is filming you while you perpetrate enormous violence on a man who’s handcuffed and face down on the group says this is a person that has no respect for the man who’s neck his knee is on. That’s obvious, but it also says ‘I’m not scared of being accountable for this,'” Mutcherson said. It was another violent night across the country. Across the river in New York, vandals targeted Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square. An officer pounded a looter in SOHO. In the Bronx, a car plowed into a police sergeant and attackers pounced on and beat up an officer.

Phil Murphy addressed New Jersey's efforts by law enforcement at collaboration and trust-building with the public while also unveiling a new data point to bolster his decision to move the state farther along its path toward restarting its stalled economy in the wake of COVID-19. Murphy used his daily media briefing on the state's response to the virus to update and emphasize initiatives aimed at ""transforming policing and police culture"" in New Jersey ""through collaboration with our diverse communities."" The Governor's comments come at time when cities across the country are being challenged to accommodate peaceful protests following the death of George Floyd while maintaining order as those peaceful protests turned violent once the sun went down. Our newsletter delivers the local news that you can trust. New Jersey has mostly escaped the scenes of chaos and violence that have been playing out daily across the country, although there were clashes with police and arrests made in Atlantic City, Trenton and Asbury Park over last few days. However, the Governor also noted the many peaceful protests that have been held in cities like Newark and Camden and acknowledged the public's right to voice its opinions. More than 20 protests were scheduled to take place today across the state. Noting a collective outpouring of grief, the Governor addressed ""the pain and fatigue of decades, generations and centuries of inequalities and systemic racism."" ""It is pain that has eroded some ties that bind our communities and the men and women whose sworn duty it is to protect them,"" Murphy said. ""While the heart of the issue is not limited to problems in policing I have asked the Attorney General to outline the expanded efforts taken across the state to build upon their existing work to build trust and strengthen the bonds between law enforcement and the communities in which they serve."" Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, who joined the Governor on the dais, said Floyd's death is a reminder that the nation still has a long way to go to healing racial divides and addressing the systemic and implicit biases that affect all Americans.   ""To the thousands of New Jerseyans who assembled peacefully this week, let me be clear: we hear you, we see you, we respect you,"" Grewal said. Grewal said he has been helming efforts to improve policing throughout the state even before this most recent crisis. In December, the state launched the ""Excellence in Policing"" initiative, which he said was a set of reforms designed to promote a culture of professionalism, accountability and transparency for all police departments throughout the state. He provided several updates and additional facets of the new initiative, including launching a pilot crisis intervention training program in Paterson, Trenton, Atlantic City and Millville. He said it is a collaborative training between law enforcement, mental health professionals and other stakeholders to provide best practices on how to respond to psychiatric crises in a way the minimizes the potential for injury. He also said he was fully supportive of and will push for a statewide police licensing program to ""ensure that all officers meet baseline standards of professionalism and those who cannot meet those standards cannot work in New Jersey."" Other new steps Grewal said are being taken include expanding the state's ""Use of Force"" database to allow for all local police departments to report and to update the state's ""Use of Force"" policy that was last updated in 2000. Yesterday, Murphy announced that New Jersey was prepared to enter a new stage in his ""Restart and Recovery"" plan. Phase 2 of his multi-stage plan will begin later this month on June 15 when restaurants can offer outdoor dining, non-essential retail stores can allow customers inside at a reduced capacity. Non-contact youth sports can begin on June 22, as well as the reopening of hair salons and barbershops. In addition to the traditional statistics given to show how the virus is presently waning in the state, the governor showed a new statistic that charts the ability of the virus to reproduce. At its height in mid-March, every infected person was infecting an average of five people. Social distancing measures and wearing of face coverings have today dropped that average to less than one. ""This shows that these measures have worked and will continue to work,"" Murphy said. The governor reported 51 new COVID-19 related fatalities for a total of 11,770 statewide and 708 new COVID-19 cases bringing the statewide total to 161,545. Other key metrics like new hospitalizations, cases in the ICU/CCU and number of patients needing ventilators all continue to trend downward.",0.0

Justin Spry, 21, is facing two federal charges of attempting to damage the police vehicle by fire, facing five to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that a street camera recorded Spry and another person trying to stuff cloth into the gas tank of the marked police vehicle and try to light it on fire. Prosecutors said Spry tried to make a run for it after cops caught them in the act. Video posted by Spry on his Twitter account shows him being subdued on the sidewalk by several police officers. He claims he was beaten by the police and makes no mention of trying to set fire to a police car. ""On Sunday I attended a BLM protest in Trenton, NJ which was mostly peaceful until it wasn’t,"" he wrote. ""I was beaten viciously by about 10 state troopers before they wrestled me to the ground and I can say with confidence that if I was black I probably would’ve been killed. This is not okay."" Days earlier, he posted: ""Can we start these riots everywhere? I’m down to use all of my privilege for anti racism smoke"" The demonstration, one of many across New Jersey and the nation this weekend sparked by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill, began peacefully. Later on, however, several people on East State Street smashed shop windows and attacked police vehicles. Officials said two police cars were set on fire. Trenton Police Director Sheilah Coley on Sunday night apologized for the ""shameful, the disrespectful way that the city where I am employed has decided to honor Floyd's memory."" Spry, who is white, did not immediately respond to New Jersey 101.5's request for comment on the charges against him. On Twitter after his arrest, Spry said that he was ""held in custody for 17 hours with no food or water until the last hour of being held."" New Jersey U.S. Attorney Carpenito said his office ""will not hesitate to bring to justice anyone who engages in this kind of destruction.

Thank you, Toms River for hosting a positive and meaningful march Tuesday. To the organizers, participants, and law enforcement, you made Ocean County & Toms River proud and we should see more events like the ones from Toms River on TV, showing a positive approach to a very worthwhile cause. Following the horrible death of George Floyd and the nights of unrest in other portions of the country, yesterday saw a day of speakers, prayer, and a look to the future to stop crimes like the George Floyd case from happening again. Hats off to the Toms River Police, Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, Ocean County Sheriffs Department and other Law Enforcement for not only keeping the peace, but for participating and being a part of the ""solution"". We must see community and law enforcement come together to stop future injustice and yesterday that was at the forefront in Toms River. Area businesses cooperated during the march. Some did decide to take precautions by boarding up their windows and frankly, you can't blame them. These local businesses have already been ravaged economically from COVID-19 and they did not need any senseless damage that could have possibly occurred. They were simply reacting to what they have seen every night on TV. These businesses are their life and their family's lives....so being cautious didn't interfere with the march and it gave them peace of mind, which is totally their right. I think if we saw more gatherings like the one in Toms River, fewer business people would be intimidated by these types of events. You may have been marching next to local business people, who took part as well. All in all, the community took time yesterday to remember and honor George Floyd and hopefully strengthened bonds between law enforcement and citizens. Let's celebrate yesterday's event and use it to move forward for change and equality and maybe today hug your neighbor (wait can we do that yet?) and spread peace to EVERYONE. Thanks to Vin Ebenau and 92.7 WOBM News for coverage of the event. That's my ""open"" thank you note. Let me know what YOU at home think. Post your comments below ~ Shawn Michaels",0.0

Justo un momento antes había grabado con mi teléfono celular cómo varios agentes habían tacleado violentamente y luego arrestado a dos menores de edad que se retiraban ante el avance de los policías. Siguiendo las órdenes policiales, comencé a retirarme. El video — que estaba transmitiendo en vivo para la audiencia de APP.com en la plataforma Periscope de Twitter — se corta justo cuando me taclean, aunque quise seguir grabando. Otro agente participando en el arresto me asestó un golpe en la mano que me hizo tirar el teléfono. Al hacer esto dijo, “tira su jodi-- teléfono”. El oficial que me arrestó dijo, ""no te resistas"". Yo respondí, ""No me estoy resistiendo. Soy reportero"". Cory Booker: APP journalist arrest 'unacceptable' CLOSE APP reporter Gustavo Martinez's Periscope of the streets being cleared during the protest in Asbury Park shows him being arrested. Asbury Park Press Pronto me entregaron a otro oficial que preguntó qué hacer conmigo y le dijeron que me llevara a una camioneta en la que estaban cargando otros detenidos. Me preguntó qué era lo que colgaba de mi cuello y le dije que era mi gafete de prensa y que era reportero del Asbury Park Press. Me pidió que no le diera problemas y dijo que se portaría ""bien"" conmigo. Estuve tranquilo en todo momento. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. Me quitaron casco, gafas y mochila antes de subirme a la camioneta. Mi credencial de prensa aún colgaba de mi cuello cuando llegamos al cuartel central del Departamento de Policía de Belmar, que estaba ayudando a procesar a algunas de las personas arrestadas en la protesta. Me transportaron con otros cuatro prisioneros, incluidos los dos jóvenes que se ven en el video cuando fueron planchados contra el suelo y arrestados. Editorial: Reporters must not be charged or detained as they cover demonstrations Me conmocionó tanto la brutalidad que acababa de presenciar que realmente no pensé mucho sobre mi arresto, solo hasta más tarde. Me preocupaba más por lo que le había pasado a esos dos chicos. Estaba en la escena para cubrir las protestas provocadas por la muerte sin sentido de George Floyd a manos de la policía de Minneapolis, en un doloroso caso más de brutalidad policial. Mi deber era cubrir el final de una protesta que se había desarrollado pacíficamente en el transcurso de varias horas. Al caer la noche, comencé a transmitir escenas en vivo de lo que estaba sucediendo afuera de la sede de la policía de Asbury Park, incluido el momento en que los manifestantes pidieron a los policías que se arrodillaran con ellos. Si bien la mayoría de los agentes de policía lo hicieron, algunos permanecieron de pie, como lo muestra el video que grabé. Column: Arrest of APP reporter covering Asbury Park protest part of a troubling trend Alrededor de las 9:30 p.m., un oficial de policía usó el megáfono de su vehículo para decirle a la gente que se fuera a casa. También noté que casi al mismo tiempo, la policía con equipo antidisturbios comenzó a acercarse al área. Presintiendo una confrontación, me puse el casco y las gafas protectoras. Se emitió al menos una advertencia más, pero con todo el ruido apenas fue audible. Buy Photo Gustavo Martínez Contreras (Photo: (Photo: Tanya Breen)) Un oficial de policía de Asbury Park me dijo que ya había pasado el toque de queda fijado a las 8 p.m. y me preguntó por qué todavía estaba allí. Le dije que era un periodista del Asbury Park Press cumpliendo mi trabajo de comunicar las noticias. Él me dijo: “¿Con que quieres probar la acción? Tendrás una probada de la acción, entonces"". El Asbury Park Press y otros medios de comunicación están normalmente exentos del toque de queda impuesto bajo una orden ejecutiva del gobernador. Antes de la protesta, el APP informó al jefe de policía de Asbury Park que estaríamos allí más allá del toque de queda y recibió garantías de que nuestros periodistas estarían exentos de la orden de regresar a casa. Otros policías me vieron grabando, miraron mi credencial y me preguntaron ""¿con qué prensa estás?"" Mi respuesta siempre fue la misma: estoy con el Asbury Park Press. George Floyd killing: Here's why bad cops remain on the force and what needs to be fixed Poco antes de las 10 p.m., la policía se agrupó con sus escudos y macanas, acorralando a los manifestantes entre ellos y los oficiales con los que los manifestantes habían tenido intercambios acalorados. Momentos antes, los oficiales se habían arrodillado con la multitud inconforme.

Costello) Al notar los escudos, los manifestantes levantaron sus manos y gritaron mientras avanzaban hacia los antidisturbios. Fue entonces que comencé a grabar de nuevo. Los manifestantes, otros medios y yo avanzamos lentamente hacia la policía antimotines y nos quedamos allí solo por unos momentos. Fue entonces cuando los oficiales que se habían arrodillado como señal de solidaridad un momento antes comenzaron a avanzar y empujar a la gente fuera de ahí. Fui empujado por un oficial de policía que inmediatamente se disculpó pero luego continuó empujando a la demás gente. Comencé a seguir a la multitud, deteniéndome para grabar intercambios y la carga de la policía. Traté de quedarme con otros periodistas que cubrían la protesta. George Floyd protest: Asbury Park rally was peaceful, but end of the night was not La acometida de la policía condujo a los manifestantes hacia el norte sobre Main Street. Los manifestantes, en su mayoría jóvenes negros y de otras minorías, giraron hacia el oeste en la avenida Monroe. La policía se paró en la intersección por unos momentos y luego continuó avanzando y exigiendo que la gente se fuera.

Otros en la parte de atrás tomaron gravilla suelta que encontraron y comenzaron a arrojar rocas a la policía. Esto duró solo unos momentos. Cuando la multitud se retiró, vi a algunas personas volteando contenedores de basura, pero nadie estaba destruyendo o vandalizando propiedades. Los policías cargaron nuevamente y me retiré con el resto de los manifestantes mientras seguía grabando. A veces me encontraba marchando con la policía y otras veces caminando con manifestantes. Health: Will large George Floyd protests lead to a spike in NJ coronavirus cases? Escuché fuertes gritos y me giré para ver gente corriendo hacia las vías del ferrocarril en Memorial Drive. Me apresuré hacia el área bajo el sonido de las aspas de un helicóptero que volaba sobre nosotros. Cuando llegué a Memorial Drive, vi a la policía rociando gas pimienta y me dirigí en esa dirección para documentar eso. Después de que me dijeran que ""me moviera al cara--"", caminé por la calle junto a los agentes de policía. Me di vuelta cuando escuché a alguien gritar detrás de mí. Fue entonces cuando vi a los dos jóvenes siendo detenidos violentamente. Un momento después yo también estaría en el suelo esposado. La policía de Belmar fue respetuosa en todo momento. Nos dieron mantas térmicas y agua cuando les dijimos que teníamos frío y sed. Aproximadamente una hora después de mi detención allí, un oficial de policía vestido de civil vino a mi celda para hacerme algunas preguntas. Quería saber si estaba con Antifa, el movimiento antifascista que el presidente Donald Trump está culpando, sin evidencia, de agitar los disturbios. Me preguntó si sabía qué era Antifa y si me habían invitado a unirme a Antifa en algún momento durante la protesta. Le dije que sabía lo que era Antifa por mi trabajo como periodista. Me preguntó para quién trabajaba y le dijo que era reportero de Asbury Park Press. ""¿Entonces solo estabas documentando lo que estaba sucediendo?"" preguntó. Antes de irse, me dijo que Antifa es un grupo terrorista y que debería tener cuidado de no liarme con ellos. Alrededor de las 12:30 a.m., un oficial de policía de Asbury Park vino a hablar conmigo. Me preguntó si era reportero del Press y le dije que sí. Me preguntó si tenía mi credencial conmigo, a lo que dije que sí. Tomó mi información y dijo: ""así que quedaste atrapado en medio de todo, ¿verdad?"" ""Estaba haciendo mi trabajo"", dije. Se fue diciendo que no pasaría mucho tiempo antes de que me dejaran ir. Dijo que tenían que procesarnos y darnos una multa por conducta desordenada. Se me permitió usar el teléfono. Llamé a mi novia para hacerle saber que estaba bien y pedirle que llamara a mis editores para que supieran dónde estaba. Finalmente fui liberado alrededor de las 3:30 a.m. La policía me devolvió mis pertenencias y me entregó una citación por ""deliberadamente"" no obedecer una orden de dispersarse. Poco después, noté lo que había estado ocurriendo durante mi encierro. Decenas de mensajes llegaron una vez que mi teléfono recibió servicio nuevamente. Llamé a mi novia que ya tenía instrucciones de mis editores. Telefoneé al editor de proyectos especiales Shannon Mullen, quien vino a recogerme. Me llevó a mi auto estacionado en el centro de Asbury Park. Regresé a casa. No pude dormir sino hasta la mañana del martes. Horas más tarde, supe que el Fiscal General Gurbir Grewal se había disculpado por mi arresto y dijo que los cargos en mi contra serían retirados. Eso ocurrió aproximadamente una hora después.

The dozens of rallies, especially in the state's largest cities, have the potential to be ""super spreader events"" where young asymptomatic demonstrators could transmit the virus to dozens of other attendees. ""This is absolutely the perfect storm for creating a cluster if not a second wave,"" said Mark Cameron, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""We're not talking the fall. We're talking right now."" The rallies come as Gov. Phil Murphy is touting how well New Jersey has reduced the risk of transmission through more than two months of strict social distancing and the shutdown of most businesses, schools and activities. But Murphy said this week that he has no intention of stopping the rallies on public health grounds — even though they defy his order to limit outdoor gatherings to no more than 25. ""Given the gravity of the killing and the stain of racism in this country, we have to acknowledge there is a desire and there is a right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said at his daily COVID-19 briefing Tuesday. ""I would ask [demonstrators] to please wear masks and keep social distancing."" NJ REOPENING: These are the NJ businesses and services that can reopen in the coming weeks 'We come in peace!': Hundreds flood Jersey City, where cops, protesters march together But while many demonstrators do cover their faces and protest organizers hand out masks, some participants remove their masks or don't wear any. And trying to maintain space has been difficult at some of the larger rallies, which began Saturday following the death of Floyd after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the African American man's neck for at least eight minutes. ""It's certainly possible that they can become what we call super spreader events,"" said Stephanie Silvera, a professor of public health at Montclair State University. ""What concerns me is that the rallies represent communities that have already been disproportionately hit by this virus,"" Silvera said. ""The people most hurt by this pandemic will continue to be hurt."" Of New Jerseyans who have died from COVID-19, almost 19% are black, while blacks make up 15% of the state's population. New COVID cases have dropped significantly over the past 45 days from 4,391 reported on April 15 to 708 on June 1. New Jersey has not seen a significant spike even though several rallies have been held to reopen New Jersey businesses. But those were minuscule compared to the George Floyd rallies that have attracted thousands in the state's biggest cities, including Newark, Jersey City and Camden, and have brought together groups in smaller communities, such as Englewood, Long Branch and Freehold. Most New Jersey rallies have been peaceful compared with places like Philadelphia and New York, where demonstrations have devolved into clashes with police and looting of stores. Murphy said there were at least 21 rallies scheduled statewide on Tuesday. Story continues after photo gallery The fact that the rallies are outdoors automatically helps curb transmission compared with something like an indoor business convention or church choir, where the virus was shown to spread like wildfire before the shutdowns. But protesters are also constantly yelling, chanting and cheering, which expels more droplets into the air and with greater force. ""Even if it's outside, you run the risk of transmitting the virus if you can't maintain the proper distance and wear a mask,"" said Anna Yeung-Cheung, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Manhattanville College in New York. ""You may see cases increase, but will we be going back to 700 dying a day like we saw at the height in New York? I don't think so."" Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

It showed that on March 30, one infected New Jerseyan was likely to infect five other people. After Murphy's stay-at-home order was issued, that rate plummeted to 1.04 by April 14 — the peak of COVID-19 hospitalization. It now stands at less than a person, at 0.88, as of May 30.

(Photo: New Jersey Department of Health) But contracting the virus is still very much a threat at outdoor activities so much so that Murphy and health officials have agonized over when and how to allow graduation ceremonies or limiting al-dresco dining. The time from exposure to COVID-19 to onset of symptoms is three to 14 days. But the real risk may not be to the protesters themselves, the vast majority of whom are young and are more likely to be asymptomatic or to develop minor symptoms. The risk is to older people with whom demonstrators come in contact. ""It's when they go home to visit their parents when the real risk occurs,"" Cameron said. ""Between the crowds you saw on Memorial Day weekend and now the rallies, you have a one-two punch that could really set this country back,"" Cameron said.

The modern gay rights movement was itself born in a moment of resistance on June 28, 1969, when a riot broke out at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village; police had raided the bar, enforcing a law against selling alcohol to homosexual patrons, and the community – including Edison native transgender rights activist Marsha P. Johnson – fought back. One year later, in June 1970, the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee held the first Gay Pride March. The annual New Jersey LGBTQ Pride Parade, Rally and Festival had been scheduled to happen in Asbury Park on Sunday, but the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers Jersey Pride Inc. to postpone the event to National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11. Pride Month: How LGBTQ community, allies will be celebrating differently due to COVID-19 “Our movement was born out of fire, bricks and blood at the Stonewall riots, and trans and queer women of color led that charge,” said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of education and advocacy organization Garden State Equality. “So it felt appropriate to stand with our black brothers, sisters and siblings against these injustices yesterday. Anything less than solidarity during this time only undermines the spirit and value of what Pride truly means.” Fuscarino was in attendance at Monday’s gathering in Asbury Park, just blocks from Garden State Equality’s Main Street headquarters. Speaking with the Asbury Park Press Tuesday morning, he said he was aware of growing tension and police presence as the evening progressed. “Ultimately, everything was peaceful from our perspective until a curfew needed to be enforced,” Fuscarino said. “When it comes to curfew, officers will say that they’re just following orders. But when will the good guys, quote-unquote, draw a line and say ‘Enough is enough’? The president is encouraging law enforcement to turn fire on citizens. Will they follow orders, quote-unquote, then?” Austin Bogues spotlights the changing development scene in Asbury Park and Neptune. He can be reached at abogues@app.com.

He needed help from the police. Instead he was kicked. Two years ago, the Asbury Park Press published a ground-breaking investigative series on police brutality called ""The Shield."" We exposed how government officials at all levels, even the courts, protected bad cops until they maimed or killed innocent people. The Press called for police reforms then and in subsequent stories. Some important changes were put in place, but in light of recent national and local events, much more still needs to be done. That is why we are bringing these stories back for you to read. Many recount uncomfortable, even horrific events, but each detail is necessary to understand what is happening in today's society. Police badge (Photo: heliopix, Getty Images/iStockphoto) As we saw with the George Floyd killing, a bad cop can turn into a killer within a matter of minutes. The Minneapolis officer charged with Floyd's third-degree murder, Derek Chauvin, had seven abuse complaints lodged against him since 2012 and three police-involved shootings, USA TODAY reported. He even held a teenager at gunpoint over a harmless Nerf toy gun. Looking for the trusted place to find the best home service providers? Find local pros. After each incident, Chauvin was investigated but remained on the force. That is, until he killed George Floyd as bystanders videotaped the horror. Then Chauvin and three assisting officers were fired. National protests and riots have gone on for a week. Four bad cops. A dead citizen. A nation torn apart. Buy Photo Protesters gather in Asbury Park to demand justice for George Floyd. (Photo: Peter Ackerman) All of these may have been prevented if police reform actually involved true reform. ""The Shield"" investigation found that a downward trajectory like Chauvin's is an all too familiar outcome in New Jersey and across the nation. Police chiefs, prosecutors, judges and even juries generally give police officers wide latitude in the use of force. Bad cops, we found, learn just one lesson — they feel emboldened to keep on hurting until someone is maimed or killed. Keith Briscoe died during a struggle with Winslow Police outside a Wawa convenience store on May 3, 2010. (Photo: DENISE HENHOEFFER/Courier-Post, Photo provided by the Briscoe fa) Police reform has come a long way since the racial unrest of the 1960s. But we still have a long way to go. The stories from ""The Shield"" go into great detail about what happened and what needs to be done. One story, called ""Pile on the rabbit,"" mirrors the Floyd killing. The only element missing was a bystander's video clip of cops piling on the man until he stopped breathing. His supposed offense? Hanging out in front of a convenience store too long to an officer's liking. Police reform starts with knowledge.

He's the problem!” That’s all I heard before an Asbury Park police officer tackled and arrested me Monday night while I was doing my job covering a protest and exercising my First Amendment rights. Just a moment before, I had recorded on my cellphone how several police officers tackled and arrested two minors who were retreating from advancing officers. Following police orders, I began retreating when police arrested me. The video — I was broadcasting live for APP.com viewers on Twitter's Periscope platform — cuts off right when they’re tackling me, although I tried to keep on recording. Another police officer assisting in the arrest slapped my phone out of my hand saying, “take down his f---ing phone.” The officer arresting me said, “don’t resist.” I replied, “I’m not resisting. I am a reporter.” Sen.

Asbury Park Press I was quickly handed over to another officer who asked what to do with me and was told to take me to a van into which other prisoners were being loaded. He asked what was hanging from my neck and I told him it was my press badge and that I was a reporter with the Asbury Park Press. He asked me to not give him any trouble and said he would be ""cool"" with me. I was calm throughout. The trusted place to find the best home service providers. Find local pros. They took my backpack, goggles and safety helmet before loading me onto the van. My badge was still dangling from my neck when we arrived at the Belmar Police Department headquarters, which was helping to process some of the people arrested at the protest. I had been transported with four other prisoners, including the two youths seen in my video beingtackled to the ground and arrested. Editorial: Reporters must not be charged or detained as they cover demonstrations I was so shocked by the brutality I had just witnessed that I really didn’t make much of my arrest, until later. I was more concerned with what had happened to those kids. I was on the scene to cover the protests sparked by the senseless death of George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police, in yet another painful case of police brutality. My duty was to cover the end of a protest that had gone peacefully over the course of several hours. As night fell, I began live-streaming scenes from what was happening outside the Asbury Park police headquarters, including the moment in which protesters asked police officers to take a knee with them. While most police officers did, some remained standing, as the video I recorded shows. At around 9:30 p.m., a police officer used his vehicle’s bullhorn to tell people to go home. I also noticed that about the same time, police in riot gear began nearing the area. Sensing a confrontation, I put on my helmet and protective glasses. At least one more warning was issued, but with all the noise it was barely audible.

I told him I was a reporter with the Asbury Park Press doing my job of reporting the news. He said to me, “So you want a taste of the action? You’ll get a taste of the action, then.” The Press and other media outlets are normally exempt from curfews under a governor's executive order. Prior to the protest, the Press informed the Asbury police chief that we would be there past curfew and received assurances that our journalists would be exempt from the go-home order. Other police officers saw me recording, looked at my badge, asked me, “What press are you with?” My answer was always the same: I am with the Asbury Park Press. Shortly before 10 p.m., police lined up with their shields and night sticks, sandwiching the demonstrators between them and the officers with whom the protesters had been having heated exchanges. Moments earlier, the officers had taken a knee with the protesters.

That’s when I began recording again. The protesters, other media and I slowly moved toward the police in riot gear and stood there only for a few moments. It was then that the officers who had taken a knee as a sign of solidarity began to surge forward and push people out of the area. I was shoved by a police officer who immediately apologized but then continued pushing people out of the way. I began following the crowd, stopping to record exchanges and the charge of the police.

The demonstrators, mostly black and brown youth, turned west on Monroe Avenue. Police stood at the intersection for a few moments and then continued charging forward and demanding people leave. Some young men screamed and challenged the police in the intersection. Others in the back began throwing loose gravel and rocks at the police. This lasted only a few moments. As the crowd retreated, I saw some people flipping trash containers, but no one was destroying or defacing property. The cops charged and I retreated with the protesters as I kept recording. Sometimes I found myself marching with the police and other times walking along with protesters. George Floyd killing: Here's why bad cops remain on the force and what needs to be fixed I heard loud screaming and turned to see people running towards the railroad tracks on Memorial Drive. I rushed to the area under the sound of the whirring blades of a helicopter flying above us. When we reached Memorial Drive, I saw police pepper-spraying people and I headed in that direction to document that. After being told to “f---ing move,” I walked down the street alongside police officers. I turned when I heard someone screaming behind me. That’s when I saw the two youth being violently detained. A moment later I would be on the ground getting handcuffed, too. We arrived at the Belmar police headquarters at around 10:30 p.m. Slowly they began processing the seven prisoners they had received, but they couldn’t do much because we hadn’t been charged with anything yet. I was locked in cell M4. Belmar police were respectful throughout. They gave us thermal blankets and water when we told them we were cold and thirsty. About an hour into my detention there, a plainclothes police officer came to my cell to ask me some questions. He wanted to know if I was with Antifa, the anti-fascist movement President Donald Trump is blaming, without evidence, for stirring up the riots. He asked if I knew what Antifa was and if I had been invited to join Antifa at some point during the protest. I told him I knew what Antifa was because of my job as a journalist. Health: Will large George Floyd protests lead to a spike in NJ coronavirus cases? He asked me who I worked for and told him I was a reporter with the Asbury Park Press. “So you were just documenting what was happening?” he asked. Before he left, he told me that Antifa is a terrorist group and that I should be careful not to hang out with them. At around 12:30 a.m. an Asbury Park police officer came to talk to me. He asked me if I was a reporter for the Press and I said yes. He asked me if I had my badge with me, to which I said yes. He took down my information and said, “So you just were caught in the middle of everything, right?” “I was doing my job,” I said. He left saying that it wouldn’t be long before I was let go. He said that they had to process us and give us a ticket for disorderly conduct. I was allowed to use the phone. I called my girlfriend to let her know that I was fine and to ask her to please call my editors to let them know where I was. I was finally released at around 3:30 a.m. Police returned my belongings and handed me a summons for ""knowingly and purposely"" failing to obey an order to disperse. Soon after, I noticed what had been transpiring while I was locked up. Dozens of messages came through once my phone received service again. I called my girlfriend who already had instructions from my editors. I called enterprise editor Shannon Mullen, who came to pick me up. He drove me to my car parked in downtown Asbury Park. I drove back home. I couldn’t fall asleep until early Tuesday morning. Hours later, I learned that Attorney General Gurbir Grewal had apologized for my arrest and said the charges against me would be dropped. They were, about an hour later.

TRENTON — State Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal on Tuesday announced the launching of a five-point plan, expected to include the licensing of all police officers in New Jersey, to strengthen trust between the law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The announcement comes in the wake of widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice that have occurred across the nation since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. A white police officer — Derek Chauvin, who pressed a knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes while he was handcuffed during an arrest — has been charged with third-degree murder in the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man. “Like so many Americans in this difficult time, I’m still reeling from the footage of George Floyd’s murder” Attorney General Grewal said during Gov. Phil Murphy’s daily news briefing. He said he is angry “that a white officer suffocated a black resident in broad daylight” while “three white officers watched and did nothing. I’m angry that these officers disgraced their entire profession and undermined the good work that so many others perform on a daily basis. ADVERTISEMENT “Mr. Floyd’s death reminds us that our country has a long way to go, not only in healing our nation’s racial divides, but also in addressing the systemic and implicit biases that affect all Americans,” he said. Demonstrations occurred across the nation and New Jersey including in Newark, Camden, Trenton, Atlantic City. In Asbury Park, a dozen people were arrested Monday night for failing to disperse after hours of peaceful protest, with several held and processed at the Belmar police station under a shared services agreement between the two municipalities. Attorney General Grewal quickly dismissed the charge against one of those arrested, an Asbury Park Press reporter, saying “In America, we don’t lock up reporters for doing their job.” Attorney General Grewal said the initiatives described Tuesday were in the works long before this week’s protests. He said he endorses a plan to mandate professional licencing of all 36,000 law enforcement officers in New Jersey, a requirement already in place in 43 states in the nation. “We must ensure that police officers meet a baseline level of professionalism, just like doctors, nurses and lawyers,” he said. He is working with police unions and law enforcement leaders to develop the training and certification program, which will be considered by the Police Training Commission in June for possible implementation. Attorney General Grewal said one of the most effective ways to reduce police use-of-force and death-in-custody incidents is by expanding the use of crisis-Intervention teams [CITs], which help officers respond to situations involving individuals with mental health issues. His office plans to build a statewide CIT-training program and will launch a pilot program with police departments in Atlantic City, Paterson, Trenton, and Millville, as well as State Police troopers assigned in Trenton. The Attorney General’s Office also will revise and update the use-of-force policy in New Jersey, something that hasn’t been done in 20 years, he said. He will issue a directive to implement the new policy for all law enforcement officers in the state by the end of the year. Development of the new policy will draw on data collected through a pilot use-of-force information portal that was recently completed and will be expanded for statewide use in July. The Attorney General’s Office also intends to develop an incident response team within the Division of Civil Rights that can be deployed to towns “following a major civil rights incident to help diffuse tension and heal the community.” The attorney general said in recent years his office has undertaken policing reforms designed to increase police professionalism, accountability and transparency. These include requiring statewide implicit-bias training and de-escalation training of police officers. Subscribe today!

The dozens of rallies, especially in the state's largest cities, have the potential to be ""super spreader events"" where young asymptomatic demonstrators could transmit the virus to dozens of other attendees. ""This is absolutely the perfect storm for creating a cluster if not a second wave,"" said Mark Cameron, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""We're not talking the fall. We're talking right now."" The rallies come as Gov. Phil Murphy is touting how well New Jersey has reduced the risk of transmission through more than two months of strict social distancing and the shutdown of most businesses, schools and activities. But Murphy said this week that he has no intention of stopping the rallies on public health grounds — even though they defy his order to limit outdoor gatherings to no more than 25. ""Given the gravity of the killing and the stain of racism in this country, we have to acknowledge there is a desire and there is a right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said at his daily COVID-19 briefing Tuesday. ""I would ask [demonstrators] to please wear masks and keep social distancing."" NJ REOPENING: These are the NJ businesses and services that can reopen in the coming weeks 'We come in peace!': Hundreds flood Jersey City, where cops, protesters march together But while many demonstrators do cover their faces and protest organizers hand out masks, some participants remove their masks or don't wear any. And trying to maintain space has been difficult at some of the larger rallies, which began Saturday following the death of Floyd after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the African American man's neck for at least eight minutes. ""It's certainly possible that they can become what we call super spreader events,"" said Stephanie Silvera, a professor of public health at Montclair State University. ""What concerns me is that the rallies represent communities that have already been disproportionately hit by this virus,"" Silvera said. ""The people most hurt by this pandemic will continue to be hurt."" Of New Jerseyans who have died from COVID-19, almost 19% are black, while blacks make up 15% of the state's population. New COVID cases have dropped significantly over the past 45 days from 4,391 reported on April 15 to 708 on June 1. New Jersey has not seen a significant spike even though several rallies have been held to reopen New Jersey businesses. But those were minuscule compared to the George Floyd rallies that have attracted thousands in the state's biggest cities, including Newark, Jersey City and Camden, and have brought together groups in smaller communities, such as Englewood, Long Branch and Freehold. Most New Jersey rallies have been peaceful compared with places like Philadelphia and New York, where demonstrations have devolved into clashes with police and looting of stores. Murphy said there were at least 21 rallies scheduled statewide on Tuesday. Story continues after photo gallery The fact that the rallies are outdoors automatically helps curb transmission compared with something like an indoor business convention or church choir, where the virus was shown to spread like wildfire before the shutdowns. But protesters are also constantly yelling, chanting and cheering, which expels more droplets into the air and with greater force. ""Even if it's outside, you run the risk of transmitting the virus if you can't maintain the proper distance and wear a mask,"" said Anna Yeung-Cheung, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Manhattanville College in New York. ""You may see cases increase, but will we be going back to 700 dying a day like we saw at the height in New York? I don't think so."" Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

It showed that on March 30, one infected New Jerseyan was likely to infect five other people.

(Photo: New Jersey Department of Health) But contracting the virus is still very much a threat at outdoor activities so much so that Murphy and health officials have agonized over when and how to allow graduation ceremonies or limiting al-dresco dining. The time from exposure to COVID-19 to onset of symptoms is three to 14 days. But the real risk may not be to the protesters themselves, the vast majority of whom are young and are more likely to be asymptomatic or to develop minor symptoms. The risk is to older people with whom demonstrators come in contact. ""It's when they go home to visit their parents when the real risk occurs,"" Cameron said.

The very definition of art is the expression of human imagination, and to claim that art shouldn’t be political, that it shouldn’t represent our foremost desires for society, is to deny that which makes us human in the first place. Our thoughts, our ideas and our feelings are borne from a place of great conviction, so its stands to reason that our art should be as well. Filmmaker Spike Lee has always approached his career from that vantage point. From his 1986 feature directorial debut She’s Gotta Have It to his upcoming Netflix film Da 5 Bloods, which arrives June 12, Lee has never compromised his values or point of view for the sake of art. Instead, it drives his creation. Whether or not the final products have always been widely celebrated by fans and critics is erroneous. What matters is that Spike Lee has never been afraid to comment on the moment. That’s what we need right now. Da 5 Bloods follows a group of Vietnam War veterans who return to Vietnam to search for the remains of their squad leader—and, perhaps, some buried treasure. Battling the forces of man and nature, these men are confronted by the lasting ravages of the immorality of the Vietnam War. Chadwick Boseman, Delroy Lindo, Jean Reno, Jonathan Majors, Paul Walter, Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock Jr. star. Having not seen the film, I can’t say for certain that a hungry audience will find connections to the ongoing protests against police brutality sparked by the killing of George Floyd in the custody of four police officers on May 25 . I can’t say whether or not the film will be a platform for #BlackLivesMatter. What I can say, however, is that a Spike Lee joint rarely lacks for relevancy. Do the Right Thing is an audacious and urgent snapshot of race relations and the battles both seen and unseen that result. Malcolm X profiles one of the most significant figures in American history and endured its own highly publicized battle about who should be telling Black stories in Hollywood. He Got Game is an accessible father-son story set against the backdrop of institutional and systematic corruption. BlacKkKlansman won a damn Oscar two years ago. You don’t need me to keep listing off the meaning behind his greatest hits because you’re already well aware. The point is that Da 5 Bloods arrives at a time when the world very much feels in need of Lee’s trenchant commentary, his deft handling of generational trauma, and his stylistic delivery of moral takeaways. There is no magic piece of art that will galvanize the good, expose the error of evils and put an end to the violence and pain currently gripping our country. Change, as much as we yearn for it, simply does not take root that way. But if there were one storyteller to emerge from this ordeal with a valuable contribution to the conversation, my money would be on Spike Lee. Da 5 Bloods could be his crowning career achievement or a forgettable footnote. It doesn’t really matter. What’s important is that Lee’s voice will be heard at a time when our country is most divided.",0.0

As a leader in the local African American community, I can say that the COVID-19 response by the city’s administration has not earned the appreciation and respect of our community. Failure to correct this unfolding scenario can rapidly dissipate any social capital and goodwill accrued in the last 48 hours. Under the administration of Mayor Kenney, local government has acted with disturbing insolence and nonchalance toward the African American community again and again. I have observed mean-spirited shunning and verbalized disdain for Black religious leaders and a lack of support for African-American-led groups. The Kenney administration has not done enough to ensure voters have access to ballots and the vote; it has withdrawn funding for violence prevention programming we have seen work and now, the wholly inadequate COVID-19 response. All of this indicates to me that, for the Kenney administration, Black lives simply don’t matter. Right now, city leaders must collaborate with African American leaders to stop the dangerous march of COVID-19 — quieter than the unrest surrounding us,. yet so deadly. We must come together around a comprehensive data set, coherent mediation strategy. We need a mutually vetted and trusted provider with a network of service sites in our neighborhoods. Already, the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium has mobilized to test nearly 5,000 people in Philadelphia and surrounding communities. The group has worked with multiple faith-inspired, civically motivated and socially committed Black organizations to fund and cooperatively stage testing in the neighborhoods and communities where people of highest risk for COVID-19 live, work and play. The city must now partner with this group to expand these efforts that have already proven to work.",0.0

While volunteers cleaned, the owner, who didn’t want to speak on the record, stared at his store in shock. “I want to live in a neighborhood that’s better than this,” said Ruth Elliott, a biochemistry instructor at the University of Pennsylvania that lives across the block. Elliott said she hasn’t been able to process the destruction and violence seen in her neighborhood over the last days. Especially because it affects a community that has already been suffering from both the coronavirus and the opioid epidemic. “In many ways, this is an area of the city that has been ignored and isolated for a long time,” Elliott said. “So in some ways, it feels like more of the same, but worsening.” Half a block away, Rosalind Pichardo and Clayton Ruley, the director of community engagement of the country’s largest syringe exchange, Prevention Point Philadelphia, picked up used syringes and cigarette butts. Pichardo, who founded Operation Save our City — an organization that works with families of homicide victims — after her brother was murdered, said the destruction and violence she’s been seeing in the neighborhood this week doesn’t make sense to her. The protests against police brutality and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police started peacefully, but the violence that came later stunned her. “This is supposed to be in honor of George Floyd. We’re not supposed to be taking any more lives here. This isn’t doing George Floyd any justice, by destroying your own community,” she said. Pichardo believes it was outsiders that started the riots that are hurting an already suffering community. Kensington has the highest drug overdose rate in Philadelphia, and it’s also one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city. During the pandemic, she has been providing free lunch daily to people in the neighborhood — and handing out Narcan, the opioid overdose reversal drug. But the violence has changed it all. Pichardo said the neighborhood’s homeless population are being moved from one place to another and instead of being able to feed people in a safe place, like she used to do, she’s been forced to deliver lunches by car. Businesses in Kensington have also lost stores they worked hard to maintain, while others keep losing jobs. “Everybody is affected by this, you know? People can’t go to the corner store now because they’re afraid,” she said. “You can’t be burning stores down for … in the name of who? I mean, George Floyd’s family didn’t want that and they clearly didn’t want the violence to continue.” Solomon Thomas, a bar and restaurant manager who lives in Kensington, said he went out to clean because he doesn’t want to see trash and debris on the street for days. “I want to be able to heal after it’s over,” he said. “As a Black man, I deal with stress daily, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t act. So here I am, doing my little part.” Violence is not what it’s all about Maria Gonzalez, president of HACE, spent all of Monday on Kensington’s commercial corridors, at Front and Allegheny streets, 5th Street and Lehigh Avenue, and Kensington Avenue. She says watching pharmacies and retail stores destroyed was stressful and disappointing. “In a community that is predominantly Hispanic and very low income. It is distressing to see that level of violence and destruction when we know how long it takes for us to be able to rebuild our communities,” Gonzalez said. “We suffer through years of disinvestment, decades of disinvestment, and it’s taking it decades to rebuild back. And to see it gone within a few moments, it is sad.” Gonzalez especially worries about small businesses — ones that are owned by people from the neighborhood. Most of them, she said, were already struggling not to lose their stores after the pandemic forced them to close their doors. “And the little they had, the inventory that they had, was now stolen. So many of them may not be able to open up again,” she said.",0.0

Rizzo, who rose to power in the late 1960s, when Philadelphia was becoming an increasingly segregated city, was sued by the U.S. Justice Department in 1979 for “condoning systematic police brutality,” The Washington Post reported at the time. “I remember what it was like then,” Kenney said of Rizzo era. “And in some ways it never changes.” Speaking to the protests against police brutality Philadelphia has seen daily since Saturday, the mayor said the recent demonstrations have “shown us the anger and distress that people of color have in this country,” pledging to work with the state Legislature and police union to reform the criminal justice system. Deandra Jefferson, with Philly for REAL Justice, has been fighting to remove the statue since 2017 when her group launched the “Frank Rizzo Down” campaign. Jefferson said placing the statue across the street from City Hall, a building that was supposed to be for everyone in the city, felt contradictory to the controversial history he left behind. “We know about him beating people brutally. We know about the way he treated the Black Panthers,” said Jefferson. “That statue, especially in that place, but anywhere in the city really, just didn’t make sense.” There was no word where the statue was taken. ___ The Associated Press and WHYY’s Ximena Conde contributed reporting.",0.0

Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John’s Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, “sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military’s leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders.” In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, “We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces’ reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. … Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it’s tin-pot dictatorial.” But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump’s threats to use military force against American citizens “irresponsible and destablizing.” “The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,” Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act.” The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon’s top two officials on Trump’s possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. “We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,” U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. “If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice.” Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation’s highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. “The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn’t have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,” Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors that Milley was “a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it’s being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge.” Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley’s role and authorities have not changed.",0.0

Mostly peaceful throughout the day, the demonstrators faced police officers, National Guard troops and other forces. President Trump called New York protesters “lowlifes and losers,” in a tweet posted Tuesday. Demonstrators throughout the country showed up, even in smaller towns such as Brattleboro, Vt., and Kingman, Ariz. Here are our updates on what is happening around the country: New York City Protesters gathered at places including the Barclays Center, Times Square and at the NYPD Headquarters Tuesday, and daytime demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Tuesday was the first day for the citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will stay in effect until at least Sunday, the mayor announced. Trump called on the city to bring in the National Guard in a tweet. New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. #SAVENYC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020  Mayor Bill de Blasio responded, “Thank God we have not had a loss of life in these last 5 days, but you bring outside armed forces into an equation they are not trained for…that is a dangerous scenario.” Police cars and a helicopter converged on one group of marchers blocking an intersection on the Upper East Side around 9 p.m. Protesters chanted “peaceful protest” and held their arms up as officers dispersed the crowd. Marchers told NPR they joined the rally in part because of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, but also because they’re convinced officers around the country are targeting black men. Many businesses were boarded up to prevent a repeat of Monday night’s looting. One business owner who stood outside his shop told NPR he was grateful for the heavy police presence. In Times Square, medical workers, who New York residents have cheered on throughout the coronavirus pandemic, came out to support demonstrations.

Officers blocked demonstrators from leaving, and protesters chanted “Let us through!” Los Angeles Angry residents called for Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to resign following days of unrest over Floyd’s death and multiple complaints of brutality by law enforcement. About 500 participants called to join a police commission meeting, causing connection delays. But after nearly an hour, with technical issues resolved, hundreds more residents were added. Many expressed outrage with Moore and saying the department has met demonstrations with an excessive use of force with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bangs and batons against peaceful and rioting demonstrators alike. Since Monday, Moore has drawn ire following remarks that protesters are “capitalizing” on the latest bouts of chaos, although he apologized on the Tuesday morning call, explaining he “misspoke.” “We will investigate each complaint, and I promise to hold accountable anyone who violates our policy or commits other misconduct,” Moore said, according to the LA Times. Moore noted there have been 13 officer-involved shootings since the start of the year. He added that more than 2,700 people have been arrested amid the protests — most for “failure to disperse” for curfew. Additionally, he said 27 LAPD personnel have been injured, including one hospitalized for a fractured skull and another for a broken knee. It is unclear how many protesters have been injured. Later in the day, more protesters gathered across the sprawling city, including in Hollywood, where armed National Guard members were stationed. About an hour before the countywide curfew went into effect, a massive column of demonstrators marched to Mayor Eric Garcetti’s home in Hancock Park, a wealthy neighborhood lined with palm trees and mansions. “I hear you that this isn’t just about the criminal justice system. This is also about society and where we put our resources,” Garcetti said in a news conference. “I choose to listen and move forward, and bring this city together to build peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,” Garcetti said. Garcetti calls for peace, saying “George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again.” Watch live: https://t.co/LWywHaWswy — KTLA (@KTLA) June 3, 2020  “George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again.” Hours past the curfew, demonstrators continued to flout orders to evacuate the streets. Washington, D.C. Large crowds showed up again a day after federal forces used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators at Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Protesters on Tuesday, primary voting day in The District, were peaceful. The Washington Post and DCist reported that thousands demonstrated, surpassing Monday’s crowd size. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also joined demonstrators on Tuesday. National Guard troops, the U.S. Park Police and Department of Homeland Security officers stood inside a 7-foot metal fence that was put up overnight and surrounded the perimeter of Lafayette Square, as protesters clung to the outside. At sunset, hundreds lay on the ground, face down, at the Capitol emulating the position in which Minneapolis police held George Floyd before his death. As it midnight neared, reporters said large crowds were still protesting peacefully, hours past the city’s 7 p.m. curfew. This is a developing story.

""I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr. Floyd, his family, our community and our state,'' said Ellison, the lead prosecutor in the case. During a town hall Wednesday, former President Barack Obama urged mayors to commit to police reform in the wake of Floyd's death and protests demanding police reform and racial justice. At least 9,300 people have been arrested in protests around the country, according to a tally by the Associated Press. Los Angeles has recorded 2,700 arrests, followed by New York with about 1,500.

Here's the latest news: Los Angeles to cut police budget by $100-150M to support 'communities of color' Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Wednesday announced that the nation’s second largest city would cut $100 million to $150 million from the police budget as part of a sweeping effort to make greater investments in the black community. As protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis continued through the country — including Los Angeles, where demonstrations have been peaceful at times but devolved into violence at other times — Garcetti said the city needed to “make a firm commitment to change, not just with words but with actions.” “We all have to step up and say, ‘What can we sacrifice?’ the mayor said. By making $250 million in cuts to “every department, including the Police Department,” Garcetti said the city would be able to invest in jobs, health care, education and healing for the black community “as well as communities of color and women and people who have been left behind.” The LAPD’s total annual budget is $1.86 billion, the Los Angeles Times reported. Former President Barack Obama urges mayors to commit to police reform Former President Barack Obama hosted a town hall Wednesday urging mayors in the country to commit to police reform in the wake of George Floyd's death that triggered protests nationwide. “What are the specific steps you can take?” Obama asked. The steps, he said, include reviewing their law enforcement's use-of-force policies with community members, and committing to report on any needed changes. Obama said his administration created a task force in 2014 after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that produced many reforms. Obama also supported protesters demanding police reforms and justice for Floyd. “We both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable, but we also have to translate that into practical solutions and laws that could be implemented and monitored and make sure we’re following up on.” In Los Angeles, local officials are acting quickly as protesters demand to defund the police department in the wake of Floyd's death. City council members introduced legislation Wednesday to cut funds from the LAPD in the 2020-21 budget to help disadvantaged communities and communities of color, reports the Los Angeles Times. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis: Donald Trump is threat to American democracy Former Defense Secretary James Mattis denounced President Donald Trump Wednesday in an extraordinary statement that hammered his former boss as a threat to American democracy. Trump is needlessly dividing the country and ""militarizing"" America's response to the protests, Mattis wrote in a statement published by The Atlantic magazine. The former general also offered a full-throated endorsement of the demonstrations, which have unfolded across the U.S. after George Floyd, an African American man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. Mattis took particular aim at the White House's decision Monday to forcibly clear protesters from a park in front of the White House so that Trump could walk across the street and pose with a Bible in front of a historic church. Mattis said it was an abuse of power. – Deirdre Shesgreen, USA TODAY 3 held on terror charges in right-wing conspiracy to spark violence during protests in Las Vegas Three Nevada men with ties to a loose movement of right-wing extremists advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government have been arrested on terrorism-related charges in what authorities say was a conspiracy to spark violence during recent protests in Las Vegas. Federal prosecutors say the three white men with U.S. military experience are accused of conspiring to carry out a plan that began in April in conjunction with protests to reopen businesses closed because of the coronavirus. Prosecutors say the men later sought to capitalize on protests over George Floyd's death. They were arrested Saturday on the way to a protest downtown after filling gas cans at a parking lot and making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles, according to a copy of the criminal complaint. – Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal Minnesota AG: Three officers will be charged and Chauvin faces second-degree murder Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said arrest warrants were issued Wednesday for former Minneapolis police officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, adding that they have been charged with aiding and abetting a murder. Ellison also announced that charges against former officer Derek Chauvin have been upgraded to second-degree murder from third degree. All four policemen were fired the day after Floyd's killing May 25, but only Chauvin had been charged until Wednesday. Floyd's deadly arrest, captured on video, has sparked protests against police brutality and racism across the nation. ""George Floyd mattered,'' Ellison said. ""He was loved. His family was important. His life had value, and we will seek justice for him and for you.'' In the video, Lane and Keung can be seen on top of Floyd, while Thao is standing by. According to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday, Thao stood by as Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe. Court papers describe Thao as being more concerned about controlling the nearby crowd than Floyd's welfare. ""The family of George Floyd watched the video in agony,"" family lawyer Benjamin Crump said. ""We cannot have two justice systems in America, one for black America and one for white America."" Robert E. Lee statue, other Confederate monuments to be removed in Richmond Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The Democratic governor will direct the statue to be moved off its massive pedestal and put into storage while his administration seeks input on a new location, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak before the governor’s announcement. “That is symbol for so many people, black and otherwise of a time gone by of hate and oppression and being made to feel less than,” said Del. Jay Jones, a black lawmaker from Norfolk. Also Wednesday, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced plans to remove the other Confederate monuments along Monument Avenue, which include statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate Gens. Stonewall Jackson and J.E.B. Stuart. Those statues sit on city land, unlike the Lee statue, which is on state property. Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposes use of military to quell unrest Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday he does not support use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement to quell violence erupting at some protests. Esper, speaking at a news conference, said the National Guard is ""best suited"" for supporting local law enforcement. Governors in more than half the states have called up their National Guards, and more than 20,000 guard members have been called to duty. Esper described Floyd's death as a ""horrible crime"" but said he does not support invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to override bans on the use of the military on U.S. soil. More protest coverage from USA TODAY Ex-President George W. Bush: Injustice and fear 'suffocate our country' Former President George W. Bush is calling for peace and empathy following the ""brutal suffocation"" of George Floyd. In a rare public statement, Bush said he and former first lady Laura Bush were ""anguished"" by Floyd's death and ""disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country."" Bush said they had ""resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen."" Bush, who has been critical of Trump, did not mention the current president by name but said, ""The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America – or how it becomes a better place."" – William Cummings, USA TODAY Lawsuit: Minnesota officers' treatment of journalists 'tramples Constitution' Police in Minnesota violated journalists' constitutional rights when officers pepper sprayed, fired rubber bullets at or otherwise attacked, injured or arrested members of the press covering recent protests, a class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday alleges. The suit claims that a pattern of attacks on journalists carried out by the Minneapolis Police Department and the Minnesota State Patrol ""tramples on the Constitution."" Jared Goyette, the named plaintiff in the suit, is a freelance journalist who says police shot him in the face with a less-lethal ballistic ammunition a week ago. The police and State Patrol did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY. – Ryan W. Miller, USA TODAY Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti backs police chief amid calls to fire him Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti expressed confidence in Police Chief Michel Moore, despite Moore's comments equating looters to the police officers responsible for the death of George Floyd. Moore has apologized and is fending off calls for his firing. ""We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd,"" Moore said Monday. ""We had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands, as much as it is those officers."" On Tuesday, more than 1,000 protesters marched through the streets of Hollywood, and several hundred demonstrated downtown, at times kneeling en masse and at others calling for Moore's resignation. Moore tweeted an apology and reiterated his regret at a Police Commission meeting Tuesday, saying he misspoke. ""If I believed for a moment that the chief believes that in his heart, he would no longer be our chief of police. I can't say that any stronger,"" Garcetti said. – Jordan Culver 64% of Americans sympathetic to protesters; 55% reject Trump stance Almost two-thirds of American adults were “sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,” while 27% said they were not and 9% were unsure, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday. More than 55% of Americans said they disapproved of Trump’s efforts, including 40% who “strongly” disapproved, while just one-third said they approved. That's lower than his overall job approval of 39%, the poll showed. Trump has been pressing mayors and governors to crack down on the protests, threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops to states. ’ More news about the George Floyd protests Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

The dozens of rallies, especially in the state's largest cities, have the potential to be ""super spreader events"" where young asymptomatic demonstrators could transmit the virus to dozens of other attendees. ""This is absolutely the perfect storm for creating a cluster if not a second wave,"" said Mark Cameron, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""We're not talking the fall. We're talking right now."" The rallies come as Gov. Phil Murphy is touting how well New Jersey has reduced the risk of transmission through more than two months of strict social distancing and the shutdown of most businesses, schools and activities. But Murphy said this week that he has no intention of stopping the rallies on public health grounds — even though they defy his order to limit outdoor gatherings to no more than 25. ""Given the gravity of the killing and the stain of racism in this country, we have to acknowledge there is a desire and there is a right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said at his daily COVID-19 briefing Tuesday. ""I would ask [demonstrators] to please wear masks and keep social distancing."" NJ REOPENING: These are the NJ businesses and services that can reopen in the coming weeks 'We come in peace!': Hundreds flood Jersey City, where cops, protesters march together But while many demonstrators do cover their faces and protest organizers hand out masks, some participants remove their masks or don't wear any. And trying to maintain space has been difficult at some of the larger rallies, which began Saturday following the death of Floyd after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the African American man's neck for at least eight minutes. ""It's certainly possible that they can become what we call super spreader events,"" said Stephanie Silvera, a professor of public health at Montclair State University. ""What concerns me is that the rallies represent communities that have already been disproportionately hit by this virus,"" Silvera said. ""The people most hurt by this pandemic will continue to be hurt."" Of New Jerseyans who have died from COVID-19, almost 19% are black, while blacks make up 15% of the state's population. New COVID cases have dropped significantly over the past 45 days from 4,391 reported on April 15 to 708 on June 1. New Jersey has not seen a significant spike even though several rallies have been held to reopen New Jersey businesses. But those were minuscule compared to the George Floyd rallies that have attracted thousands in the state's biggest cities, including Newark, Jersey City and Camden, and have brought together groups in smaller communities, such as Englewood, Long Branch and Freehold. Most New Jersey rallies have been peaceful compared with places like Philadelphia and New York, where demonstrations have devolved into clashes with police and looting of stores. Murphy said there were at least 21 rallies scheduled statewide on Tuesday. Story continues after photo gallery The fact that the rallies are outdoors automatically helps curb transmission compared with something like an indoor business convention or church choir, where the virus was shown to spread like wildfire before the shutdowns. But protesters are also constantly yelling, chanting and cheering, which expels more droplets into the air and with greater force. ""Even if it's outside, you run the risk of transmitting the virus if you can't maintain the proper distance and wear a mask,"" said Anna Yeung-Cheung, a virologist and infectious disease expert at Manhattanville College in New York. ""You may see cases increase, but will we be going back to 700 dying a day like we saw at the height in New York? I don't think so."" Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

It showed that on March 30, one infected New Jerseyan was likely to infect five other people. After Murphy's stay-at-home order was issued, that rate plummeted to 1.04 by April 14 — the peak of COVID-19 hospitalization. It now stands at less than a person, at 0.88, as of May 30.

The time from exposure to COVID-19 to onset of symptoms is three to 14 days. But the real risk may not be to the protesters themselves, the vast majority of whom are young and are more likely to be asymptomatic or to develop minor symptoms. The risk is to older people with whom demonstrators come in contact. ""It's when they go home to visit their parents when the real risk occurs,"" Cameron said. ""Between the crowds you saw on Memorial Day weekend and now the rallies, you have a one-two punch that could really set this country back,"" Cameron said. ""You have a lot of progress that can be wiped away."" Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.
