1615825449,2020-05-26 02:04:17,Goldberg: Jane Roe's pro-life conversion was a con,https://www.registerguard.com/opinion/20200525/goldberg-jane-roes-pro-life-conversion-was-con?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"In 2006, I went to Jackson, Mississippi, to report on the weeklong siege of the state’s last abortion clinic by the anti-abortion group Operation Save America. Flip Benham, then the group’s leader, had T-shirts made up, black with white lettering, saying, “Homosexuality Is Sin! Islam Is a Lie! Abortion Is Murder! Some Issues Are Just Black and White!” He wanted to burn a Quran at a demonstration, but couldn’t get a fire permit, so his group settled on ceremoniously ritually ripping one to shreds — along with a rainbow flag and printouts of hated Supreme Court decisions — and tossing them on an unlit grill. By his side was Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade. In 1995 Benham opened the headquarters of Operation Rescue, an earlier iteration of Operation Save America, next to the Texas abortion clinic where McCorvey worked, and converted her during her smoke breaks. In Mississippi, she tore up the decision bearing her alias, telling the abortion protesters: “You’re so beautiful. I’m so sorry for what I did.” That night, the group burned all the scraps in a church parking lot. McCorvey lit the match. It was a cultural coup for the right when McCorvey publicly turned against legal abortion. Jane Roe rejecting Roe v. Wade was something abortion opponents could throw in the faces of pro-choice activists. So it is a bombshell that McCorvey has revealed, in the posthumous new documentary “AKA Jane Roe,” that it was, at least in some sense, an act. “I am a good actress,” she said. The movie, which debuts on Friday on FX, also makes clear that anti-abortion leaders understood this. They’ve been perpetrating a scam on us all for 25 years. In the documentary’s final 20 minutes, McCorvey, who died of heart failure in 2017, gives what she calls her “deathbed confession.” She and the pro-life movement, she said, were using each other: “I took their money, and they put me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say, and that’s what I’d say.” In her career as a pro-life icon, she collected nearly half a million dollars. But at the end of her life, she once again affirmed a belief in the right to abortion, and evinced pride in Roe v. Wade. “Roe isn’t going anywhere,” she said early on election night in 2016, when she thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. “They can try, but it’s not happening, baby.” McCorvey is not the only convert in “AKA Jane Roe.” The film also features the Rev. Rob Schenck, once a militant anti-abortion leader who made headlines in 1992 for bringing fetal remains to an abortion clinic protest in Buffalo, New York. Though still an evangelical, Schenck has since moved away from the Christian right, first over guns and then over the movement’s support for Donald Trump, and he now says that overturning Roe v. Wade would cause “chaos and pain.” Speaking of McCorvey in the documentary, Schenck said, “I knew what we were doing, and there were times I was sure she knew, and I wondered, ‘Is she playing us?’ What I didn’t have the guts to say was, ‘Because I know damn well we’re playing her.’” Given the political damage done by her cynical about-face, it’s surprising how sympathetic McCorvey — campy, foul-mouthed and irreverent — comes off. She was a lost soul from a traumatic background. Her father was absent and her mother beat her, and she ended up in reform school after running away from home at 10. She entered an abusive marriage at 16, became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and lost custody of her first child. As she’s told the story, she signed up as the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade not because she wanted to make history but because she was desperate for an abortion. She never got one: By the time the case was decided, she’d given birth and put the baby up for adoption. Later, McCorvey resented not being given a more prominent role as a pro-choice activist. The movement found her embarrassing, especially when, in 1987, she admitted that she’d lied when she’d said the pregnancy at the heart of Roe was a result of rape. “The national movement, as far as I know, she was never really mentioned,” my friend Frances Kissling, the former president of Catholics for Choice, told me. “But if she did get mentioned it was with eyes rolling.” “She was not the poster girl that would have been helpful to the pro-choice movement,” Charlotte Taft, a former director of the Abortion Care Network, says in the film. “However, an articulate, educated person could not have been the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade.” It was women like McCorvey — those without the resources to travel to pro-choice states — who endured forced childbirth in the years before Roe was decided. “People who are plaintiffs in cases are usually messy people,” said Kissling. Many of the headlines about “AKA Jane Roe” have emphasized that McCorvey was paid to renounce abortion rights, but after watching it I don’t think it was all about money. McCorvey wanted respect and attention, to be honored and cherished. At times, people in the pro-choice movement tried to help her; for a while she was represented by the feminist superlawyer Gloria Allred. She made money giving speeches and selling the rights to her story, including for an Emmy-winning made-for-TV movie. But McCorvey was not a prize to the pro-choice camp as she was to the anti-abortion one. Benham cultivated her. He treated her like a star. “She was less defended, more needy,” said Schenck. “That was easy to detect, especially for those of us who were clergy. We were used to those kinds of personalities.” At the time of her Christian conversion, McCorvey was in a long-term relationship with a woman named Connie Gonzalez. Becoming a professional pro-lifer required her to disavow homosexuality, but she continued to live with Gonzalez — platonically, they said. (Knowing this, it’s heartbreaking to think back to McCorvey burning a rainbow flag.) For a while, according to a 2013 Vanity Fair article, Benham made sure both women were getting by, giving them about $200 a week. But eventually, even he tired of McCorvey. “She just fishes for money,” he was quoted as saying. Contemplating McCorvey’s deeply sad trajectory, I find it hard to hold her betrayals against her. The author of the Vanity Fair article, Joshua Prager, nailed it when he wrote, “McCorvey has long been less pro-choice or pro-life than pro-Norma.” But given all her disadvantages, someone had to be. She may have been a con artist for much of her life, but at one crucial moment she was a heroine. Some issues aren’t just black and white. Michelle Goldberg writes for the New York Times.",0.0
1616363452,2020-05-25 13:53:32,Israeli leader vows to push ahead with annexing West Bank,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200525/israeli-leader-vows-to-push-ahead-with-annexing-west-bank?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"JERUSALEM (AP) "" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pledged to annex parts of the occupied West Bank in the coming months, vowing to move ahead with the explosive plan despite a growing chorus of condemnations by key allies. The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Annexing large chunks of this territory would all but destroy the faint remaining hopes of a two-state solution. In an apparent reference to the friendly administration of President Donald Trump, Netanyahu said Israel had a 'historic opportunity' to redraw the Mideast map that could not be missed. Israeli media quoted him as saying he would act in July. 'This is an opportunity that we will not let pass,' he told members of his conservative Likud party. He added that the 'historic opportunity' to annex the West Bank had never before occurred since Israel's founding in 1948. The comments threatened to push Israel closer to a confrontation with Arab and European partners, and could deepen what is becoming a growing partisan divide over Israel in Washington. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. It has settled nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory, but never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition. But the Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. Trump's Mideast team is dominated by advisers with close ties to the settlements, and his Mideast plan, unveiled in January, envisions leaving some 30% of the territory under permanent Israeli control while giving the Palestinians expanded autonomy in the rest of the area. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, saying it is unfairly biased toward Israel. With Trump's re-election prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader's new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government in July. Netanyahu told party members in a closed-door meeting that 'we have a target date for July and we don't intend to change it,"" Likud officials said. The plan has already exposed a partisan divide in Washington. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee in the U.S. presidential elections, recently said that annexation would 'choke off' hopes for a two-state solution. 18 Democratic senators warned in a letter this week that annexation could harm U.S.-Israeli ties. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said annexation would violate international law and vowed to use 'all our diplomatic capacities' to stop it. Closer to home, the Palestinians last week cut off security ties "" a valuable tool in a shared struggled against Islamic militants "" with Israel to protest the annexation plan. Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that maintains behind-the-scenes relations with Israel, announced its 'rejection of the Israeli measures and plans to annex Palestinian lands.' The Arab League has condemned it as a 'war crime,' and both Jordan and Egypt "" the only two Arab countries at peace with Israel "" have harshly criticized it. Netanyahu spoke a day after beginning his trial on corruption charges. The prime minister launched a blistering tirade against the country's legal system when he arrived at court, accusing police, prosecutors and media of conspiring to oust him. As he spoke, hundreds of supporters cheered outside. Speaking to Likud on Monday, Netanyahu said he was 'very moved' by the support. Critics have said his attacks on the justice system risk undermining the country's democratic foundations.",0.0

Now, some 250,000 registered migrant laborers in Lebanon "" maids, garbage collectors, farm hands and construction workers "" are growing more desperate as a crippling economic and financial crisis sets in, coupled with coronavirus restrictions. Lebanon's unprecedented foreign currency crisis means that many migrants have not been paid for months or that the value of salaries is down by more than half. Others have lost their jobs after employers dumped them on the streets or outside their embassies. 'We are invisible,' said Banchi Yimer, an Ethiopian former domestic worker who founded a group that campaigns for domestic workers' rights in Lebanon. 'We don't even exist for our governments, not just the Lebanese government.' In just three days, she said, 20 Ethiopian domestic workers were abandoned by their sponsors and left outside the embassy. A video she posted showed women with as little as a backpack or a purse, lined up along the walls of the embassy "" some sitting on the floor. The pandemic delivered just the latest blow to a Lebanese economy, already devastated by a financial crisis brought on by decades of corruption and mismanagement. In recent weeks, the Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, has lost 60% of its value against the dollar and prices of basic goods soared. Unemployment has risen to 35% and an estimated 45% of the country's population is now below the poverty line. In this crisis, migrant workers are among the most vulnerable. Among them are 180,000 domestic workers, most of them women and many from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Thousands live illegally, after escaping their employers to whom they were tied under an ill-reputed sponsorship system, known in Arabic as 'kafala,' which dates back to the 1960s. Many are trapped, unable to go home, because they cannot afford the exorbitant costs of repatriation flights or because global air travel is severely restricted. Their plight is similar to that of migrant workers in other countries, including foreign laborers in oil-rich Gulf Arab states who now find themselves jobless, as COVID-19 stalks their labor camps. In the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the financial chaos has added to their despair. On Saturday, a Filipina domestic worker took her own life a day after arriving at a shelter run by the Philippines Embassy for workers waiting to return home after losing their jobs. In a statement Monday, the embassy said she died after jumping from a room she was sharing with two others. Both the Philippines Embassy and Lebanese authorities said they were investigating the death. Suspected suicides or escape attempts of foreign household workers have become a frequent occurrence in Lebanon, with local reports recording at least one incident a month. Such desperate acts are often blamed on the sponsorship system, which rights groups say creates near slave-like conditions. Some employers do not allow their helpers to go out on the street alone or have a day off. Domestic workers are not protected by labor law and are often shackled in a 24-7 work schedule with no right to resign. 'Some of their employers abuse them mentally physically and there is no law to protect them. Their employers ... treat them like slaves,' Brihanu said. A 2016 International Labor Organization study found that out of 1,200 employers surveyed, more than 94% withheld their workers' passports. Last week, security forces violently quelled a protest by Bangladeshi sanitation workers who were demanding an adjustment of their salaries to new market rates. The pandemic has also taken its toll. A few dozen foreign workers living in overcrowded apartments in Beirut have tested positive for the coronavirus. Riot police are often deployed outside their buildings to enforce isolation. Last week, Ethiopian workers staged a symbolic demonstration outside their embassy to demand free repatriation. 'We don't have the power to bring a plane and to take out everybody from this country. I wish we can do that,' said Tsigereda Brihanu, an Ethiopian activist with Egna Legna, Yimer's organization. 'Regular life in Lebanon is very difficult even to survive. It is not worth it to stay here.' One Ethiopian worker said that even though her sponsor still pays her salary, she is already checking into going home because she knows the dollars will run out and prices will continue to increase. 'Lebanon's finished,' she said, declining to give her name in order to speak freely. The virus lockdown has exacerbated work conditions. Some workers are not able to communicate with their own families and friends, the hours are much longer and the demands by employers are unrealistic, said Zeina Mezher of the International Labor Organization. 'They say that we are all in the storm, but it doesn't affect us all in the same way,' she said. Yimer, who founded Egna Legna in 2017, is now in Canada, where the group is registered as a non-profit organization, because it is illegal for domestic workers to be activists in Lebanon, and the government has refused to register a union for them. Egna Legna, meaning 'from us migrants to us migrants' in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language, now offers food packages for some who lost their jobs and helps others pay rent. 'I have not worked for nearly three months,' said Kumari, a household worker from Sri Lanka. Kumari used to hold down work in several homes in order to send money to her 5-year-old daughter who is being raised by her mother back home. 'Nobody has work. I want to go home but I can't until corona finishes,' she said.",0.0

The incident occurred on Sunday at approximately 7:10 p.m. when officers assigned to patrol Boston Common in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, were approached by several members of the public saying that they had seen a man lighting fire to the American flag and then throwing it onto the roof of a Boston Police prisoner transport wagon.  The car was parked near the fountain inside the park and was unoccupied at the time of the incident.  Officers responded to the scene and arrested 40-year-old Daniel Lucey who confirmed to the authorities that he had lit the flag on fire and thrown it onto the police car as a form of protest.  Over the weekend, 1,000 flags were planted on Boston Common by a small group of volunteers who organized a social distancing-compliant version of the annual flag garden, according to ABC News’ Boston affiliate WCVB-TV.  “Officers noted that the suspect was in possession of several other flags which appeared to be similar to the ones which are planted in front of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument over Memorial Day weekend to commemorate the Massachusetts service members who have given their lives in defense of the United States of America,” the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted to social media.  While speaking with the officers about the incident, the man then proceeded to spit at the authorities and hit one responding officer’s shoe with saliva.  The suspect was arrested and placed in custody at the scene of the incident.  Lucey is scheduled to appear in Boston Municipal Court on charges of Disorderly Conduct, Assault and Battery on a Police Officer, Malicious Destruction of Property and Malicious Destruction of Historical Monuments.

His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man’s neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect’s description in his car. “He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” Elder said in a statement. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn’t immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her “sick to her stomach” and she said it’s another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. “Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,” she said. “What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.” Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn’t breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a “need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,” and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. “If you’re sad, I get it, if you’re angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,” Frey said. “There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19.” Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers’ gun when he was shot. A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call. That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.",0.0

The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was 'no need for us to worry"" over the move being considered by China's ceremonial National People's Congress. 'Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,"" Lam said. 'Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.' Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong's international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. In Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that President Donald Trump is ""displeased with China's efforts and that it's hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub, if China takes over.' She declined to elaborate when asked to explain the statement further. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government's determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year's street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. Some 'foreign politicians' have 'expressed untrue opinions' about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target 'a minority,' citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong's streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong's Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong's government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law "" its mini-constitution "" to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem "" as often seen at soccer games "" along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong's Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi's tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China's intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi's difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0

(AP) "" Vowing not to back down after armed protesters gathered near his home and hung him in effigy, the governor of Kentucky on Tuesday condemned their use of 'fear and terror' in a demonstration fueled by coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Andy Beshear referred to the protesters as a mob in sharply condemning the weekend rally that spread to the Governor's Mansion, where his children play. And the Democratic governor bluntly accused some Kentucky politicians of culpability for attending a previous rally. 'Let's start by calling it what it was and what it is "" actions aimed at creating fear and terror,"" Beshear said of Sunday's rally. 'Crossing over barriers, standing on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids and hanging me in an effigy, that's an action intended to use fear to get their way."" Beshear said he would not be deterred by the demonstration. He has stressed the need to reopen the state safely, phasing in business restarts amid the health crisis. Non-essential retail stores and restaurant dining rooms have been among the reopenings, though with restrictions meant to adhere to social distancing. Beshear also has strongly urged the wearing of masks. 'I will not be afraid,"" he said at his daily coronavirus briefing. 'I will not be bullied. And I will not back down, not to them and not to anybody else.' The effigy was hung in a tree near the State Capitol during what was billed as a protest rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. The rally turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear's administration, according to media reports, with protesters chanting outside the Governor's Mansion for him to come outside. Beshear said Tuesday that the protesters have been 'embraced and emboldened' by some elected leaders. A handful of Republican lawmakers had attended a previous rally. Some prominent GOP leaders condemned the actions at Sunday's rally. Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the protesters' actions as 'completely outrageous and unacceptable.' Without naming anyone, the governor urged elected officials to no longer 'cater"" to such groups, saying: 'You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire."" 'You can't wait until something nasty and horrible happens to then claim it's wrong while you've catered the support of certain groups for votes or other reasons,' he added. Beshear said he doesn't regret moving his wife and their two children to the Governor's Mansion, located across the street from the statehouse grounds, but said security measures will be reviewed. He wondered aloud how the protesters would react 'if someone else who is armed walked up on their patio?"""" 'They walked up and stood on the front porch, and there, just a window pane away from where my kids play, the mob chanted and heckled,"" Beshear said. 'Thankfully, my kids weren't there that day. But I want to remind you they are 9 and 10 years old.' Kentucky State Police had little to say Tuesday about the protest. 'The Kentucky State Police does not comment on the level of security provided to protect the governor, nor any inquiries that we receive regarding these efforts,' said Sgt. Josh Lawson, commander of the agency's public affairs branch, speaking with the Lexington Herald-Leader. Beshear, the son of a former Kentucky governor, is known for his disciplined, even-keeled style. But he let his emotions show when pressed by reporters about the incident. 'I'm not going to let a bunch of jerks change the way that we're living our life,"" he said. Beshear made another statement about the protest during his briefing. Each day, he takes time to learn a few more words of sign language from a sign language interpreter. On Tuesday, the lesson he signed was: Love, not hate. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak",0.0

On May 13, leaders of global health, human rights and development institutions released a joint statement regarding COVID-19 in prisons, urging political leaders to use custodial measures only as a last resort in an effort to limit overcrowding. “These efforts should encompass release mechanisms for people at particular risk of COVID-19, such as older people and people with pre-existing health conditions, as well as other people who could be released without compromising public safety, such as those sentenced for minor, non-violent offenses,” the statement read. In Kenya, Skype and Zoom court proceedings led to the release of almost 5000 prisoners in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. The Supreme Court of the Philippines released almost 10,000 inmates the first weekend in May in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. However, some believe it may be too little, too late as two overcrowded jails on Cebu island had a combined total of 348 positive cases as of May 2, according to Al Jazeera. In March, Iran temporarily released approximately 85,000 prisoners from prisons including political prisoners in response to the pandemic. United Nations High Commissioner spokesperson Rupert Colville “welcomed the steps taken by some States to release convicts and pre-trial detainees most vulnerable to COVID-19, including those with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, the elderly, those living with HIV and those with a disability,” according to UN News. In some countries, however, releases believed to have political motives have faced backlash. According to Al Jazeera, Nicaragua has moved over 2,800 prisoners to house arrest, none of whom are imprisoned opposition figures. On May 4, Amnesty International released a statement calling for the worldwide release of all prisoners of conscience—-people imprisoned solely for their race, sexual orientation, religious, or political views—such as the opposition figures in Nicaragua. “It is more important than ever that states take urgent measures to protect all those who are behind bars, including by releasing all individuals who are held simply for peacefully exercising their rights,” said Sauro Scarpelli, deputy campaigns director at Amnesty International in the statement. Many of the at least 84 opposition leaders were arrested in a 2018 protest against Daniel Ortega, a formal rebel now accused of running a repressive dictatorship. According to Amnesty International, 12 of the opposition detainees exhibited COVID-19 symptoms and were not provided adequate medical care. In Turkey, where confirmed cases have since reached over 150,000, parliament passed a bill on April 13 that would temporarily or permanently release tens of thousands of inmates to minimize overcrowding in their jails. According to Amnesty International, the releases did not include those held in pretrial detention and people convicted under overly broad anti-terrorism laws. Due to the county’s vague anti-terrorism laws, the bill excludes convict journalists, lawyers and political and human rights activists who have been convicted of terrorism and imprisoned for speaking out against the government. In other countries, the fear of contagion with continued overcrowding and lack of basic services has caused deadly riots. In late April, a riot broke out in the Miguel Castro Castro jail after two prisoners died of COVID-19. The riot left nine prisoners dead and 60 guards, five police and two additional inmates injured as reported by BBC news. The overcrowded jail, located in Lima, Peru, continues to house approximately 5,500 inmates despite an official capacity below 2,000. Peru’s prison authorities report over 600 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 13 case-related deaths. The week of the riot, Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra announced he would grant 3,000 of the most vulnerable prisoners a humanitarian pardon in order to ease prison overcrowding. However, tens of thousands of inmates would still remain wanting better sanitation and health care. According to Amnesty International, Los Llanos Penitentiary Centre, known as CEPELLA, in Venezuela placed restrictions on family visitations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March. Similar to other overcrowded prisons in the country, the 4,000 inmates rely on family visitations for food. As food shortages increased throughout the country, prisoners accused officers of provoking inmates with the new restrictions and stealing what food they were able to receive. On May 1, prisoners crowded the main entrance and demanded change. The riot left at least 47 prisoners dead and an additional 75 injured, according to Reuters. The consistent overcrowding in Venezuelan prisons is due in part to over 60% of the prison population being pre-trial detainees, or people who have yet to be convicted of a crime. Despite the overcrowded, unsanitary conditions and riots, the Venezuelan government has not announced any plans to release prisoners in response to the pandemic. “We already had an explosive situation [in the jails]. COVID[-19] is just the spark that’s going to set the whole thing off,” said Alexandre Sales, a criminal lawyer in Brazil, to The Guardian.    ",0.0
1618105959,2020-05-27 07:49:17,Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200527/swift-firings-for-minneapolis-officers-in-death-of-black-man?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. 'I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?' said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.' The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired "" an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote 'murderer' in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. 'We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,' Crump said in a statement. 'We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.' Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to 'be respectful.' He said he was working to change the department's culture. 'One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,' he said. The chief defended the department's use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night's protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota's two top law enforcement officials "" Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black "" promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor's call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. 'I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it's important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,' Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had 'outraged us and people across the country' and that the case 'deserves the best we can give.' The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd's death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis 'a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to 'look at it.' Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was 'part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country' and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.' It also 'sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don't think that's enough.' A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an 'unresponsive, pulseless male,' the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. 'We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said. ""There's somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes "" every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.' ___ Long reported from Washington.

1618453804,2020-05-27 16:37:13,"Column: Deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd are why Kaepernick knelt",https://www.registerguard.com/sports/20200527/column-deaths-of-ahmaud-arbery-george-floyd-are-why-kaepernick-knelt?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"When Colin Kaepernick started kneeling in 2016 to create awareness toward systematic racism and police brutality, the then-NFL quarterback became a symbol of what America has become. We’re a nation that’s divided. Four years after Kaepernick took a knee during the playing of the national anthem, he’s been blackballed from the NFL for three years. And nothing seems to have changed in society, in light of Ahmaud Arbery’s death at the hands of vigilantes who hunted him down and shot the 25-year-old black male as he jogged in their Brunswick, Ga., neighborhood, and the recent killing of George Floyd, a Minnesota man whose pleas were ignored as a police officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. “Please, I can’t breathe,” Floyd was caught on a bystander’s video as saying while handcuffed and pinned down by officers on the scene. One of those officers had his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. “Everything hurts,” Floyd said. “They’re going to kill me.” And that’s exactly what these four officers on the scene, who were supposed to protect and serve society, did to this 46-year-old African American male. All four were fired Tuesday, but charges haven’t been filed, and arrests haven’t been made. History tells us getting justice for Floyd will be just as much of an uphill battle as it is to get justice for Arbrey, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Eric Garner, all unarmed people of color whose deaths have inspired Kaepernick’s protest and the Black Lives Matter movement. And the truth is, without video evidence of exactly what happened, the world would never know the truth, and most of society probably wouldn’t care. Floyd would be dead, and those former officers would still have a job policing society, pretending to create law and order because of their creative writing skills on an incident report. Without video evidence, we could continue to believe that Floyd was just another threat to society. Or to put it in simpler terms, he was just another black man like my father, my brother and my son. Think about how many times during the course of a month, the year, this decade — or better yet your lifetime — incidents like this have happened in your community to people of color and it wasn’t caught on video. How many times has someone been victimized by police brutality or overall bigotry that didn’t create an outrage? This isn’t OK. But more importantly, it has never been OK. Yet it keeps happening. Ask yourself why, and then ask yourself what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about yet another black man who was murdered at the hands of the police officer employed to protect and serve? That unnamed officer knelt on Floyd’s neck with conviction for several — not a couple — minutes as Floyd pleaded for his life. You have to wonder if Arbery pleaded for his life too, as armed men in two vehicles chased him up and down that Georgia neighborhood before finally catching him and shooting him in a February confrontation that was caught on video. It took three months for the men involved in that fatal encounter to be arrested, and that likely only happened because a video started circulating on social media, bringing his death to a national platform. Not everyone feels our pain and anguish, and Kaepernick certainly taught us there is a price to speaking up about what is going on in America regarding social injustice and police brutality. Kaepernick sacrificed his playing career because he wouldn’t back off his movement, he wouldn’t stop kneeling, and the NFL made him an example for those who wanted to follow. There’s a community of people suffering from what Kaepernick and other NFL players, many of whom where Dolphins players, have been trying to create awareness for. The problem is many choose to ignore our plea like that officer ignored George Floyd. Are you listening because these incidents, the deaths Arbery and Floyd, resonate in troubling and familiar ways? How many more must die before America realizes people of color are treated beneath the protection of the law, and that our lives matter too? What is happening is a recurring problem, and it will continue unless we confront it, properly examine the problem and the issues, and actually take a stand for the exact reason Kaepernick knelt.",0.0
1618736027,2020-05-28 03:00:49,The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Trees — For Now,https://www.eugeneweekly.com/2020/05/28/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-trees-for-now/,en,False,,79528,eugeneweekly.com,http://www.eugeneweekly.com/#spider,"Thurston Hills is home to one of the few trails in the nearby area where you can barrel down at high speeds on a mountain bike without worrying about hikers and other pedestrian traffic. But now the only thing moving as fast as a biker shredding a trail is the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to OK logging at its property next to the Springfield trail system. Environmental groups and neighbors are concerned about the BLM’s decision to allow Seneca Jones Timber to log the area because of the fire risk. The BLM and Seneca say the project will result in a better recreational area — although the federal agency did offer an option where it builds additional trail systems without the logging. On May 18, the BLM announced it would continue with the timber sale at its property near Thurston Hills, just outside Springfield. The announcement came after the agency lost a case against Oregon Wild and Cascadia Wildlands last year. The ruling was that the BLM had to issue a revised environmental assessment report. “But it remains to be seen whether they’ve actually fixed those mistakes,” says Nick Cady, legal director for Cascadia Wildlands, adding that further legal action is likely. The process is moving forward quickly because the BLM marks activities like processing applications for logging operations and timber sales as a critical function during a pandemic, according to documents obtained by Eugene Weekly. The timber harvest outside of Thurston Hills is also known as Pedal Power. When the BLM initially introduced its timber harvest plan in 2017, it upset Springfield, one of the most pro-timber cities in Oregon. So the city of Springfield and Willamalane wrote a letter of protest to the federal agency. The agency revised its plans. It will downsize the harvest from 150 to 92 acres and will add 8.5 miles to the trail system there, Kenny Weigrandt, community engagement program manager at Willamalane Park and Recreation District, tells EW in an email. The BLM’s harvest plan includes harvesting trees up to Willamalane and BLM’s shared property line. Weigrandt says that a 150 to 200-foot vegetative buffer will be maintained between the harvested area and the Thurston Hills’ trails. In a September 2019 ruling, U.S. District Judge Michael McShane found that the BLM did not adequately analyze or publicly disclose the fire hazards near the Pedal Power project, which deprived the public of meaningful participation. McShane said the BLM did not include a report from its fuels specialist who reported that cutting down mature trees and replanting “early successional” trees would change the fire hazard from low to moderate to high. The BLM even hid the fuels specialist’s identity so the report would be hidden from public records. The court ruling adds that this means the area could have a high fire risk for the five to 20 years after replanting new trees. In response to potential questions from the public, the BLM’s fuels specialist said the agency would analyze the fire hazards further. But it never did, and the BLM even cut the fuels specialist’s report from 18 pages to a single sentence in its 2018 Environmental Assessment report, according to McShane’s ruling. A spokesperson for BLM says the agency met the concerns of Judge McShane. On Feb. 4, the BLM released a new environmental assessment. The 103-page report covered more of the fire hazards posed by the project and its alternatives. And logging the area and the associated fire risk is what concerns many residents in the Thurston neighborhood. Ronna Frank, a Thurston resident, tells EW that she and other neighbors are working with the city of Springfield to ensure their properties are maintained to avoid fire risks. “We’re not activists,” Frank says. “We’re property owners who don’t want their properties to burn down.” Seneca purchased the Thurston timber for about $1 million. The company’s spokesperson, Casey Roscoe, says Pedal Power isn’t technically a “clearcut” and that environmental groups like Cascadia Wildlands are misusing that word. But Cady says Thurston Hills will be a clearcut. He says in regenerative planting, the BLM leaves about four to six mature trees per acre and plants “spindly” trees that the wind knocks over because there isn’t a canopy of trees protecting it. “All of those trees they’re supposed to retain, they’re bunching around the mountain biking trail,” he says. “There’s going to be nothing. They’re going to bulldozer everything.” The BLM said in its Feb. 4 environmental assessment report that it plans to re-harvest the timber it successfully grows again in 10 to 20 years, which Cady sums up as turning the area into a “perpetual timber plantation.” Weigrandt and Roscoe both say they are excited for the recreational result of the logging project. “This is a place that has never been accessed before,” Roscoe says. “It will give us something that’s so special, that’s such a jewel.” She says the project is being held up by Oregon Wild and Cascadia Wildlands because the two nonprofits are creating a “false narrative” around Pedal Power. Murray McLeod, a resident of the Thurston neighborhood, counters Roscoe, saying, “A narrative can be a statement of facts.” McLeod adds that he and his neighbors are active on the social media website NextDoor, and a number of neighbors want to see Pedal Power die. Out of the four proposals the BLM explored in its Feb. 4 environmental assessment report, one alternative would result in a trail system without a timber harvest. The report says the cost to build the trails would be about $343,275, but wouldn’t result in timber-related revenue for the agency. In the report, the BLM says that alternative would offer about 20 miles of a combined trail system, providing a “much-needed recreational opportunity” for the Eugene-Springfield area, that would offer high quality mountain biking and hiking experiences into the future. But a BLM spokesperson says the purpose of the Pedal Power project is to create a recreational trail system and sell timber. The agency is required by law to harvest a certain amount of timber per year. McLeod says the trail-only alternative would have been an acceptable option. But for now, the recreational future of the Thurston area will be what McLeod calls “an overgrown Christmas tree farm.” “Even though this project is supposed to build new mountain biking trails, it’s not worth the hassle and reduced beauty of the area,” he says. “Exchanging these older growth forests with these regenerative forests, it’s not a tit for tat.” The 15-day period to submit a protest ends Tuesday, June 2. The BLM is only accepting protests via mail or hand delivery via appointments. Call 541-683-6600 to make an appointment.",0.0

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

1619101069,2020-05-28 07:15:25,Employee fired after hanging effigy of Kentucky governor at protest,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/employee-fired-after-hanging-effigy-of-kentucky-governor-at.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"RiverNorthPhotography/iStockBy BILL HUTCHINSON, ABC News  (FRANKFORT, Ky.) -- Democratic and Republican leaders denounced gun rights supporters for hanging an effigy of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear from a tree outside the state capitol building during a Memorial Day weekend demonstration.  The symbolic lynching occurred on Sunday at a rally by gun rights groups that was initially organized to celebrate Second Amendment freedoms to bear arms. But as the rally in Frankfort went on, it turned into a protest against Beshear's coronavirus-prompted stay-at-home orders.  As country singer Lee Greenwood's hit song ""God Bless the U.S.A."" played in the background, a demonstrator wearing camouflage pants and what appeared to be a holstered handgun strung a rope over a tree limb and with the help of another man hoisted the effigy bearing a picture of Beshear and a handwritten sign tacked to it reading, ""Sec Semper Tyrannis,"" a Latin phrase meaning ""Thus always to tyrants.""  Video of the episode, taken by a reporter from the Courier-Journal newspaper of Louisville, showed at least one child standing next to a baby carriage as she watched the adults hang the Beshear effigy.  At least one unnamed member of the group was fired from their job at Neil Huffman Auto Group on Tuesday, according to a statement.  ""The Neil Huffman Auto Group does not condone threats of violence in any form, whether they be a call to action or an implied threat,"" Shannon Huffman, the company's human resources manager said. ""Following an internal investigation on this matter, the employee was terminated. There is no place for hate or intolerance at any of our dealerships.""  At a press conference Wednesday, Beshear called it ""an act intended to create fear and terror.""  While the group Take Back Kentucky posted a notice on its Facebook page advising members of protests at the capitol building on Saturday and Sunday, a spokesman for the group denied members were involved in organizing or sponsoring the event.  ""We notified our members that there was going to be two separate events and to let people take their choice to go to whichever one they wanted to. We were in no way involved with the planning of it, the organization of it and we had no knowledge of what was going to take place,"" Richard Treitz, moderator of Take Back Kentucky, told ABC News.  ""We believe in the Constitution. We believe in the Second Amendment,"" Treitz said. ""We're not in favor of these lunatic activities like an effigy and we absolutely condemn things like banging on the windows of the Governor's Mansion.""  On the group's Facebook page, it informed its members that ""we will have guest speakers to talk about the virus, and how this shutdown will not only wreak havoc with the economy over the next several years, but also threaten our fundamental freedoms and the character of America for generations.""  The Courier-Journal reported that the effigy hanging took place outside the state capitol building after about 100 demonstrators marched to the Governor's Mansion yelling for Beshear to come out.  ""Come out, Andy!"" protesters chanted.  It was not clear if Beshear was home at the time. The governor, a Democrat, has yet to issue a response to the protest.  As images and video of the effigy being strung up went viral, political leaders from both sides of the aisle condemned the act.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, issued statement calling the incident ""unacceptable"" and saying ""there is no place for hate in Kentucky.""  Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, a Republican, took to Twitter to denounce the incident.  ""This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly,"" Adams wrote.

1619379954,2020-05-28 03:00:00,Washington County businesses wary ahead of June 1 reopening,http://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/468320-379281-washington-county-businesses-wary-ahead-of-june-1-reopening,en,False,,1392,canby herald,http://canbyherald.com/,"Washington County businesses wary ahead of June 1 reopening Some business owners plan to reopen as soon as the county is cleared to enter Phase 1. Others don't. On Tuesday morning, May 26, Mike Soto sat down at his computer to strategize. Soto owns Pizzario and Noble Hop Bierhaus, two businesses in downtown Hillsboro. Like restaurant owners around the world living in communities about to loosen restrictions on dine-in service, Soto was eager to reopen — but he considered how he could do it safely for his staff and customers, and in a way that would increase revenue lost due to the coronavirus. ""It's kind of like a Trail Blazers team,"" Soto said. ""I'm the coach and I'm just kind of thinking, 'OK, what's our play, what's our gameplan here? How do we beat the COVID-19 team?' My brain is spinning to prepare and be creative."" Washington County submitted its plan to enter Phase 1 of Gov. Kate Brown's three-phase, conditional approach to reopening certain sectors of the economy on May 22. County officials expect to receive state approval, allowing restaurant owners such as Soto as well as salons, gyms and retail stores to reopen with limited service, on June 1. But many restaurant owners, including Soto, are taking a more cautious approach. Soto said he isn't sure when he will reopen for dine-in service, but he doesn't plan to reopen on June 1. Instead, he will continue doing take-out service only while he comes up with a plan and observes how other businesses handle the first phase of reopening. ""Honestly, I'm not sure yet,"" Soto said of how he'll move forward with his own businesses. ""There's a lot to think about."" Soto considers how he will arrange seating to allow all parties to be spaced six feet apart, accommodate larger parties up to 10 people, create single-use menus and train staff to properly sanitize dining surfaces after each use, among other requirements from the Oregon Health Authority. He's also thinking about how he will implement other safety measures recommended but not required by the OHA, including designating an employee to manage the flow of customers in a single direction through the restaurant. Other business owners in Washington County plan to reopen for in-person service on June 1. David Esparza owns Faded Up Barber Shop in Forest Grove. He said he plans to start taking clients for appointments as soon as he can. Esparza said his phone has been ringing with people calling to ask when they'll be able to get a haircut continuously since the pandemic began. ""I never stopped getting phone calls,"" Esparza said. ""They're like, 'Put me on standby. As soon as you hear what's up, let me know, I'll take the day off of work if I have to.'"" Esparza has his own OHA requirements to meet. He's planning to ask clients, whenever they call for an appointment, a series of questions about whether they've recently had symptoms of illness. He'll also be asking them to remain outside of the shop until it's time for their appointment. Razors, scissors and other tools of the trade have to be disinfected between cuts. So do the seats in which customers sit. Esparza also plans to require all customers to wear face coverings when they come for an appointment — a measure recommended but not required by health officials. He worries he will face backlash from clients who think it's an infringement on their personal liberty. He has watched as people downplay the contagiousness of COVID-19 and protest lockdown orders at state capitols. ""I know a lot of people feel like their liberties are getting taken away — but I'm not forcing you to come to my barbershop, you're choosing to, and if you choose to, then you have to follow these protocols,"" Esparza said. On May 20, the Forest Grove Police Department asked residents to respect business owners' policies in a post on Facebook ahead of the expected reopening. ""Creating mask policies are within business owners' rights, similar to requiring customers to wear shoes and a shirt to receive service,"" the post read in part. ""Their request is based on continuing to keep you and our community safe. We ask you to please be polite."" Community support has been crucial for businesses like Soto's. That continued patronage has allowed Soto to keep half his staff running take-out service, he said. Still, he'll need to hire people back or look for new employees to reopen for dine-in service, which is posing another hurdle, he said. ""You can't just say, 'OK, come on back, John. You get this table, you get that table,'"" Soto said. ""No. There are big changes."" And even still, Soto isn't sure he'll be able to bring in enough revenue to make reopening worth it. ""It's really hard to say,"" Soto said. ""I don't know if a lot of people are ready to come out yet. There are some people who are really excited, saying, 'We can't wait,' but there's still a lot of people who are kind of like, 'I don't know, maybe we'll stick with the take-out.'"" Soto has been in the restaurant business for almost 40 years, opening 21 restaurants, he said. He has owned ""ma-and-pop restaurants to corporate to franchise to fine dining,"" Soto said. ""I've rescued restaurants from going down the tube between that '08-'09 tank-down. I'd like to think that's the only advantage that I've had. I'm new to this. I've never experienced this."" Soto said coming up with creative ways to bring in customers will also be important to being profitable when he reopens. He has continued to have live music at Pizzario by allowing bands to play outside at a distance as customers stop in for take-out. It could be as long as a week or more after June 1 before Soto reopens, he said. The main reason Esparza plans to reopen as soon as possible is to start making money again so he can help provide for his wife, who works at a residential care facility, and his five stepchildren, four of whom live at home, he said. Since closing, Esparza has taught himself how to design shop logos and other images on his computer to print on T-shirts, with the hope that selling them to his loyal clientele will bring in some extra cash. But another reason Esparza is particularly eager to reopen is for his mental health, he said. Opening up the barbershop in 2016 has allowed him to get his life on the right track, Esparza said. Court records show he was convicted of second-degree assault and went to prison when he was 16 after being involved in gang-related activity, he said. He later had additional stints in prison after being convicted on identity theft and violation of a court's stalking protective order charges, court records show. He learned to cut hair in prison and got his license after leaving, he said. Since Esparza opened the shop, the routine and the community he has developed have helped manage post-traumatic stress disorder, which he says was a result of prison. He said not being able to work has been difficult. ""The thing I miss the most is the interaction with the community,"" Esparza said. ""The first two weeks after we shutdown, it was really, really, really, really, really hard. But I've been able to build myself a new routine. I can't wait to reopen again.""",0.0

Chanting slogans such as ""shame on Seneca"" and ""no clear cuts during COVID,"" they organized to protest plans to cut down 109 acres of Bureau of Land Management forest by Thurston Hills Natural Area near a residential neighborhood. The protest was organized and attended by conservation groups and homeowners in that area. ""The issue is whether to clear cut a pristine area that’s very close to Springfield and is a great opportunity for recreation,"" said Springfield homeowner Murray McLeod, who bikes and hikes in the forest land. ""There are alternatives to this project."" The timber sale is part of a plan to build new bike trails through the area. The project is not a clear cut operation, a BLM spokeswoman said. A court ruling last year blocked BLM approval for cutting patches of timber there, ruling BLM didn’t fully analyze or publicly disclose the risk of fire from the harvest. The ruling also required BLM to establish a buffer, known as a recreation management zone, before any logging can begin on that forest land. BLM since has revised its plan. In her May 18 decision determining the impact of the revised plan, Rebecca Brooke, Upper Willamette field manager of the BLM’s Northwest Oregon District Office said, ""It is my determination that none of the project alternatives would have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not necessary and will not be prepared."" Seneca Sawmill Company Senior Vice President of Public Relations Casey Roscoe said in an email the groups opposing the sale and protesting Thursday are spreading ""completely false information to persuade the public and legislators, and use fear to get people to write them checks."" Roscoe took issue with calling the project a clear cut because it will be done in patches ""and even the harvested patches will have standing trees left in them,"" claims that fire risk will increase and suggestions from those groups Seneca is trying to use the pandemic as a veil to keep the timber harvest out of the public eye. ""Trying to incorporate it into the messaging is an attempt to capitalize on a global pandemic and use fear as a tool,"" Roscoe said in the email. Despite BLM’s plan revision, protesters Thursday still oppose the project. ""It’s putting local communities at increased risk of wildfire,"" said Dylan Plummer, a grassroots organizer for Cascadia Wildlands, one of the groups that filed suit to stop the sale last year. ""What Seneca and the BLM are doing in the backyard of Springfield is just totally objectionable. We’re here organizing with community members, with climate organizations and with forest defenders to say no more, enough is enough.""

Stephen Maturen / Getty Images Portlanders are organizing their response to the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died Monday after Officer Derek Chauvin, a white man, kneeled on his neck for more than five minutes, blocking his airway. Floyd was in handcuffs at the time, as he had just been arrested for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill. While Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey fired Chauvin and the three other officers involved in the incident, Floyd's death inspired immediate protests by Minneapolis residents angered by the seemingly constant cycle of Black men dying at the hands of police officers across the US. On both Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, Minneapolis police responded to the protesters with tear gas and munitions, quickly escalating the largely peaceful demonstrations. The ensuing chaos dissolved into widespread looting and arson Wednesday evening. On Friday, two Portland organizations will hold events to memorialize Floyd and protest the police violence that led to—and followed—Floyd's death. Here's what you need to know about each: Portland NAACP's Eulogy for Black America Friday, May 29, 11:30 am Terry Schrunk Plaza, 1200 SW Third Portland NAACP will host a demonstration honoring recent victims of police brutality, including Floyd, and ""calling on well-intentioned Americans everywhere to take a stand."" The event will be led by NAACP President Reverend E.D. Mondainé, City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, Urban League of Portland CEO Nkenge Harmon Johnson, Coalition of Communities of Color Director Marcus Mundy, and several other local religious leaders. Attendees have been asked to wear face masks and gloves, and observe social distancing. The event will also be livestreamed on the NAACP's Facebook page. From the press release: ""For the wider public, the reality of police brutality can seem an inconvenient truth. Black suffering at the hands of police may be dismissed as a result of culture or a failure to follow police instructions. The reality is that Black people continue to be unfairly cast as an outsized threat, and Black bodies are all too often seen as disposable. In a just nation, all citizens must be afforded the same protections under the law. America will have to earn the trust of the Black community if we are to move forward together. This starts with a painful but necessary reflection on the pattern of beliefs and behaviors that lead to tragedies like the death of George Floyd.""

(KOIN) — The violent protests in Minneapolis over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer kneeled on his neck, spread to other cities. In Portland, the NAACP is planning a “Eulogy for Black America” at 11:30 a.m. Friday at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown. The event will include a number of dignitaries, including Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty. A Reddit thread announced a vigil for George Floyd to begin at 6 p.m. Friday at Peninsula Park. However, some people took to the streets of Downtown Portland on Thursday evening to protest police brutality. Between 70-80 people gathered on the steps of the Multnomah County Justice Center (some of whom had been there since the previous night) and, later, marched north up SW 3rd Avenue. One demonstrator — Adrian Echols — said, “Police shootings and police killings of American Americans like myself, this isn’t new. It’s just everyone just has iPhones now so it’s getting recorded.” “I can’t breathe !“ yells the crowd as they go back towards the Justice Center. #koin6news pic.twitter.com/rqXihXa8c3 — Matt Rashleigh (@Matt_KOIN) May 29, 2020 Portland police prepare Following some prepared remarks, PPB Acting Chief Chris Davis answered a variety of questions about protests in general and how the bureau is planning for the expected protests Friday. “We prepare for these the same way we prepare every time we have a protest in Portland,” Davis said, and that includes learning as much about the groups holding the protest in advance. But protests take on a completely different dynamic “when the protest is about the police,” he said. During the pandemic, he said, it’s not the police’s place to do strict enforcement of social distancing. Davis noted he saw protest organizers in Minneapolis trying to enforce social distancing for safety and said that’s the more appropriate way to go. When preparing for a protest, “we never start with the assumption that there will be criminal activity.” But he noted it’s a “very delicate balance” in policing these events. The Portland Police Chief responded to George Floyd’s death in MN by saying: “The actions & tactics displayed on the video do not represent our profession's values and are contrary to our fundamental duty to protect and serve."" #koin6news #Portland #Oregon #pdx #OR #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/9xOqoZSCdF — Jennifer Dowling (@JenDowlingKoin6) May 29, 2020 “There’s been a trend over the last couple of years where opposing factions face off,” he said. In situations where groups are at odds, the police have to maintain public safety. “If you’re coming here to hurt other people or damage property, we can’t have that.” Pelosi on George Floyd death: ‘We saw a murder’ There are about 300 protest actions in the city of Portland each year, and most of them require very little action by police beyond directing traffic. “We support people’s First Amendment rights,” he said, “but ask that people do so in a way that does not impact other people’s rights.” Watch the PPB’s full teleconference below: Law enforcement agencies from around the Portland metro area released a joint statement on Thursday. The following statement was signed by the Tualatin, Tigard, Sherwood and Forest police departments, the Portland Police Bureau, the Portland of Portland Police Department and the Clackamas, Washington and Multnomah county sheriff’s offices: “We stand together as law enforcement professionals in the Portland Metropolitan Area to condemn the tactics and actions demonstrated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is our job to protect life and increase public safety within our communities. The incident in Minneapolis does not reflect our value of the sanctity of life or the code of ethics we have sworn to uphold. It is disheartening when the actions of so few tarnish the noble profession that we have dedicated our lives to. We are committed to maintaining and strengthening the trust of our communities who grant us the privilege to serve them.” In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade.

YouTube / Portland Police Bureau Portland Deputy Chief Chris Davis addressed the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers—and the ensuing protests—during a press call Thursday afternoon. ""What we see in this in this video from Minneapolis does not represent the values or standards of our profession,"" said Davis. ""What we see... represents a big step in the wrong direction."" Davis is referring to a cell phone video that captures Floyd's last moments on Monday, May 25. In the video, Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin is seen kneeling on top of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, who is lying on the street in handcuffs. Chauvin presses his knee on Floyd's neck for seven minutes, blocking his airway, as Floyd says ""I can't breathe."" Floyd, who had been arrested for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit bill at a grocery store, lost consciousness before Chauvin released him. Floyd was pronounced dead after an ambulance took him to a hospital. Davis said the the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) has received several calls since Floyd's death asking about the bureau's own training and policies around use-of-force. ""For me to sit here today and spell out all the things we’ve done in Portland to avoid an outcome like the one that we saw in this case, in some way misses the point,"" Davis said. ""We just need to be real about the fact that, in our profession, we have a problem with our relationship with communities... particularly marginalized communities, communities of color."" Davis commended the decision of Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and Mayor Jacob Frey to fire Chauvin and three other officers involved in the incident. Davis did not, however, comment on the actions Minneapolis officers have taken to address protests that have resulted from Floyd's death. Officers have fired munitions and tear gas at crowds of protesters that gathered Tuesday and Wednesday to demand a criminal investigation into Floyd's death. The escalating violence dissolved into widespread looting and arson Wednesday evening. ""Without more specific information about reasoning, it wouldn’t be fair for me to weigh in on their tactics,"" said Davis. ""But... what we're seeing happening is not good."" Davis said PPB officers are prepared to respond to any local protests in response to Floyd's death, but only if the events spur criminal activity. Two demonstrations against police violence have been scheduled for Friday in Portland. ""Policing protests takes on a new dimension when the protest is about the police,"" Davis said. ""In general, we try not to be involved in those, unless we have to... because we recognize that the visual presence of police officers could be triggering for people."" Davis asked that all protesters follow social distancing guidelines during the scheduled events. He said PPB isn't planning on enforcing those guidelines during the protests.",0.0
1619575972,2020-05-28 09:34:34,China's NPC formally approves proposal for Hong Kong national security law,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/world-news/chinas-npc-formally-approves-proposal-for-hong-kong-national.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"danielvfung/iStockBy KARSON YIU, ABC News  (HONG KONG) -- China’s National People’s Congress endorsed with thunderous applause a controversial new law to ban all “activities” in Hong Kong that endanger China’s national security at the closing session of its annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing Thursday.  The yet to be drafted law will ultimately be enacted in Hong Kong by decree, bypassing the local lawmaking process, where the Asian financial center is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy from Beijing under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement put in place when the former British colony was handed back to China.  For the past year, Hong Kong has been rocked with protests that became increasingly violent and anti-Beijing toward the end of 2019. While the COVID-19 pandemic has kept the unrest largely off the streets until recently, Beijing has signaled that it has lost all patience for dissent in the city.  In introducing the proposal to a vote, the preamble reads, “In recent years, the national security risks of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have become prominent, and various illegal activities such as 'Hong Kong independence,' splitting the country, and violent terrorist activities have seriously endangered the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the country.”  The proposal for the law was approved in China’s rubber-stamp parliament 2,878 votes to one, just hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong was ""no longer autonomous from China"" setting in place the possibility of ending the special treatment the trading hub had enjoyed under U.S. law.  Over 1,300 American companies have offices in Hong Kong and the city is home to roughly 85,000 American citizens. Despite having been largely spared the direct impacts of the U.S.-China trade war, the city has been increasingly caught in between Beijing and Washington as their relationship continues to crater in the wake of the pandemic.  There is no actual law yet and the language of the proposal remains broad, but Hong Kong residents and even the Hong Kong government will have little say in the process. The city only has a sole delegate, Tam Yiu-chung, in China’s top lawmaker body, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which is expected to convene in June to hash out the specific language of the law and approve it.  On the sidelines of the meetings this past week, Tam has tried to reassure Hong Kong residents, telling them they can express their views to the NPC via an online platform. It is unclear whether those views will be fully taken into account as Beijing has signaled it wants to fast track the law. Observers believe the law will likely be in place sometime over the summer ahead of the Hong Kong legislative elections in September, where the pro-democracy camp is hoping for a big win.  Since the announcement, Beijing and its proxies have been trying to reassure Hong Kong residents that the law will only affect a small targeted portion of Hong Kong. Yet over the past week alone, the language of the proposal was expanded in scope to include groups and organizations in addition to individuals who engaged in acts and activities of sedition, secession and foreign interference.  Issues that will need to be clarified are whether those charged with the new law will be tried in Hong Kong or the mainland and whether local judges with foreign passports would be able to preside over cases.  There is another hotly debated provision in the proposal that allows mainland Chinese security agents to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time. Hong Kong maintains a separate legal system to the mainland, so will these security agents adhere to locals laws?  Hong Kong legal scholar Johannes Chan told Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) Thursday that it would be naive to believe that proposed law would only affect “a small group of people.”  “In China they never really define what exactly is 'national security,’"" Chan said in the interview. “So the law could change according to political expediency or political necessity.”  The proposed law has brought street protests back onto the streets of Hong Kong in recent days but they have been met with heavy police presence. Hong Kong Police arrested over 300 protestors across the city on Wednesday.  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved",0.0

But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. 'I feel very, very badly,"" Trump said Thursday of George Floyd's death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. ""That's a very shocking sight.' Once more likely to hew to the 'blue lives matter' mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer's conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations. 'This is the first race-tinged case that I've ever heard him address' as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. 'So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it's empty words because it is so out of character.' White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously. 'This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President's unwavering support for the African-American community,' Deere said, citing Trump's support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities. Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. 'This is something that is a local matter and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,' then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner's dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: 'You have people on both sides of that.' Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump's tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. 'You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,"" he told reporters this month. ""It's a heartbreaking thing.' The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: 'it could be something that we didn't see on tape."" Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn't breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump 'was very upset when he saw that video,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. 'He wants justice to be served.' Trump's conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is ""a big supporter of law enforcement,"" but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: 'The lack of training here is breathtaking.' 'It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,' echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump. 'We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,' said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a 'terrorist group,' said Thursday that Floyd's death was totally 'unjustified' and he was 'so mad.' The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black,' a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation's first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans' response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. 'Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it's just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,"" he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd's death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. 'It's like a father that misses a kid's graduation of high school, graduation of college,"" he said. 'He can't be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he's there when he graduates with his Ph.D."" ___ Associated Press writer Kat Stafford in Detroit contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in the National Guard on Thursday as looting broke out in St. Paul and a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence after rioting over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man in police custody, reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles. The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices in downtown Minneapolis. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs closed early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service out of safety concerns. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to a Target in St. Paul’s Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting then shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said. By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police’s 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night’s protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. The next day, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country. The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, 'in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can't breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard tweeted that a 'key objective' was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was 'here with the Minneapolis Fire Department' to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. A department spokesman didn't immediately respond to a phone call. Fire Chief John Fruetel told CNN that the department couldn't get to the scene for safety reasons. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. 'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,' tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at 'every single protest' since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. 'We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,' she said. 'We just want the police officer to be held accountable.' Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,' Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. 'WHY US?' demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. 'We're burning our own neighborhood,' said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. 'This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.' No officers could be seen beyond the station. 'What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,' Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,' said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. 'They're making money off of us,' he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. 'I didn't break anything.' The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. 'If the strategy was to keep residents safe "" it failed,' City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. 'Prevent property damage "" it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. 'Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don't want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,' he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was 'under the influence of something,' the caller said: 'Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.' Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting 'a robust criminal investigation' into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

That hasn’t been said nearly enough over these awful last few months. In this frightening and uncertain time, we’ve had to absorb many new and disconcerting concepts — from social distancing to flattening the curve to community transmission to case-fatality rates. We’ve been reminded repeatedly that we aren’t doing enough to stem the spread of the coronavirus, that we are a “failed state,” unable to manage the greatest existential threat in our lifetimes. The country that calls itself exceptional has long lines at food banks, strained public health systems and millions of its own citizens wondering how they’re going to keep the lights on and their families fed. There is no question that misinformation, mismanagement and incompetence from national, state and local leaders have cost many lives. But focusing only on failure obscures much of the good work that the vast majority of Americans have done, and are doing, to look after one another. Consider that over the first six weeks of the crisis, nearly 44% of U.S. residents — roughly 144 million people — mostly stayed home, enduring inconvenience and isolation for the health and safety of not only family members, friends and neighbors, but of people they’ve never met. We keep our physical distance from one another wherever possible, even when it is awkward and tiresome and runs against our most primal instincts as social mammals. In the absence of any concerts, sporting events or other organized group entertainment, we’ve come up with creative ways to entertain ourselves and one another. The creative flourishing of people forced to carry on online from the intimacy of their own homes is something to behold. Some Americans who didn’t need their stimulus payments donated their stimulus checks to those in greater need. This is love of country at its best, generous and communal. And it’s all the more important to keep that spirit alive as we enter the warmer months and are tempted to forget all that we have learned in this dark and deadly spring. That’s where a little encouragement from our leaders would come in handy. It could sound something like this: You’re doing great, my fellow Americans. What you have been asked to do is not easy, but you’re doing it. And you’ve already made a big difference. People are alive today who might otherwise not be, thanks to the sacrifices you have made and are continuing to make. Thanks to you, the situation is improving in many of the most hard-hit places. Thanks to you, cities and towns around the country are starting the slow process of safely reopening for business. The road to normalcy will be long and difficult, and it is one we’ll travel together. Of course, there are millions of people who never had the luxury to stay home or socially distance: the front-line workers — from doctors and nurses to grocery-store employees and mail carriers — who have kept everyone else cared for and fed throughout this pandemic. They deserve the nation’s enduring gratitude. They also deserve higher pay, better working conditions, stronger safety measures and, in many cases, all of the above. So much remains unknown about this terrible disease: why it kills some and barely grazes others; why it hits different countries differently; how it will develop over the coming months and years. What is known is that there will be more spikes of infections, that many more people will get sick and die, and that we will be constantly working to keep people healthy while also keeping the economy running. We also know that our own decisions, as individuals, will be vital in helping to protect our neighbors. The most patriotic thing that Americans can do right now is not to carry military-style rifles to a protest that shuts down their state legislature, or to spread baseless conspiracy theories online, or to pick fights in a supermarket over reasonable public health measures. The best way to serve the nation is to do the things that we know work, and to help each other out when we fall short. That’s how we protect the most vulnerable among us, restore our economy and reinvigorate the promises at the heart of the American ideal.",0.0

The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported, sharing photographs of what appeared to be smashed windows at the statehouse. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from The Associated Press weren't returned overnight. 'I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus.

Earlier Thursday, video showed the crowd marching down Broad Street and blocking High Street, two downtown arteries near the statehouse. As they marched, protesters engaged in a call-and-response chant: 'Say his name,"" followed by 'George Floyd.' Demonstrators also chanted, 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.'

Photographs from the Dispatch showed a smashed storefront at the Einstein Bros. Bagels shop across the street from the statehouse.

Twitter adds ‘glorifying violence’ warning",https://www.koin.com/news/trump-tweets-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-twitter-adds-glorifying-violence-warning/,en,True,,1406,koin cbs,http://www.koinlocal6.com/default.aspx,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — drawing another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric. Trump tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. Earlier Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.” It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. Trump’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis on Thursday night. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Twitter added a warning to Trump’s tweet about the Minneapolis protests, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Earlier this week, it applied fact checks to two of his tweets about mail-in ballots. Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento, California, police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. Trump has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online, and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.” Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement” but expressed outrage Wednesday, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”",0.0

(KOIN) — A young man was arrested as protests over the death of George Floyd led to tense moments between police and protesters in downtown Portland overnight. As Portland Police Bureau officers arrived in riot gear, some protesters blocked streets around the Multnomah County Justice Center around 3 a.m. on Friday morning. About Between 70-80 people were already gathered on the steps of the building on Thursday evening and, later, marched north up SW 3rd Avenue. Oliver Rodriguez was arrested during the protests in downtown Portland. (Courtesy: PPB) Twenty-year-old Oliver Rodriguez was arrested overnight and charged with interfering with a police officer along with resisting arrest. “PPB monitored the demonstration overnight for several hours. Some streets were blocked, but there was minimal traffic and very little impact,” said Lieutenant Tina Jones in an email to KOIN 6. “We managed this event like we do hundreds throughout a given year, by assessing the situation and determining if there are dangers to life or property and if intervention is necessary.” George Floyd’s death sparks Portland demonstrations One demonstrator — Adrian Echols — said, “Police shootings and police killings of American Americans like myself, this isn’t new. It’s just everyone just has iPhones now so it’s getting recorded.” Although the protests in Portland were tense, they have not turned violent. They were protesting the death of 46-year-old George Floyd who died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer held his knee on his neck for several minutes. The four police officers have been fired, including Derek Chauvin, the officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness. On Friday morning, President Trump tweeted saying protesters in Minneapolis were “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Earlier on Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death. “That’s a very shocking sight,” he said. More protests coming The NAACP is planning a “Eulogy for Black America” at 11:30 a.m. Friday at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown. The event will include a number of dignitaries, including Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty. A Reddit thread announced a vigil for George Floyd to begin at 6 p.m. Friday at Peninsula Park. Portland police prepare Following some prepared remarks, PPB Acting Chief Chris Davis answered a variety of questions about protests in general and how the bureau is planning for the expected protests Friday. “We prepare for these the same way we prepare every time we have a protest in Portland,” Davis said, and that includes learning as much about the groups holding the protest in advance. But protests take on a completely different dynamic “when the protest is about the police,” he said. During the pandemic, he said, it’s not the police’s place to do strict enforcement of social distancing. Davis noted he saw protest organizers in Minneapolis trying to enforce social distancing for safety and said that’s the more appropriate way to go. When preparing for a protest, “we never start with the assumption that there will be criminal activity.” But he noted it’s a “very delicate balance” in policing these events.",0.0

Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard 'to protect people & property in Atlanta.' Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy 'immediately' to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: 'He said I can't breathe. Justice for George.' They chanted ''No justice, no peace' and 'Say his name. George Floyd.' After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting 'Quit your jobs.' At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: 'This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.' 'You are disgracing our city,' she told protesters. 'You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.' Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. 'We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?' he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. 'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. 'Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this.' The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. 'It's my duty to be out here,' said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard.' In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. 'My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed.' Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops' graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote 'killer' on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. 'It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,' he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death 'are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.'",0.0

1620230750,2020-05-29 12:00:00,Portland Plans Vigil Events In Solidarity With Minneapolis And George Floyd,https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-oregon-vigil-events-solidarity-minneapolis-george-floyd/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (10:42 p.m. PT) — Protests and demonstrations have rattled Minnesota following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer put his knee into Floyd’s neck for eight minutes during an arrest. The arrest was captured on camera. Reactions to Floyd’s death have reverberated across the country, including in Oregon. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Multiple vigils took place Friday in the Portland area, as participants asked people to stand in solidarity with Floyd and other black people affected by police violence, brutality and killings. The Portland chapter of the NAACP held “A Eulogy For Black America” at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown Portland. The event was also livestreamed on the group’s Facebook page. A number of prominent leaders from the Portland black community spoke, as did two rabbis. Portland poet Emmet Wheatfall opened the ceremony with a piece he wrote called “An Elegy For George Floyd.” “In a nation striped and cloaked in red, white, and blue,” Wheatfall recited, “George’s life was snuffed out by a white cop wearing his dress duty blue.” In an interview before the event, Wheatfall said that enough is enough. “George Floyd is an example of the tradition of destroying the black body in America. It continues and it must stop,” he said. Jonathan Levinson/OPB The event was as much a memorial for Floyd and so many other black Americans who have been killed in racist attacks as it was a call to action for the white community. “Black people are exhausted by racism,” said Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, as she stood in front of large photos of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Michael Brown. “And what I need today is a commitment from people that don’t look like me, that they will demand that black lives matter.” The NAACP Portland chapter’s president, Reverend E.D. Mondainé, closed out the event with an impassioned plea to the white community. “You’re going to have to talk to your aunts and uncles at the dinner table,” he implored. “You’re gonna have to talk to those people that are hard to talk to. You’re gonna have to tell them that you’re racist. And you’re gonna have to do something better. We expect you to do better. We command that you do better. And we know that you can do better.” Jonathan Levinson/OPB The PNW Youth Liberation Front also hosted a vigil at Peninsula Park, which drew huge crowds of demonstrators to North Portland. Many wore masks and spaced out in the large city park. Protesters marched south on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard toward the Justice Center downtown following the event. Out of the large crowd of marchers, a small group broke windows and entered the Justice Center. Around 11 p.m., a fire broke out inside the building. Police ordered people to disperse and deployed tear gas. Shortly after the fire started, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler urged protesters to remain peaceful. “Portland, this is NOT us. When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd? Protest, speak truth, but don’t tear your city apart in the process,” Wheeler wrote in a tweet. Claudia Meza/OPB Portland metro area law enforcement agencies released a joint statement Thursday, condemning the “tactics and actions demonstrated in Minneapolis.” “It is our job to protect life and increase public safety within our communities,” the statement said. “The incident in Minneapolis does not reflect our value of the sanctity of life or the code of ethics we have sworn to uphold. It is disheartening when the actions of so few tarnish the noble profession that we have dedicated our lives to. We are committed to maintaining and strengthening the trust of our communities who grant us the privilege to serve them.” The statement was signed by law enforcement leaders from agencies including sheriffs’ offices for Washington, Clackamas and Multnomah counties, the Portland Police Bureau and others. Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch also sent out a separate statement Thursday. The tactics used by the Minneapolis officers “do not represent our profession’s values and our contrary to our fundamental duty to protect and serve,” she wrote. Resch said the bureau is reaching out to its community partners and collaborating with its equity team to engage in conversations and strengthen relationships. “This incident strengthens our resolve to work even harder to earn the trust of our community, especially with persons of color,” Resch said in the statement. Other community leaders have also weighed in on Floyd’s death. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued a statement Friday, stating he stands in solidarity with people grieving Floyd. “I have spent time this week reflecting on and mourning the murder of Mr. Floyd and what we continue to witness around this nation,” Wheeler said in the statement. “Anti-black racism is what compelled an officer to suffocate an unarmed black man, ignoring him while he pleaded for his life, saying he couldn’t breathe, and then crying out for his mother as he suffered.” Wheeler urged the city to come together to “work toward healing our communities that have had to live through systemic racism and losing their daughters and sons too early. We have to do better.” “Enough is enough. Portland, let’s move forward together, and not one step back. We will rise through this stronger together,” Wheeler wrote. Portland Public Schools Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero issued a statement Thursday that reflected on black people who have been killed in acts of “racist violence,” including Floyd; Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot and killed in February while jogging; and Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in 2014. “As we go into the weekend, I will remember their names and reflect on how we can proactively create the conditions so that every black student at PPS is seen, heard and supported,” Guerrero said in the statement. Guerrero continued: “We cannot remain neutral about racism. We are ready to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with our community in the fight against anti-Black racism.”",0.0

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

As Portland Police Bureau officers arrived in riot gear, some protesters blocked streets around the Multnomah County Justice Center around 3 a.m. on Friday morning. About Between 70-80 people were already gathered on the steps of the building on Thursday evening and, later, marched north up SW 3rd Avenue. Twenty-year-old Oliver Rodriguez was arrested overnight and charged with interfering with a police officer along with resisting arrest. ""PPB monitored the demonstration overnight for several hours. Some streets were blocked, but there was minimal traffic and very little impact,"" said Lieutenant Tina Jones in an email to KOIN 6 News. ""We managed this event like we do hundreds throughout a given year, by assessing the situation and determining if there are dangers to life or property and if intervention is necessary."" One demonstrator — Adrian Echols — said, ""Police shootings and police killings of American Americans like myself, this isn't new. It's just everyone just has iPhones now so it's getting recorded."" Although the protests in Portland were tense, they have not turned violent. They were protesting the death of 46-year-old George Floyd who died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer held his knee on his neck for several minutes. The four police officers have been fired, including Derek Chauvin, the officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck until he lost consciousness. On Friday morning, President Trump tweeted saying protesters in Minneapolis were ""thugs"" and said that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Earlier on Thursday, Trump said, ""I feel very, very badly"" about George Floyd's death. ""That's a very shocking sight,"" he said. More protests coming The NAACP is planning a ""Eulogy for Black America"" at 11:30 a.m. Friday at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown. The event will include a number of dignitaries, including Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty. A Reddit thread announced a vigil for George Floyd to begin at 6 p.m. Friday at Peninsula Park. Portland police prepare Following some prepared remarks, PPB Acting Chief Chris Davis answered a variety of questions about protests in general and how the bureau is planning for the expected protests Friday. ""We prepare for these the same way we prepare every time we have a protest in Portland,"" Davis said, and that includes learning as much about the groups holding the protest in advance. But protests take on a completely different dynamic ""when the protest is about the police,"" he said. During the pandemic, he said, it's not the police's place to do strict enforcement of social distancing. Davis noted he saw protest organizers in Minneapolis trying to enforce social distancing for safety and said that's the more appropriate way to go. When preparing for a protest, ""we never start with the assumption that there will be criminal activity."" But he noted it's a ""very delicate balance"" in policing these events.

1620294506,2020-05-29 11:59:32,Governor acknowledges 'abject failure' in protest response,https://www.registerguard.com/zz/news/20200529/governor-acknowledges-abject-failure-in-protest-response?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"MINNEAPOLIS — With smoke drifting over Minneapolis, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other 'twin' because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd's back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey's order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he's 'confident justice will be served' after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd's death were 'harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.' The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr's comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges 'must be, and will be, based on the law and facts' and that the process is 'proceeding quickly.' He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are 'absolutely outlandish.' Selwyn Jones' nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd's death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. 'I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,' Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. 'I don't think the point that they're trying to make is the point that we're trying to make.' Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are 'taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.' ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden's comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called 'an open wound' on American society, for Floyd's death. He says it's time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, 'No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.' ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of 'I can't breathe' in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders' shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia's Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man's neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, 'This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the 'law enforcement officers' in the United States."" The ministry called on the U.S. to 'to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies."" ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the 'abject failure' of the response to this week's protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd's death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz's comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd's death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones 'brought this upon themselves.' They cited an initial report in Floyd's case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club's former owner says it's not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades. Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press that George Floyd had worked there only more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music. Santamaria says she doesn't believe the two knew each other before their encounter Monday night when the officer was seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck. Santamaria says that if the officer had recognized Floyd, 'He might have given him a little more mercy.' Santamaria sold the venue within the past two months. She says Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but didn't like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup. She says a half dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified 'overkill. ___ 7 a.m. Thick smoke is hovering over Minneapolis after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned. The fire came during a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. The focus of many of the protests has been the 3rd Precinct station. A spokesman says police abandoned it late Thursday to protect employees.

Observing the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky., and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, local organizer Madeliene Smith called out the Eugene-Springfield community for not ""showing up"" for black lives and created the protest, which will be held at 1 p.m. Sunday at the federal courthouse, at East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street in downtown Eugene. ""Eugene has a growing population of people of color who are all too familiar with living in fear of police,"" said Smith in a release announcing the protest. She also believes it is naive when people, especially white people, believe such acts of brutality couldn’t happen here. The rally at the courthouse building will start with remarks from local NAACP President Eric Richardson, then protesters will make their way across the MLK bridge, and pass by the Eugene Police Department in nonviolent protest, on the way to Alton Baker Park. All participants are being asked to wear masks (extras will be available) and maintain social distancing protocols throughout the event. ""Many of us watched in disbelief as we witnessed the police interaction with George Floyd, which led to his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers,"" Eugene Police Department Chief Chris Skinner said in response to Floyd’s death. ""Events like these transcend the thousands of miles where they occur and resonate deeply with our communities of color here in Eugene. We know that we have a long way to go and fully realize that events on a national level erode the faith and trust in your police department here at home. We are committed to being better,"" Skinner said. The march will end at Alton Baker Park, where there will be speakers including Oregon state Sen. James Manning of Oregon’s 7th District, starting at approximately 2 p.m. An ASL interpreter will be present.

(KOIN) — Chaos reigned in downtown Portland late Friday night into the early morning hours of Saturday as a protest against police violence after a handcuffed black man was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck descended into a riot. Vandalism, break-ins, looting and fires were witnessed by KOIN 6 News crews into the overnight hours as thousands roamed the streets, either partaking in the riot or watching it unfold around them. Multiple high-end retailers, including storefronts for Apple, Louis Vuitton and Tory Burch, were breached and looted. A Chase Bank branch was broken into and set on fire. At least two protesters were arrested according to Portland police; no other details were immediately released. As a peaceful vigil in North Portland turned into a march through Northeast neighborhoods Friday evening, protesters had been gathered outside of the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. After the groups merged sometime around 10:30 p.m., KOIN 6 News crews witnessed protesters smashing the windows of the Justice Center. “Flares and other incendiary devices” were thrown on the first level of the building as Corrections Records staff were still there, according to officials; staffers were able to escape to a secure location inside the building. The flames were put out by the building’s fire sprinkler system; however, extensive damaged remained. In an interview with KOIN 6 News, City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty condemned the riot, saying the destruction of property has nothing to do with supporting black people. “Destroying the city, and for what?” she said. Demonstrators had been gathered to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man whose death in police custody had been caught on camera. The white officer who kneeled on his neck has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Firefighters extinguish a fire set to a car in downtown Portland, May 29, 2020. (KOIN) Portland police tweeted just after midnight that SW Naito Parkway west to SW 13th Avenue was closed from SW Lincoln north to NW Everett Street. Officers threatened those in that area with tear gas, projectiles and other non-lethal tactics, calling it “illegal assembly.” By 1:30 a.m., crowds were significantly smaller than they had been hours before; however, KOIN 6 News witnessed the smaller crowds continue the destruction. The vigil at Peninsula Park started around 6 p.m., which eventually turned into a march down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Eventually, protesters crossed the Willamette River on the Burnside Bridge to meet with other protesters outside of the Justice Center. Flames were seen inside the Justice Center building and smoke was pouring from the windows at about 11 p.m. Officers in tactical gear arrived a short time later. Protesters threw objects at officers. Portland police tweeted that firefighters responded to the scene. By 11:15 p.m., officers started using flash bangs in an attempt to disperse crowds. A crowd broke into Pioneer Place and dozens left carrying merchandise from stores inside at about 11:30 p.m. Around the same time, protesters set a large fire in the street at 4th and Main. Officers said one person was shot, treated and released prior to the protest. One person was arrested earlier in the afternoon. The Portland Police Bureau said it was investigating three separate shootings on Friday night, including one tied to the protest. Police did not elaborate. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who was out of town when the protests began to be with his ailing mother, took to Twitter to condemn the riot. At 1 a.m. on Saturday, protesters set fire inside a Chase bank at SW 6th Avenue and Yamhill. Earlier in the evening at the vigil, several speakers called on others to stand against racism. At one point, the group observed a moment of silence to remember all those who have been killed. “If all lives matter, we wouldn’t be in this boat right now,” one speaker said into the bullhorn.

If you are afraid, don’t put on the uniform.” Dozens of people also attended Portland NAACP’s “Eulogy for Black America” Friday morning, which was held at Terry Schrunk Plaza. Black and religious leaders shared feelings of hope and outrage over Floyd’s death. They said black Americans are tired of racism and the community needs to work together to be part of the solution. “Black people are exhausted by racism. Black people have been fighting this,” Hardesty, who had attended this rally, said earlier Friday. Hardesty accused the “majority community” of being chronically silent after other past killings of black people. “It would be easy for us to say this is a police problem but I want to tell you it’s not a police problem,” she said. “Police is a weapon, a tool that continues to be used to sacrifice black lives. But that would be wrong. The reality is that white America has accepted the fact black and brown bodies are expendable. You’ve been silenced.” Following the eulogy, a group of people laid on the ground outside of the Multnomah County Justice Center to symbolically call for an end to police violence. Many in the group had been demonstrating near the steps of the building since Thursday. .@PortlandPolice just showed up.

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

'The cop who killed George Floyd,' Facebook and Twitter users claimed, wrongly identifying a man pictured laughing alongside President Donald Trump at a rally as former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. More fake videos and photos followed as the demonstrations turned violent the next day. Some speculated, without evidence, that Floyd's death was staged or that protesters had been paid to stir up trouble, in tweets collectively shared thousands of times. Others said a video showed a protester driving a car through a shopping complex in Minneapolis, when in fact the footage was taken during an incident at an Illinois mall last year. Since a video of an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck first surfaced, internet troublemakers and even celebrities have posted misleading or unsubstantiated claims around his death and the ensuing protests. The social media inaccuracies have created confusion around the unfolding news, tearing at the already loosely woven seams of America's racial tapestry. 'A good deal of this, if not all of this, is intentionally trying to stoke the racial flame that has been ablaze in the United States almost since slavery started 400-plus years ago,' said Lanier Holt, a communications professor at Ohio State University who studied in Minneapolis. While the falsehoods may have been unwittingly amplified by some, they have likely been planted by those preying on existing racial tensions, Holt said. 'They put out that false information to get that narrative in the minds of people who already have these ... pre-existing biases,' he said. The online misinformation so far appears to have fallen along those racial divides. The day after Floyd died, Twitter and Facebook users shared a photo of a man wearing a 'Make America White Again' red cap, claiming it was Chauvin, who was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. A version of the image was actually first posted online by a pro-Trump internet trickster who has previously duped media outlets into writing fictitious stories. Jonathan Riches confirmed to The Associated Press through messages that he was the man in the photo. Twitter later labeled rapper and actor Ice Cube's tweet with the photo as 'manipulated media.' After protests on Thursday night, the St. Paul Police Department denied rumors trending online that one of its police officers was responsible for breaking windows of an AutoZone store in neighboring Minneapolis. 'We know with precision where that officer has been and who that officer has been with,' St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders said. 'He was at work, and not at the location.' Meanwhile, others have posted old or out-of-context photos online and falsely suggested it showed the damage caused by Minnesota protesters. Hundreds of thousands viewed a short video clip circulating online that purported to show a car driving through the Mall of America, the massive shopping complex that sits in a Minneapolis suburb. 'RIP to Mall of America,' one Twitter user wrote. Fact checkers debunked the video, but as of Friday afternoon, people on Facebook and Twitter continued to say that the mall had been looted by protesters. Facebook declined to comment Friday on misinformation on their platform around Floyd's death or the protests. Divisive misinformation around Floyd's death and the resulting protests thrives online because social media users choose who they do "" or don't "" follow and are less likely to be exposed to differing viewpoints outside of their circle of pages, family and friends. 'We thought social media was going to be this great equalizer,' Holt said. 'People find networks of people who are just like them. If they don't actually have literal black friends, this reinforces all the stereotypes that were fed to them.' ___ Associated Press writers David Klepper in Rhode Island, Ali Swenson in Phoenix and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this story.",0.0

Floyd, a black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. On Friday, President Trump spoke with Floyd's family, saying he understood their pain. That call came several hours after his tweet about about rioters in Minneapolis sparked outrage, and drew a warning label from Twitter. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. The protesters have moved from the White House to another part of the city. Multiple reporters posted that they were inside the White House and that the Secret Service was not letting them leave the grounds during the lockdown. The Secret Service frequently locks down the White House for perceived security threats, such as packages or bags left nearby. But the building is rarely locked down for protests. And while protests are a daily occurrence outside the White House, they are often small – drawing a few dozen people, at most. While the largest protests have enveloped Minneapolis, prompting the deployment of 500 National Guardsmen, people have taken to the streets from New York to Chicago to the California coast. Seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville on Thursday night, dozens were arrested in New York City, officers fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters in Phoenix and a driver appeared to intentionally run over a protester in Denver. The Secret Service said that their ""personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration in Lafayette Park. In the interest of public safety we encourage all to remain peaceful.""

1620589979,2020-05-29 18:43:18,Protesters fill Portland streets after Minneapolis police killing,https://www.centralmaine.com/2020/05/29/portland-police-chief-speaks-out-about-minneapolis-police-killing/,en,False,,658832,State News - United States - Oregon,http://www.oregon.statenews.net/,"Hundreds of people marched through Portland on Friday to protest police violence against people of color, in one of many demonstrations around the nation following the death of a black man who was detained by police in Minneapolis on Monday. George Floyd, 46, died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begged for breath before he lost consciousness. When paramedics arrived, he had no pulse and was unresponsive. Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday, but not before outraged residents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul demonstrated through the night, plunging the cities into unrest and chaos. The protests have spread across the nation, with groups taking to the streets from New York to California and Colorado to Florida to Atlanta. Some of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but others have led to vandalism and confrontations with police. In Portland, two groups marched peacefully through the city with dozens of police in tow blocking traffic and clearing a path for the demonstrators. The first group assembled after 3 p.m. before City Hall, marched to the Portland police station on Middle Street, and then to Monument Square before dispersing without incident around 5 p.m. Simultaneously, another group of demonstrators blocked Franklin Street near Whole Foods for about an hour before moving to the intersection of Congress Street and High Street, shutting down what is typically one of the city’s busiest intersections. Demonstrators dispersed by about 8 p.m., and there were no signs of violence or arrests. In 2016, Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched through Portland after two black men were shot and killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. That protest generated more than a dozen arrests, but no one was arrested during the demonstrations on Friday, and police cleared traffic and stood by as demonstrators hurled insults at them and chanted profanities. One of the demonstrators who attended the Monument Square rally, Raymond Diamond, 24, carried a white sign painted in flowing black letters that asked, “could it have been me?” Diamond said he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a history of slavery, racism and oppression began before the nation’s independence and continues in subtler forms today. Although Diamond said he senses less racial tension overall in Maine, he fears he could one day be the victim of police violence simply for being black. His fear of police began when he was about 14 or 15, when Diamond watched from the passenger seat as a police officer pulled over his mother in their own neighborhood, eventually making the traffic stop in their own driveway, he said. Someone must have thought they didn’t belong there, Diamond recalled. He still remembers his mother’s anger, and her warning to him afterward. “She told me to be careful and to protect myself and to do what I had to do to come home, so she isn’t one of those mothers crying on the news,” he said. “With a history like what we have, I’m not surprised this is where we are. The police are a reflection of the state. That’s not something that we can get around.” Ahead of the local demonstrations in Portland, the Portland police chief and leaders of two labor unions representing officers released a letter to the community to say they were disturbed by Floyd’s death and the way his arrest was handled. But the local police leaders – who collectively have several decades of policing experience – did not say in the written statement released Friday whether they believe the officer should face criminal prosecution. Some police leaders around the country condemned the death as nothing short of murder, and by midday Friday, Chauvin was charged by a local prosecutor and taken into custody. He faces one count of third-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. Floyd was initially detained Monday by Minneapolis police because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. The statement on Friday from Portland’s chief of police, Frank Clark, was co-signed by Officer Les Smith and Sgt. Eric Nevins, who lead the patrol and supervisors’s unions, respectively. The police leaders expressed sorrow and frustration at Floyd’s death, and said they believe the professionalism, training and rigorous hiring standards in Portland mean there is little to no chance of a similar episode occurring in Maine. “You should know that the Portland Police Department has policies and strategies in place in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening here,” the letter said. “Our policies and training prohibit neck type restraints. They also call for our officers’ use of force to be in response to an actual or imminent threat.” The letter did not include a copy of the department’s use-of-force policy; the department has not responded to a request for a copy of the policy. In an interview early Friday afternoon, Clark said he and every other member of the department who has spoken to him about Floyd’s death has been taken aback by Chauvin’s actions, calling it “unacceptable.” “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement. I immediately think of the impact, wherever it is in the country, I think of the impact it’s going to have in our department and among our officers and in our community.” “Never say never, but one of the other initial reactions I had was that would not happen here,” Clark said. “That would not happen here in Maine or in the city of Portland.” Smith, the president of the local Police Benevolent Association, has more than 30 years on the job, and for the last decade has taught self defense and use-of-force classes to Portland’s officers at the state’s only police academy, in Vassalboro. “My first reaction was that (Chauvin) was not taught that at any academy and he was not taught that at the police department,” Smith said. “Our whole goal is to use just enough force to protect the officer, keep the suspect safe, and keep the civilian safe. From the perspective I saw in the video, it just seemed it was out of line. It was way, way too much.” Smith continued: “Its very frustrating to watch that happen. I put my heart and my soul into my training, and the Portland Police Department does the same. We take it very seriously. So when I see this, I take it to heart, when someone isn’t doing what they should be doing.” The death is the latest in a history of police-involved killings that stretches back years, in which mostly minority men have died at the hands of police. Some of the cases have resulted in prosecutions, while many have not. Police officers enjoy special legal protections while they perform their duties, which often include controlled acts of violence that are permitted in order to bring someone under control, or to protect themselves or bystanders. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. “Police departments around the country have been silent about the unnecessary killings of black people for far too long, so we are glad the Portland Police Department made this public statement,” said Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, Beyea said, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. “We wish the PPD and all Maine law enforcement would recognize and condemn the systemic racism that makes these killings so commonplace. Policies and protocols and training are important, but they won’t stop people from being killed until we address the root of the problem,” Beyea wrote. “It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,” she said. Police training in recent years has evolved to acknowledge that racism and unintentional bias play a role in how everyone views others and makes decisions, including police officers, and anti-bias training is now part of Portland’s training regimen and is reinforced through rotating classes that all Maine police officers must complete annually to maintain their certification.

1620660138,2020-05-30 00:48:55,George Floyd protests grow across the U.S.,https://www.koin.com/news/george-floyd-protests-grow-across-the-u-s/,en,True,,1406,koin cbs,http://www.koinlocal6.com/default.aspx,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

The agency, which typically patrols the nation’s border and ports of entry, said the drone was going to provide live video to assist law enforcement in Minneapolis as they responded to protests that have left dozens of stores burned and looted.

It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. 7:52 p.m. CNN Center in Atlanta Police cars getting literally destroyed in Atlanta outside the CNN Center pic.twitter.com/x5zRxZVQpb — Fernando Alfonso III (@fernalfonso) May 29, 2020 SWAT pushing in in ATL, CNN Center vandalized and has had windows smashed pic.twitter.com/EgMrEaYCTB — intelwave ⚓️ (@inteldotwav) May 29, 2020 Atlanta protesters burn American flag in front of CNN Center #GeorgeFloyddeath pic.twitter.com/89FLqW0GYt — ivan (@ivan8848) May 29, 2020 7:41 p.m. New York City protesters reach CNN The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard 'to protect people & property in Atlanta.' Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy 'immediately' to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: 'He said I can't breathe. Justice for George.' They chanted ''No justice, no peace' and 'Say his name. George Floyd.' After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting 'Quit your jobs.' At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: 'This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.' 'You are disgracing our city,' she told protesters. 'You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.' Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. 'We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?' he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. 'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. 'Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this.' The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. 'It's my duty to be out here,' said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard.' In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. 'My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed.' Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops' graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote 'killer' on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. 'It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,' he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death 'are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.'",0.0

(KOIN) — Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler admonished protesters on social media late Friday night as the city descended into chaos when peaceful demonstrations protesting police violence turned into a riot after marchers made it to the Multnomah County Justice Center. “ENOUGH,” Wheeler wrote in all caps on Twitter just before midnight. The mayor added he was heading back to Portland after leaving the city earlier to be at the side of his dying mother. “This is hard, this is personal, but so is watching my city get destroyed,” he wrote. ENOUGH.  I had to leave Portland today because my mother is dying. I am with family to prepare for her final moments. This is hard, this is personal, but so is watching my city get destroyed.  I’m coming back NOW. You will be hearing from me, @PortlandPolice, community leaders. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) May 30, 2020 He added he will address the public with Portland police and other city leaders. The mayor spoke with KOIN 6 News just before 2 a.m. Saturday, again condemning the night’s events, criticizing protesters for “dismantling our beloved communities in Portland, in Atlanta, in Minneapolis.” “Burning the city does not honor the memory of George Floyd,” Wheeler said, calling the night’s violence “disgusting.” Wheeler touched on his family situation, saying “it’s hard, it’s personal, but so is watching my city be destroyed.” He praised earlier peaceful demonstrations. But he had nothing but scathing remarks for those responsible for the night’s downturn and looting of businesses. “To the people responsible, I say enough,” Wheeler said. “They’re hurting the people who rely on these businesses for their livelihoods.” Wheeler has faced criticism in the past for his response to previous violent protests. On Friday night, thousands attended a peaceful vigil in Northeast Portland to remember George Floyd, a black man whose police custody death was caught on camera. A white office kneeled on his neck as he pleaded with him to let him breathe. The officer has since been fired and is now facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. However, as the vigil turned into a march through the streets of Northeast Portland and crossed the river, KOIN 6 News crews witnessed some protesters vandalize buildings with graffiti. KOIN 6 News crews also witnessed the Justice Center being broken into before having a small fire set inside in addition to some protesters breaking into Pioneer Place and stealing from luxury retailers. Fires have also been set in the streets across downtown, including at least one vehicle.",0.0

Acrid tear gas choked the air, the beating of helicopter blades throbbed overhead — and so much broken glass littered the sidewalks that it simply became background scenery. Perhaps the most destructive protest in downtown Portland's history broke out after a peaceful daytime rally honoring the death of George Floyd — the black man killed earlier this week by a white Minneapolis police officer as other officers watched — devolved in an unprecedented fashion. Police deployed smoky tear gas, flash bangs, rubber bullets and first declared an unlawful assembly and later a riot as protesters remained in the city's central core past 2 a.m. The city awoke to a rare and dramatic thunderstorm, along with destroyed stores and public facilities in the downtown core. In an interview with KOIN 6 News, Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty condemned the riot, saying the destruction of property has nothing to do with supporting black people. ""Destroying the city, and for what?"" Hardesty said. Widespread looting was visible at Pioneer Place mall, at Oregon's flagship Apple store, a Louis Vuitton outlet, a Starbucks, an H&M clothing store and at Capital One, Chase and Wells Fargo banks. Other buildings caught up in the crowd's rage included the Oregon State University store, a Target store, Kassal's Jewelry, the Multnomah County courthouse, and doubtless many others. Demonstrators used bats, traffic cones, skateboards and more than a few e-scooters to bust open windows and doors — creating sporadic outbursts of disorder that ebbed and flowed like a tide of violence. While the downtown may have seemed like a warzone, for some merchants, life went on. A 7-Eleven clerk did a brisk business with groups of masked protesters dressed all in black. Food carts continued to sell their wares, with some clients asking for milk to tend to their gassed faces.

Police retook the lobby of the building — which serves as the Portland Police Bureau's headquarters and as the downtown lock-up for the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office — and began to fire projectiles into the crowd.   Flares and other incendiary devices were thrown into a ground-level office while Corrections Records staff were working inside, according to a press release from the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Staff evacuated to a secure location within the Justice Center. The building's fire sprinkler system was activated and doused the fires, but caused extensive water damage. ""I am incredibly disappointed in Friday night's actions that put staff, adults in custody and the public in extreme risk,"" Sheriff Mike Reese said. ""This could have had tragic consequences in a corrections setting."" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler is set to hold a press conference at 8 a.m. Saturday at Portland City Hall, along with Mayor Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis, Portland Fire and Rescue Chief Sara Boone and Sheriff Reese. Graffiti and vandalism were reported throughout the night in other areas of the city as well. A column marched down Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard earlier in the night, leaving a trail of shattered glass in their wake on the other side of the Willamette River. The Nike store on that street appeared to take the brunt of the damage. The march turned violent as night fell following a largely peaceful rally held following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota four days ago. A local officer in Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with Floyd's murder after a viral video showed him pressing his knee on Floyd's neck. Demonstrators first gathered at Peninsula Park around 6 p.m. Friday, May 29. Protests have spread across nation since Floyd's death. On Thursday night, a small number of protesters camped out on the steps of the Justice Center and spray-painted Floyd's name on several pillars and a nearby fountain. One man was arrested during the Thursday, May 28 action; police said at least have been charged with riot on Friday. Damage estimates — still unknown at this point — are sure to be in the tens if not hundreds of thousands. Looting also broke out during a protest in Eugene.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a State of Emergency in response to the night of violence just before 4 a.m. Saturday. The emergency order includes a nightly curfew, effective immediately. The first night’s curfew lasted until 6 a.m. Saturday; curfew will resume 8 p.m. Saturday and extend to 6 a.m. Sunday morning, Wheeler said. Wheeler and other local leaders including Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis, Portland Fire and Rescue Chief Sara Boone, Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese, and others held a press conference Saturday morning to discuss the night’s events. PPB announced Saturday morning that police had arrested 13 people for a variety of charges including theft, burglary, riot and arson. More arrests are pending, the agency said. Jonathan Levinson/OPB The vigil began around 6 p.m. at Peninsula Park, where hundreds of people wearing masks and socially distancing gathered to hear speakers decry the death of Black Americans like George Floyd — a Minneapolis man who died Monday after police restrained him, kneeled on his neck for several minutes, and ignored Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe. As the group of more than 1,000 protesters made their way onto the Burnside Bridge, they slowed to a crawl to let everyone catch up and consolidate. Up front, a protester waved an upside down American flag and another group held a large sign that read, “I can’t breathe.” “It’s important to show representation for our people,” said protester Carlos, who didn’t want to use his last name. “It will be out here tomorrow. It could be out here next week. Just because it’s across the country today doesn’t mean it won’t affect us tomorrow.” The group paused once more on the west side of the bridge. Everyone in front locked arms before continuing into downtown Portland. “George Floyd! Say his name,” they shouted. Out in front of the protesters was Portland-based musician Spazz Gotti, elated and broadcasting on Facebook Live.  “Martin Luther King had a dream and we’re living it,” he said. “Everybody united marching together. This is amazing.” Eventually, some members of the crowd marched to the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. The building is home to the county jail and police headquarters. Video showed some protesters breaking windows on the building before entering, damaged computers, spraying graffiti and setting a small fire. Portland police in riot gear quickly moved into the area shortly after 11 p.m. and ordered people to disperse from the area. Police used tear gas and loud speakers to move the crowd away from the Justice Center and regain control of the building. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Shortly after the fire started, Wheeler urged protesters to remain peaceful. “Portland, this is NOT us. When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd? Protest, speak truth, but don’t tear your city apart in the process,” the mayor wrote in a tweet. Some protesters then moved on from the Justice Center and broke into stores and other buildings, including Apple and Louis Vuitton. Items were later dragged into the street and set on fire as Portland police continued to deploy tear gas. Just before midnight, as damage began to increase, Wheeler took to Twitter again, this time in a more emotional tone. ENOUGH.  I had to leave Portland today because my mother is dying.

However, fires continued well into the night, with one set of protesters starting a blaze inside a downtown Chase Bank location. It was not immediately clear early Saturday morning if anyone had been arrested during the riot. Speaking to KGW after 12:30 a.m., Wheeler said he plans to visit businesses Saturday that had been damaged by demonstrators.",0.0

Alex Zielinski More than a thousand Portlanders gathered in Peninsula Park Friday evening to memorialize George Floyd, the Black Minneapolis man who died Monday after an officer kneeled on his neck, cutting off his airway. ""Where was the threat of danger?"" Pastor Roy Tate asked the crowd, referring to Floyd's final moments. In a video taken of the encounter, Floyd is handcuffed, face down on the ground as Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck. ""There was none,"" he continued. ""They just killed another Black man. So what do we want? Justice!"" Tate was joined by dozens of other Portlanders of color on the park pavilion stage to decry Floyd's death and call for an end to police brutality against Black Americans. The megaphone was passed between school teachers, community activists, teenagers, religious leaders, and parents over the course of three hours (organizers sanitized the megaphone between each speaker). Members of the Black Riders Liberation Party speaking at the Friday vigil. Alex Zielinski Billy Ballastressi, told the crowd that he grew up in North Portland, and that he's too familiar with being harassed by Portland police officers—included some that he went to elementary school with. “I’m here because I’m tired of being an angry Black man,"" Ballastressi said. ""I'm more than that."" Speakers reminded the crowd that Portland is not immune to officer violence against its Black residents, pointing to the deaths of Kendra James, Keaton Otis, Aaron Campbell, Quanice Hayes, and Jason Washington.   Alex Zielinski ""I've been going through racism my whole life,"" said one 15-year-old boy. ""I feel like I shouldn't have to worry about somebody watching me when I walk down the street. I don't want to be the next Trayvon Martin. I want to live."" Another woman directed her statements to the demonstration's white attendees. ""I need for you to understand that Black people have been fighting this fight for a while,"" she said, wiping away tears. ""We need you to support us. We need you to trust Black people. Hire Black people. Invite Black people into your homes. Love Black people."" An estimated 90 percent of all attendees wore face coverings and generally adhered to social distancing rules by spreading out across the spacious park. Unlike past Portland demonstrations, no police officers or clear counter-protesters were in attendance. The event offered a stark contrast to other protests taking place across the country in response to Floyd's death that have been met with armored officers and protester violence. The Peninsula Park vigil wrapped at 9 pm, but the night's demonstration isn't over. Hundreds of protesters are now marching south down NE Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd towards Multnomah County Justice Center to join another group of protesters who've been camping outside the county building for several days.

Wheeler said the actions of rioters, which continued into the early morning hours of Saturday, were callous and selfish. “What I see here does not honor in any way the legacy of George Floyd,” he said. Wheeler commended the ""beautiful and heartfelt"" peaceful gathering organized by the NAACP that took place earlier on Friday. Before it turned into a riot, Friday night’s demonstration began as a vigil at Peninsula Park in North Portland. It was organized by the activist group PNW Youth Liberation Front and a large crowd showed solidarity with Minneapolis protesters and demanded justice for Floyd's death. Following the vigil, many of the demonstrators marched several miles from the park to downtown Portland.

Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. 'Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting 'No justice, no peace' as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to 'combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.' In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful 'because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" 'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. 'But I've heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called 'a terrible insult to police and to policemen.' 'I just expressed my sorrow,' Trump told reporters. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. 'The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. 'Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was 'no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.' 'It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. 'Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.' Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with 'two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.' Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump "" who rarely holds his tongue "" has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of 'purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.'",0.0

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.' Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife "" comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. 'Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,' Garza said. 'We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.' 'It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,' Garza added, 'and expect results, as usual.' ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

The crowd swelled to more than 300 people and set property on fire in front of the West Seventh Street at I-105 on-ramp, smashed the windows of local businesses, chanted now-familiar slogans against police violence, battered vehicles with their drivers still inside and set off fireworks. Some wore the surgical masks and other face coverings now common because of the coronavirus pandemic. Others did not. Eugene police called them ""an unruly mob"" in a news release issued early Saturday morning. The scene was similar, but on a smaller scale, to riots breaking out across the county over Floyd's death, including in Portland and Seattle. No arrests during the incident, but Eugene police Chief Chris Skinner said video would be reviewed to find people involved in criminal behavior and track them down. The protest apparently began peacefully outside the Lane County Courthouse Building just after 8 p.m. before moving moving toward 10th and Olive streets around 9 p.m., growing to about 200 people along the way, according to Eugene police. The crowd was moving up Seventh Avenue against traffic by 10:30 p.m., marching and chanting, getting honks and shouts from some drivers and residents they passed. The crowd chanted ""no justice, no peace“ and ”black lives matter,“ led on by the amplified voice of Clea Ibrahim, who said she didn’t organize the protest, but that “someone just gave me a bullhorn.” ""Who was murdered?"" she would ask. ""George Floyd!"" they would answer. ""Say his name!"" she would shout. ""George Floyd!"" At least twice during the march, some protesters shouted to each other they'd spotted a weapon in the crowd and the marchers did their best to expel those people. It's not clear anyone was actually armed, but protesters signaled to each other their intention for a peaceful display. Ibrahim told The Register-Guard later she wasn't a march organizer, only someone with a loud voice who was handed a megaphone. ""I didn't want to vandalize this town. I just wanted to run through the town and scream George Floyd's name,"" Ibrahim said. ""I didn't ask for the fire. I didn't ask to break those windows. I had no idea those windows were going to get broken. That's why I was trying to stop them."" The crowd marched from West Sixth Avenue up Washington Street and quickly took over the on-ramp and the intersection. When the crowd set up camp in the intersection, some group members started fires in the street soon after. “We were monitoring the impromptu demonstration last night,” Skinner said Saturday morning, “but wanted to allow that group space to walk and have their voices heard.” Skinner said that even though the protest was beginning to turn unruly, officers on site still stayed back in order to maintain order. After another round of chanting George Floyd's name atop the on-ramp, some protesters started knocking over road construction work signs, setting off fireworks in the street and, after several minutes going at it with a torch, setting one of those road signs on fire. Eugene police showed up for the first time around 11:15 p.m., standing shoulder to shoulder in front of their siren-lighted vehicles in an apparent show of force. They were well away from protesters, staying at West Sixth Avenue and Washington streets for a short time before leaving. ""Eugene police avoided escalating the situation by moving in, instead monitoring for safety,"" the Eugene police news release said. Protesters continued to add more and more to the fire that burned in the middle of the intersection. Traffic cones, several dumpsters, signs and flags from nearby businesses, fireworks, a tire, street signs, a metal picnic table from a neighboring business and an oily-looking barrel were all burned. Some in the crowd pleaded for calm. A man threw two buckets of water onto the flames with little effect. Then, the window smashing started. People broke in the windows at the business complex at Washington and Seventh, which includes Five Guys, Jimmy Johns, Sprint, Starbucks, and other businesses. The staff of Urban Vapors stood in front of their store to protect it from damage. Ibrahim, who still was leading chants, begged for the violence to stop. ""People are going to protest in their own ways. I can't make them stop. I tried. But they're grown adults,"" she said. Eugene police did not make their presence known at the scene again until about 12:40 a.m. Saturday, when people started to damage and break into local businesses. Eugene police deployed a SWAT team and received support from the Springfield Police Department. People in the crowd threw things at the police and police used a chemical deterrent to help disperse the crowd. “Our officers last night showed unbelievable restraint,” Skinner said. “No arrests were made in part because this takes several officers to make an arrest and we only wanted to stop the civil unrest.” Police said looters entered Starbucks and also had reports of subjects inside of Buy 2 at 110 W. Broadway, as well as looting at Hunky Dory, and shattered glass at Fire Horse. At 2:13 a.m., police deployed more chemical deterrent to push the crowds out and try to get rioters to disperse. On Saturday morning, businesses assessed the damages as crews began to clean up the broken glass and the aftermath of the looting and vandalism. Skinner and city officials, including City Manager Pro Tem Sarah Medary, assessed the damage with business owners. Skinner said he was surprised at the high percentage of people in the crowd that had bad intentions and participated in the looting.

Acrid tear gas choked the air, the beating of helicopter blades throbbed overhead — and so much broken glass littered the sidewalks that it simply became background scenery. Perhaps the most destructive protest in downtown Portland's history broke out after a peaceful daytime rally honoring the death of George Floyd — the black man killed earlier this week by a white Minneapolis police officer as other officers watched — devolved in an unprecedented fashion. Police deployed smoky tear gas, flash bangs, rubber bullets and first declared an unlawful assembly and later a riot as protesters remained in the city's central core past 2 a.m. The city awoke to a rare and dramatic thunderstorm, along with destroyed stores and public facilities in the downtown core. In an interview with KOIN 6 News, Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty condemned the riot, saying the destruction of property has nothing to do with supporting black people. ""Destroying the city, and for what?"" Hardesty said. Widespread looting was visible at Pioneer Place mall, at Oregon's flagship Apple store, a Louis Vuitton outlet, a Starbucks, an H&M clothing store and at Capital One, Chase and Wells Fargo banks. Other buildings caught up in the crowd's rage included the Oregon State University store, a Target store, Kassal's Jewelry, the Multnomah County courthouse, and doubtless many others. Demonstrators used bats, traffic cones, skateboards and more than a few e-scooters to bust open windows and doors — creating sporadic outbursts of disorder that ebbed and flowed like a tide of violence. While the downtown may have seemed like a warzone, for some merchants, life went on. A 7-Eleven clerk did a brisk business with groups of masked protesters dressed all in black. Food carts continued to sell their wares, with some clients asking for milk to tend to their gassed faces.    Apple store in Portland being looted during protest pic.twitter.com/GqmGCOqRkt — Zane Sparling (@PDXzane) May 30, 2020 In another climatic moment, demonstrators smashed windows and set fire to the atrium of the Justice Center during a stunning show of force. Police retook the lobby of the building — which serves as the Portland Police Bureau's headquarters and as the downtown lock-up for the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office — and began to fire projectiles into the crowd.   Flares and other incendiary devices were thrown into a ground-level office while Corrections Records staff were working inside, according to a press release from the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Staff evacuated to a secure location within the Justice Center. The building's fire sprinkler system was activated and doused the fires, but caused extensive water damage. ""I am incredibly disappointed in Friday night's actions that put staff, adults in custody and the public in extreme risk,"" Sheriff Mike Reese said. ""This could have had tragic consequences in a corrections setting."" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler is set to hold a press conference at 8 a.m. Saturday at Portland City Hall, along with Mayor Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis, Portland Fire and Rescue Chief Sara Boone and Sheriff Reese. Graffiti and vandalism were reported throughout the night in other areas of the city as well. A column marched down Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard earlier in the night, leaving a trail of shattered glass in their wake on the other side of the Willamette River. The Nike store on that street appeared to take the brunt of the damage. The march turned violent as night fell following a largely peaceful rally held following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota four days ago. A local officer in Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with Floyd's murder after a viral video showed him pressing his knee on Floyd's neck. Demonstrators first gathered at Peninsula Park around 6 p.m. Friday, May 29. Protests have spread across nation since Floyd's death. On Thursday night, a small number of protesters camped out on the steps of the Justice Center and spray-painted Floyd's name on several pillars and a nearby fountain. One man was arrested during the Thursday, May 28 action; police said at least have been charged with riot on Friday. Damage estimates — still unknown at this point — are sure to be in the tens if not hundreds of thousands. Looting also broke out during a protest in Eugene.

Floyd's death and footage of the officer pressing a knee into his neck for several minutes have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement "" exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there's much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. 'Progress and change can ebb and flow,' said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week "" including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned "" 'proved to me that we've regressed to the point of 2015,' Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis "" a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic "" has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. 'The system itself has not changed,"" Armstrong said. ""The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.' The city's police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city's police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union's president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Z�a-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a 'public response,' he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. 'We saw his eyes ... we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,' he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. 'My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe,' said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd's death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin's arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd's death 'just touched people in a way that they didn't expect,' said Armstrong. 'We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,' said Keith Ellison, the state's first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. 'We've got to literally shift policing.' Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. 'You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,' Finney said. 'You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as 'the police' and starts seeing you as their police.' ___ Morrison and Nasir are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) ATLANTA (AP) — Protesters burned businesses in Minneapolis. They smashed police cars and windows in Atlanta, broke into police headquarters in Portland, Oregon, and chanted curses at President Donald Trump outside the White House. Thousands also demonstrated peacefully, demanding justice for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck. As anger over Floyd’s killing spread to cities nationwide, local leaders increasingly said they could need help from National Guardsmen or even military police to contain the unrest. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia’s capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one whose tooth was knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. An LAPD spokesman told The Associated Press they were still tallying arrests. “I believe in our city. L.A. is strong enough to stand for justice and walk in love,” Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted, cautioning “violence and vandalism hurts all.” San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city’s officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s death. “It was a horrible injustice,” he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Two people were arrested during overnight riots in which protesters set fires throughout downtown and smashed storefront windows, police said, but arrest details were immediately available. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Mayor Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left the city to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. He later declared a state of emergency. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?”",0.0

Events Friday night in Eugene eventually included looting, vandalism and illegal burning. The Eugene Police said it was made aware of a small group gathering for Floyd around 8 p.m. at the Lane County Courthouse Building near downtown Eugene. “The crowd was initially peaceful,” the Eugene Police Department said in a news release. About an hour later, the crowd began to move through downtown and increased in size to about 200 people, EPD said. “The gathering morphed into acts of vandalism, illegal burning, damage to buildings, businesses and city property,” EPD wrote in its release. Around that time, the police said, people began spray-painting Lane Transit District buses, throwing fireworks into the Lane County Jail building and vandalizing the police auditor’s office. A large bonfire was started in the parking lot of a shopping center that includes businesses like Starbucks and Jimmy Johns, which eventually had their windows broken. “What is happening tonight is not a legitimate, free speech event,” said Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner. “It is illegal, irresponsible, is destroying local business and city property. It threatens the reputation of other peaceful and lawful events that don’t damage our city and put our residents and guests in harm’s way.” EPD deployed its SWAT team, assisted by the Springfield Police Department and Lane County Sheriff’s Office. The department also reported people looting Hunky Dory, a glass pipe shop, and shattering the window of Firehorse Trading Company, a recreational and medical cannabis store. After 2 a.m., EPD said it deployed gas to “push the crowds out.” The department said around 4 a.m. that crowds had largely dispersed, but that police remained in the area to monitor events. EPD said no arrests have been made, but the events are under investigation. A Black Lives Matter rally is planned in Eugene at 1 p.m. Sunday, The Register-Guard reports.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence.

Protesters broke into the police headquarters Friday night in Portland and authorities said they lit a fire inside. And a blaze built from cardboard boxes and other items burned in the middle of a street downtown and video showed people breaking into Pioneer Place mall and taking bags from a Louis Vuitton store. Police said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles and authorities later declared the gathering a riot. Blazes continued to burn early Saturday morning in multiple locations in downtown, including a building that housed a bank and broken glass littered the streets. ""All persons in downtown Portland: it is not safe, it is dangerous, there is rioting, leave now,"" Portland police said via Twitter. At least one shooting was tied to the protest, police said, although details weren't immediately available. Officers also said gas was deployed after people threw projectiles at them. Police said two people had been arrested in connection with the overnight disturbance and another person was arrested Friday afternoon. Friday night dozens of people also marched through downtown Seattle, with black-clad anarchists smashing up a storefront window. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said at about 11:50 p.m. that while he had left Portland to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back to the city.

Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best both said at a Friday evening news conference they were outraged by the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed after an officer put his knee on Floyd's head and neck. Durkan said the killing reflected the ""deep and systemic racism"" in the United States. She also said as a former federal prosecutor she believed it was right that the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck is facing charges. ""Tomorrow people in Seattle will gather to grieve and to protest,"" the mayor said. Best said she hoped everyone would remain calm and respectful. ""This should be a time for healing,"" she said. The Saturday afternoon rally is organized by a group working to reduce fatal police shootings.

They smashed police cars and windows in Atlanta, broke into police headquarters in Portland and chanted curses at President Donald Trump outside the White House. Thousands also demonstrated peacefully, demanding justice for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck. As anger over Floyd's killing spread to cities nationwide, local leaders increasingly said they could need help from National Guardsmen or even military police to contain the unrest. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. ""I just feel like he's just one of many names that we've had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,"" district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. ""And so that's why I'm out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you're taking the side of the oppressor."" Many protesters echoed that frustration, that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. The anger that seized the nation comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by a white father and son while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Say his name. George Floyd."" They hoisted signs reading: ""He said I can't breathe. Justice for George."" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately ""to protect people & property in Atlanta."" He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco's restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. ""This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,"" Bottoms said. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Bottoms was flanked by King's daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. ""We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?"" said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia's capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was ""a total loss,"" news outlets reported. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. The police department said numerous officers were injured. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. ""Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan's Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is the only way we're going to be heard."" Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: ""My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed."" Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops"" graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city's officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's death. ""It was a horrible injustice,"" he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren't immediately released.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen” if protesters angered by his response to George Floyd’s death had crossed the White House’s security fence. In a series of tweets hours after hundreds of demonstrators had massed outside the White House and scraped with officers in riot gear, Trump belittled them, doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, said they were only out “to cause trouble” and were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertions, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also directed social media criticism at the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. Trump’s reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” Trump’s tweets came hours before he planned to leave for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to take another crack at witnessing the first launch on American soil in nearly a decade of astronauts into space. He visited Cape Canaveral on Wednesday, but the launch had to be canceled because of the weather. Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, responded to the president by saying that “while he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism.” She also appealed for people in the District of Columbia and across the country “to exercise great restraint even while this President continues to try to divide us.” In protests that stretched past midnight, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and U.S. Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. The crowd of hundreds chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Fellow demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces. By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer’s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd. As the officers continued to push forward through the park, some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers. On Thursday, as violence broke out in Minneapolis, Trump tweeted, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. __ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Protesters set police cars ablaze, smashed businesses’ windows and skirmished with baton-wielding officers in streets from Atlanta to Los Angeles, as anger over George Floyd’s death spread across the country. Authorities were bracing for more violence Saturday, with some calling in the National Guard to beef up overwhelmed forces. In Minneapolis, the city where Floyd died Monday after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck and kept it there for more than eight minutes, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” On Friday alone, more than two dozen cities — from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — experienced protests, many peaceful but some of which turned violent. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. President Donald Trump did little to tamp down the anger, firing off a series of tweets ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The arrest and charging of the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck on Friday appears to have provided little balm. Georgia’s governor, meanwhile, declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta.

Violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked a Minneapolis neighborhood for a second straight night as angry crowds looted stores, set fires and left a path of damage that stretched for miles. The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. (Elizabeth Flores/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — First-term Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey appeared to be doing everything right. He worked with the city’s booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city’s body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd’s death. But Frey’s leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd’s death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city’s 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn’t confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, “What’s the plan here?” Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz — like Frey, a Democrat — criticized the “abject failure” of the city’s response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a “very weak Radical Left Mayor” and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn’t have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey’s approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd’s killing, refused to discuss the mayor’s response except to say that Frey had been “put in a difficult position.” He said the black community doesn’t trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. “The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,” Reeves said. “This is not about the mayor; it’s about the police department.” The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was “out of his depth” and “clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.” He said abandoning the police station “sent a powerful message” that the city was not in control. “There needs to be another message: ‘Here is the line and order will be maintained,’” said Jacobs. “You’ve got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. “He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.” Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. “There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,” said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. “They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.” But he believes the mayor is “leading with his values” and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. “Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it’s crumbled,” Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone, who is African American, said the anger and violence is not only about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but a system that allows people of color to ""feel fear every day."" ""This is a moment of reckoning,"" Boone said at a press conference with other city leaders. ""We are going forward to create an actual community, where respect and dignity are our core values."" Jo Ann Hardesty, an African American member of the City Council, said those responsible for the looting and burning were a small group of people who took the opportunity of earlier peaceful protests — that police had largely stayed away from — ""to steal stuff and break stuff."" ""We can get justice for black people, but we don't have to destroy our community to do it,"" Hardesty said. She offered to help identify rioters from video images so they could be arrested and prosecuted. Police arrested at least 13 people before dawn. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler imposed a State of Emergency and a curfew, which resumes Saturday at 8 p.m. and lifts at 6 a.m. Sunday. In the past, Portland has been the scene of numerous violent protests, often between far-right demonstrators and those opposed to them. Community activists have told police their heavy presence can be a trigger for violence. Their presence was light as peaceful protests started Friday. One vigil for Floyd was held at midday in a downtown plaza. Hours later, around 1,000 people attended another vigil at a park, but then some participants began marching toward downtown Portland, spraying graffiti and smashing windows, police said. A man in a car was grazed by a bullet, believed to have been fired by a protester, and was treated and released from a hospital, police said. Around 11 p.m., the marchers reached the Justice Center downtown, spray-painted the building, broke windows and started a fire. Riot police were deployed and the protesters dispersed, some walking to Pioneer Place Mall where they broke into certain stores and stole merchandise. As officers began arriving, protesters picked up electric scooters that are ubiquitous in the city and available for rent, and used them to break the windows of police vehicles, the Portland Police Bureau said. The officers retreated. ""No one could have predicted what we saw last night,"" Acting Police Chief Chris Davis said at the news conference. ""It's extremely difficult to predict where we're going to have this kind of violence."" Two police officers were injured by a thrown incendiary device and a rock. Blazes continued to burn early Saturday morning in multiple locations downtown — including a building that housed a bank — and broken glass littered the streets. The mayor choked up as he described trying to process what was happening to his city and the country. ""People of color, especially black men, have fought for generations to exercise their God-given rights to be valued as equals among men. Yet, time and time again they're reminded that the institutions that are supposed to protect those rights and support the people of this nation instead fail them and deny them their basic rights and, all too often, even their very lives,"" Wheeler said.

""It’s really sad to see after developing such good relationships with downtown businesses,"" Skinner said. ""My heart breaks for these businesses. After hanging on for 12 weeks with slowed traffic and shut doors during COVID-19 quarantine and now this happens."" The protest began peacefully outside the Lane County Courthouse Building just after 8 p.m. before moving toward 10th Avenue and Olive Street, growing along the way. Skinner said that even though the protest was beginning to turn into an unruly mob with fires being set at the intersection of Seventh and Washington, officers on site still stayed back in order to maintain order. ""We prioritize protecting human life and try to balance that with maintaining the safety of our officers. There was little damage to begin with, so our initial strategy was to sit back and let people do what they came to do, then disperse,"" Skinner said. The tipping point came when people started to damage and break into local businesses, he said. With an obligation to protect private property and assuage an escalation of violence, EPD deployed a SWAT team and received support from the Springfield Police Department. People in the crowd threw things at the police and police used a chemical deterrent to help disperse the crowd. ""Our officers last night showed unbelievable restraint,"" Skinner said. ""No arrests were made in part because this takes several officers to make an arrest and we only wanted to stop the civil unrest."" When a crowd turns dangerous, it’s EPD’s duty to create a safe environment for bystanders and officers on hand, police spokeswoman Melinda McLaughlin said. ""If a crowd fails to disperse, the use of tear gas is coordinated and controlled,"" McLaughlin said. ""Police are charged with ensuring a clear path of escape and dispersal."" After Friday night’s events, Skinner said that EPD will review what happened to make sure that the department has the right resources available and sets up strategies to intervene more quickly. Skinner was also surprised at the high percentage of people in the crowd with bad intentions and participated in the looting. ""There’s great video footage of last night’s violence,"" Skinner said. ""Our intent is to identify those individuals involved in this criminal behavior and track them down, but it’s going to be a long-term process."" As construction crews cleaned up and pedestrians and protesters still lingered, at least one Eugene citizen was working to help clean up the damage. Jimmy Lynch, a local skateboarder and ""surfside guy,"" was applying silver spray paint to a tagged light pole. ""The city will be busy with the big stuff for a while, so I thought I’d do my part,"" Lynch said.",0.0
1621108767,2020-05-30 14:46:00,Portland Leaders Condemn Violence That Rocked End Of Peaceful Protests,https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-leaders-condemn-violence-that-followed-peaceful-protests/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (4:30 p.m. PT) — Portland city leaders denounced the widespread looting and rioting that shook downtown Portland Friday night into Saturday morning, as a peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd turned destructive. Jonathan Levinson/OPB In response, the city imposed a curfew for 8 p.m. Saturday night that will end at 6 a.m. Sunday. It’s unclear whether the rule will quell protesters in Portland as large-scale demonstrations continued across the country Saturday. A large gathering on Friday in Peninsula Park to honor Floyd, a Black man whose death at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer has sparked outrage across the country, turned into a 4-mile march into downtown Portland. The protest devolved as protesters arrived at the Multnomah County Justice Center, the endpoint of the march. The Justice Center was lit on fire. Businesses were looted, broken and defaced. In remarks at Portland City Hall Saturday morning, Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty emphasized that the destruction was a departure from the rest of the day’s events, hosted to memorialize Floyd and acknowledge that, for too long, Black bodies in the United States have been treated as disposable. “What happened last night had nothing to do with Black America. It was not about standing up for Black people’s rights. It was not about acknowledging the death and harm that has taken place,” she said. “It was merely a small group of people who decided that, ‘Here’s a great opportunity for us to steal stuff and break stuff.’ “I will not accept that we need justice for Black people at the expense of tearing up our community,” she continued. The commissioner also thanked Mayor Ted Wheeler, who, at the time of the protests, was out of town with his family, discussing next steps for his mother in hospice care. The mayor said he returned to Portland in the early hours of Saturday morning and had not slept since early Friday. At the press conference Saturday, Wheeler appeared emotional as he described “a deep sense of moral conflict” coming off last night’s protests. “I cannot condone last night’s violence. I cannot stand by and watch our city be destroyed. I cannot stand by and watch buildings be set aflame while people are still in them. And I won’t,” he said. “But nor will I stand silent as men like George Floyd are murdered by the very institutions that are supposed to protect them and serve them and our communities at large.” Jonathan Levinson/OPB Wheeler declared a state of emergency before dawn Saturday in response to the violence. City leaders said they believed the rioting and looting did little to memorialize the man on whom the events were intended to focus: George Floyd, who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, suffocating him. “The self-concern, the casual destruction and the self-righteous determination to put others in harm’s way that was on display in the city last night does absolutely nothing to honor the legacy of George Floyd or to improve the systemic problems that led to his murder,” said Rev. E.D. Mondainé, the president of Portland’s NAACP chapter. In her remarks, Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone said Portlanders have civil servants to thank for the fact the city had not burned down. “Our members put their lives in harm’s way, in order to keep these fires small,” she said. “In order to save lives.” Staff working in the Multnomah County Corrections’ records division found themselves on the front lines alongside first responders Friday night as protesters lobbed pieces of concrete through the windows that the county sheriff estimated to be the size of softballs. Protesters used heavy objects to ram through the glass panes in the entryway. People came into the work spaces and set them on fire. Sheriff Michael Reese said the severe damage will limit the county’s ability to run services out of the building. Victims of domestic violence, he pointed out, use the facility to get restraining orders. Arraignment courts will need to be relocated. Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis categorized the riots as “one of the worst nights in Portland city history.” “Anger at the police is one thing. We’re used to that,” he said. “But destroying our city is another.” As of early Saturday morning, police had named 13 people arrested in the riots with more were being processed. The police bureau is also investigating a shooting in which they believe a demonstrator shot into a car. A passenger suffered a graze wound, but has been released from the hospital, according to the bureau. As the press conference wrapped up, reporters began asking questions about the police strategy and whether the police force could have used different tactics that would have proved more successful at quelling the violence. Davis said officers had tried to get ahead of riots by reaching out to leaders of the events. But protesters had ultimately taken the protest in a violent direction that no organizer had intended. “Frankly, we don’t know how many people who were at the event last night were even at Peninsula Park,” where the event began, he said. “It’s an extremely difficult thing to predict when we’re going to have this kind of violence.” He said the riots had proved particularly difficult to squash as protesters kept breaking out into smaller groups, looting businesses and lighting fires, and then coming back together and doing the same thing somewhere else. “A big question we have in the investigation into the event is to what extent was that coordinated because it was a fairly organized-appearing effort,” he said. Jonathan Levinson/OPB After a series of questions from reporters on the police tactics, Hardesty spoke out, expressing frustration that the line of questioning reporters were most interested in was the police response and not the pain that had caused the riot in the first place. “It wasn’t about what the police did or didn’t do,” she said. “It’s about what we didn’t do as a community, as a government, as responsible parties to represent the people in our community.” The commissioner, a longtime critic of Portland’s police force, added she believed the police did “an excellent job.” Following the press conference, Davis led the mayor on a tour of the destruction downtown. (Police Chief Jami Resch is currently on an unpaid furlough mandated by the city for many employees as a cost-saving measure during the pandemic.) Wheeler was led down to the destroyed Justice Center, past the Louis Vuitton Store, which had been looted of most if not all of its luxury bags, and the Apple Store, which had its glass walls shattered. On the walk, contractors for Graffiti Removal Service were scrubbing graffiti across downtown, an effort they said would likely take all weekend. Business owners were scraping broken glass from the storefronts. The mayor stopped to take a look through the shards of glass that remained in the windows at Bangkok Palace, a Thai eatery on SW Taylor Street. Andrew Hoan, the head of the Portland Business Alliance, who was doing his own survey of the damage Saturday, estimated the cost to Portland’s business will be in the millions. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Hoan said he sees the “wanton destruction” inflicted on downtown businesses Friday night as the final straw after months of lost revenue from the pandemic. “I absolutely assume any practical business owner, who is already reeling, who is already cash-strapped, who is really just clinging to business would certainly make the halfway responsible decision to close down permanently because the damage that was done here would be so difficult to recover from,” he said. “And also I think emotionally most people here are just done. “Whatever message they were trying to send, boy, it failed miserably,” he said. By Saturday afternoon, business owners across downtown were trying to get their businesses in decent shape. The broken windows at Bangkok Palace had been boarded up. Volunteers with the city’s Neighborhood Emergency Teams, residents trained to provide emergency disaster assistance, were busy washing away graffiti. Work crews were replacing the shattered glass panes outside Louis Vuitton. At Foot Traffic, a running store on SW Taylor Street, employees were taking stock of their remaining inventory. Fritz Fitzer, the store’s general manager, said it’s clear “a large percentage” of apparel and a “decent percentage” of their shoes were taken. One of their main windows had been broken. “On one hand, it’s just product. We have insurance. No one got hurt. That’s the important thing. The building’s still intact. We can recover from this,” said Fitzer. “But it’s difficult not to take this personally at this moment and feel like we just keep getting hit.” There are concerns that Saturday night will bring another round of potentially violent protests, as other cities have seen protests over Floyd’s death spread out over multiple nights. The city sent emergency alerts to Portlanders’ mobile devices to remind them of the curfew Saturday night. Officials are also asking Portland business owners to remove the board-signs outside their stores “as a precaution against their use as projectiles.” Fitzer said a part of him would understand if protests continued into Saturday night. “That frustration and anger — it’s real and it’s out there,” he said. “I’ve got to remain optimistic and the store has to remain optimistic and hope that we can weather this.”",0.0

Blazes continued to burn early Saturday morning in multiple locations in downtown, including a building that housed a bank. Police via Twitter labeled the event a riot before midnight and closed several streets. They said two people had been arrested in connection with the overnight disturbance and another person was arrested Friday afternoon.

Protests overnight: George Floyd protests intensify across the US A fire built from cardboard boxes and other items burned in the middle of a street downtown and video appeared to show dozens of people breaking into Pioneer Place mall and taking bags from a Louis Vuitton store. Police said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Earlier, thousands of people filled Peninsula Park in North Portland for a peaceful evening vigil that lasted three hours, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Hundreds then began marching through downtown to Portland police headquarters outside the Multnomah County Justice Center. There was scattered vandalism along the route.

(Photo: CHRIS PIETSCH / The Register-Guard) The crowd swelled to more than 300 people and set property on fire in front of the West Seventh Street at I-105 on-ramp, smashed the windows of local businesses, chanted slogans against police violence, battered vehicles with their drivers still inside and set off fireworks. Some wore surgical masks and other face coverings now common because of the pandemic. Others did not. Eugene police called them “an unruly mob” in a news release issued early Saturday morning.

(Photo: CHRIS PIETSCH / The Register-Guard) The protest apparently began peacefully outside the Lane County Courthouse Building just after 8 p.m. before moving toward 10th and Olive streets around 9 p.m., growing to about 200 people along the way, according to Eugene police. The crowd was moving up Seventh Avenue against traffic by 10:30 p.m., marching and chanting, getting honks and shouts from some drivers and residents they passed. The crowd chanted “no justice, no peace” and “black lives matter,” led on by the amplified voice of Clea Ibrahim, who said she didn’t organize the protest, but that “someone just gave me a bullhorn.” “Who was murdered?” she would ask. “George Floyd!” they would answer. “Say his name!” she would shout. “George Floyd!” At least twice during the march, some protesters shouted to each other they’d spotted a weapon in the crowd and the marchers did their best to expel those people. It’s not clear anyone was actually armed, but protesters signaled to each other their intention for a peaceful display. Ibrahim told The Register-Guard later she wasn’t a march organizer, only someone with a loud voice who was handed a megaphone. “I didn’t want to vandalize this town. I just wanted to run through the town and scream George Floyd’s name,” Ibrahim said. “I didn’t ask for the fire. I didn’t ask to break those windows. I had no idea those windows were going to get broken. That’s why I was trying to stop them.” - The Register-Guard and Associated Press contributing.

He worked with the city's booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city's body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his 'I can't breathe' pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd's death. But Frey's leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd's death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city's 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn't confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, 'What's the plan here?' Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz "" like Frey, a Democrat "" criticized the 'abject failure' of the city's response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a 'very weak Radical Left Mayor' and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn't have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey's approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd's killing, refused to discuss the mayor's response except to say that Frey had been 'put in a difficult position.' He said the black community doesn't trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. 'The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,"" Reeves said. 'This is not about the mayor; it's about the police department.' The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was 'out of his depth' and ""clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.' He said abandoning the police station 'sent a powerful message' that the city was not in control. 'There needs to be another message: 'Here is the line and order will be maintained,'' said Jacobs. ""You've got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. 'He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.' Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. 'There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,' said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. 'They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.' But he believes the mayor is 'leading with his values"" and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. 'Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it's crumbled,"" Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

Portland is still picking up the pieces. After a night of rioting that lasted until dawn, the city's downtown woke up to a hangover of broken glass, burnt-out cars, innumerable graffiti and busted storefronts, some boarded up, others left agape like a mouth full of punched-out teeth. Business leaders say the estimated damage, while still unknown, will be in the millions of dollars. And just as Multnomah County tiptoed toward a planned June 12 reopening, city leaders implemented a state of emergency and mandatory 8 p.m. curfew — effective immediately. In an emotional speech at City Hall, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Saturday, May 30, he hadn't slept in more than 24 hours after a period of rushed travel. He had been out of town meeting with family to discuss end-of-life care for his 90-year-old mother, Leslie, who is in hospice in Portland.

""Nor will I stand silent as men like George Floyd are murdered by the very institutions that are supposed to protect and serve them, and our communities at large."" Floyd's death in Minneapolis on May 25 has sparked widespread protests across the nation, including the riot in Portland. A Minneapolis police officer has been fired and charged with his murder after a viral video showed the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck. Wheeler and Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis toured several of the hardest hit sites, including the now barren Apple store as well as the Justice Center, where Davis said rioters reached the door leading to the county jail before they were repelled by a rapid response team. Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese said he saw looks of ""true fear"" on the faces of unsworn corrections staff who fled the ground-floor records-keeping unit after protesters stormed inside. Reese said the damage would only impede operations for a short time. For reasons not yet clear, Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch has been on ""mandatory, unpaid furlough,"" for the past three days, including the lead-up and aftermath to the nighttime riot. Her return date has not been specified. Davis, for his part, called the tumult ""one of the worst nights in Portland history,"" saying officers from the Port of Portland, Gresham Police Department and Washington County Sheriff's Office were called in to respond to citywide emergency calls as local police attempted to corral multiple groups of rioters who seemed to splinter and reform at will many times over the night.

""You don't prevent what happened last night by over-policing free speech,"" the deputy chief said. ""A big question that we have is: To what extent was this coordinated, because it was a fairly organized appearing effort."" City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said reporters at City Hall were too focused on police strategy rather than community healing, and said the media had broadcast images of black looters that didn't reflect the actual make-up of the crowds. ""I believe there was a small group of people who came out last night with a very strong intention of tearing stuff up,"" Hardesty said. ""I want those people prosecuted, I want them found, I will help them go through the video if need be."" By mid-morning, it was clear that clean-up of downtown Portland will be a Herculean task. Jewelers, burger joints, numerous banks, coffee shops, the Scientology center, outdoor apparel retailers, pharmacies, dispensaries and liquor stores all suffered from vandalism or loss of merchandise. ""There's millions of dollars of damage that has been done to our downtown core, for no good reason,"" said Andrew Hoan, CEO of the Portland Business Alliance. ""Our business community certainly cannot afford this kind of cost."" While the Rose City is no stranger to protests, with more than 300 occurring without incident each year, the scope of the mayhem on Friday night appeared to be unmatched — at least since the election of Donald Trump, or perhaps since the Occupy Portland movement in 2011. Authorities have announced injuries to three police officers, at least two hit by projectiles, and as many as 13 arrests as late as 5 a.m. Saturday.

Former Troutdale City Councilor Larry Morgan was in Minneapolis when he first saw the news about the overnight rioting in Portland. ""My first reaction when I saw the video was anger, and dismay. I was physically ill,"" said the 29-year-old African American, who now works for the city of Gresham. He also served as then-Secretary of State Dennis Richardson's first Citizen Outreach and Inclusion Coordinator. Morgan had flown to Minneapolis Friday at his own expense to take part in faith-based efforts to help the city heal after the death of George Floyd in police custody. A devout Christian, Morgan is scheduled to speak at a non-denominational spoken-word event there Saturday evening. ""I'm going to talk about my mother, who always protected me. It was so sad that the last words Floyd uttered was to cry out for his mother, who died two years earlier. I'm sure she had always protected him, too,"" he said. Morgan also watched the Saturday morning press conference at Portland City Hall, at which Mayor Ted Wheeler said he was pulled away from making final arrangements for his dying mother. Fire Chief Sara Boone, another African American, talked the difficulties of growing up black in America and called the rioting ""a day of reckoning."" ""It was so sad about Wheeler. Boone really talked from the heart,"" he said. Morgan only plans to stay in Minneapolis until Sunday evening, when he will return to his senior manager job. He felt compelled to make the trip, Morgan said, because of relationships he made attending Wheaton College in Illinois. While there, he worked with the Rainbow Push Coalition, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's network, several black activists, and peace and reconciliation organizations. He received a text from a friend telling him of the efforts in Minneapolis late Thursday. ""When the news of Mr. Floyd's murder began to circulate, I was able to get plugged back in with some of these networks — mostly faith-based organizations but also many strong African-American leaders in the Midwest,"" Morgan said in remarks prepared for Saturday evening's event. ""I believe that we are all called to action. Sometimes that means sitting on the couch and being angry; but for me it meant to come here and work with the people that I love eternally."" Speaking to the Portland Tribune from Minneapolis, Morgan said the scene there is apocalyptic. Most downtown buildings are either boarded up or destroyed. Many of those still standing have signs that say ""Minority-owned business — please don't loot."" According to Morgan, some of the rioters there don't care about protecting the minority-owned businesses. ""I talked to one African-American woman who owned a business for 44 years. They burned her building down. It was destroyed in minutes,"" Morgan said. Morgan also believes that many of the rioters are not even from Minneapolis. Eighty percent of those arrested reportedly live outside the city.

As the death of George Floyd sparked widespread condemnation after disturbing video spread across social media showing a police officer with his knee on Floyd’s neck as he yelled out, ""I can't breathe,” the president remained silent for days on the topic.  Trump instead tweeted repeatedly about topics in the news and pushed unfounded claims about mail-in ballots being tied to widespread fraud and continuously promoted a baseless murder conspiracy, despite a widower’s plea, to smear a cable news host.  The president first commented on Floyd's death Wednesday afternoon after being asked by a reporter while touring Kennedy Space Center. He would go on to announced he'd asked the F.B.I. and Justice Department to investigate the incident.  But at nearly 1 a.m on Friday, as protests were raging around the country in the wake of another in-custody death of a black man, the president seemingly reverted to a place critics say he often heads; stoking heated tensions and fanning the flames of longstanding racial division.  In late-night tweets, which Twitter flagged for “glorifying violence,” the president smeared protesters as “thugs,” threatened to use military force to “assume control,” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” echoing a phrase first used by a Miami police chief that civil rights groups have widely condemned.  Trump and the White House have since tried to walk back the comments, claiming the president was not encouraging violence and that the president meant “looting leads to shooting,” saying he didn’t know the phrase's origins.  The president’s campaign in a statement blamed the media, Twitter, and Democrats for “twisting of President Trump’s words… to take the entire nation down the worst road imaginable.”  “The facts show that the President expressed horror over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and ordered the Department of Justice to get involved. When riots erupted in that city and elsewhere, he warned on Twitter that looting could quickly turn into violence,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.  But, senior Trump campaign advisor Katrina Pierson defended the president’s words on Twitter writing, “There’s no problem standing up to the looters and vandals,” in response to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticizing Trump for suggesting looters should be shot.  Trump’s remarks were swiftly condemned by activists and critics claiming Trump’s words suggesting looters should be shot showed a stark difference between how the president responds to civil unrest depending on who’s protesting, pointing to Trump’s tweets from a few weeks back egging on mostly white and some armed conservative groups protesting lockdown measures amid the coronavirus in contrast to his remarks on majority black protesters in Minnesota.  “You’re quick to send your troops to kill us?” Leslie Redmond, the head of Minneapolis NAACP said at a press conference on Friday. “You were crying, ‘liberate Minnesota,’ when it came to economics, property, and money. When are you going to tell them to liberate black people in America?”  But following a night of civil unrest across the country, the president Saturday morning again threatened violent retaliation against protesters.  Hundreds of people gathered outside the White House Friday night to protest Floyd's killing and the president's response, and amid boiling conflict Trump took to Twitter and goaded the protesters writing that if the demonstration had escalated, ""that’s when people would have been really badly hurt""—threatening to sick the ""most vicious dogs"" and turn the ""most ominous weapons"" against them, even seeming to revel in the idea that ""many Secret Service agents just waiting for action.""  The president also, after threatening to use lethal force if protests escalated, appeared to urge pro-Trump demonstrators to show up to the White House on Saturday night, tweeting: ""Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???"" A move that many in response have pointed out could lead to escalated tensions.  Trump’s comments are the latest example of the president’s tendency to seemingly pour gasoline on flaming racial tensions. In 2017, after the massive white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the president said there is “blame on both sides,” leading to widespread condemnation that he was blustering racist groups.  And last summer, Trump told a group of four American congresswomen of color to “go back” to where they came from, a comment that ignited condemnation from Democrats and Republicans.  And as protests rage over Floyd's killing, which many Americans decry as the latest example of police brutality against African Americans, the president's history of urging law enforcement to use excessive force is facing renewed scrutiny. During a 2017 speech to law enforcement officers, the president urged against protecting the heads of suspected gang members when putting them in police cars. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car, and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put your hand over...I said, ‘You can take the hand away, O.K.?’”  Trump’s latest remarks amid tensions in Minneapolis over the death George Floyd come in an election year and while his campaign has heavily invested in an effort to appeal to black voters, with plans to open retail-style stores in black neighborhoods, a multi-million dollar Super Bowl ad buy, and the launch of a “Black Voices for Trump” coalition.  “I think this is an opportune time to really show African Americans that they're trying to engage that they understand the grievances of the overall community, and what not a better time to showcase that than when the community is grieving about injustices,” political strategist Shermichael Singleton told ABC News.  And following the president’s lead, the campaign had remained on the sidelines for days as Floyd's death sparked mass condemnation, including by presumptive Democratic nomniee Joe Biden, and devastated and took an emotional toll on the black community they are working to court. Many on the president's team began speaking out on Floyd's death on Thursday amid rising protests across the country and to condemn rioting.  ""Looting is not protesting. Burning down local homes and businesses is not protesting. How sad that the memory of #GeorgeFloyd has been lost in all of this,"" Trump campaign senior advisor Lara Trump tweeted.  But as the campaign has worked to hijack the phrase “woke” in an attempt to connect with voters, selling hats, shirts, and hoodies embroidered with the phrase groups like Black Lives Matter worked to popularize, some believe their response in times of racial violence has been anything but socially aware of racial injustice.  ""Like all Americans, the Trump campaign was shocked and horrified over George Floyd’s death. The campaign and our surrogates have been active in condemning both Floyd’s death and the violent outbursts that have followed it,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, pointing out that ""unlike Joe Biden, who has no actual responsibilities, our candidate is the President of the United States, who has responsibility for the Department of Justice. When the President addressed Floyd’s death and quickly thereafter announced the DOJ civil rights investigation, the campaign amplified that action.""  The campaign said they issued a statement to reporters on Floyd's death on Thursday and said ""the country is still dealing with this tragedy, it is important for Americans to come together peacefully, call for clear-eyed justice, and unite as one nation.”  In contrast, it took moments for the re-election campaign to launch an all-out onslaught to attempt to smear former Vice President Joe Biden as a “racist” after his now infamous Breakfast Club interview, first posted online last Friday.  “This is disgusting,” the Trump campaign tweeted less than an hour after the interview appeared on YouTube, along with a clip of Biden telling radio host Charlamagne Tha God that black voters “ain’t black” if they’re still deciding between voting for him or the president. Biden later that same day during a call with the National Black Chamber of Commerce conceded that he was “much too cavalier” in his remarks, and said he did not take the black vote for granted.  Still in the hours leading up to that call, the president’s campaign team deployed a full-scale blitz utilizing its massive war chest, organizational might, and “Black Voices for Trump” coalition to try and capitalize on Biden’s comments as part of the Trump campaign’s latest effort to appeal to black voters, a core voting block for the former vice president and Democrats.  The Trump team helped push a #YouAintBlack hashtag that trended across Twitter--They dropped a $1 million ad-buy promoting Biden’s comments and labeling him a “racist."" And before noon last Friday, the Trump campaign had scheduled and held a press conference call featuring South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the sole black Republican senator, to blast the presumptive Democratic nominee’s comments.  And as thousands took to the streets to demand justice for Floyd, the Trump campaign blasted its “Black Voices for Trump” email list on Wednesday afternoon still highlighting Biden’s comments, asking voters to mobilize behind President Trump.  On Friday night, the Trump campaign emailed supporters and the media a list of “what The Trump campaign is saying about the tragic loss of George Floyd,” which featured campaign officials like senior advisor Lara Trump condemning looting. But most Trump campaign officials remained silent regarding the incident until Friday when they issued statements online days later condemning the looting and protests in the wake of Floyd’s death along with condolences.  Biden first addressed Floyd’s death in a tweet on Tuesday calling for a “ thorough investigation” and adding “George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.”  A day later, Biden again addressed Floyd’s death during a digital event on Wednesday, arguing that the incident--and its similarities to Eric Garner’s case from five years ago which saw a white New York City police officer caused the chokehold death a black man, proved just how much further the country needs to go to root out systemic injustice.  “It cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights and in dignity, and it sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat, every single day,” Biden said.  Along with touting the landmark criminal justice reform bill the president signed into law in late 2018, Trump had planned to use historically low black unemployment, which began to decline under President Barack Obama as his main pitching point to black voters, but with those numbers skyrocketing amid the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately impacting black and minority communities, his team has switched focus to painting Biden as a racist.  Plans for the Trump campaign to open up retail style community centers in several predominantly black cities in battleground states in an effort to pitch minority voters have been put off during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, Trump allies also held independent events in black communities, touting the president’s record and giving away thousands in cash.  In 2016, Trump won just 8% of African-American voters. And as the Trump campaign has ramped up efforts to court black voters, advisers say even a marginal increase in support in key battleground states would have a significant impact.  “It defies all logic and reason for Donald Trump to try to court black voters while trying to win white votes by calling black people 'thugs' and amplifying racial violence,” Yvette Simpson, CEO, Democracy for America and ABC News contributor said.  “The Trump campaign's attempts to win black votes aren't about serving black people, they're about distracting the public (and especially white voters) from the image of an incompetent president who used bigotry and racial resentment to fuel his political rise, and who continues to fuel the fire of hate and racism today,” Simpson told ABC News.  Darrell Scott, a close ally to President Trump told ABC News discussions are underway to resume those events.  Scott, who President Trump called a “very good friend” during a listening session with African American leaders in Michigan this month, serves as the CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump and Urban Revitalization Coalition.  He pushed back against accusations the community events, which he called “nonpartisan” are trying to buy the black vote.  “To imply that the black community would have a vote to sell or to imply that we thought so less of the black community to entice them with the selling of a vote is offensive,” Scott told ABC News.  Scott, who also serves as a co-chair for the “Black Voices for Trump” coalition is one of few campaign officials who spoke out publicly immediately following Floyd’s death.  “It’s more than a “Black Rights” issue, it’s a “Human Rights” issue,” Scott stated on Twitter.

The protest followed a peaceful vigil honoring the life of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police in Minneapolis this week. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) declared it a riot late Friday night. Police arrested 13 people in connection to the protest, on charges of rioting, theft, disorderly conduct, and interfering with a police officer. According to PPB, two officers and one protestor sustained minor injuries, and at least one shooting occurred in connection with the protest. At a press conference Saturday morning, Wheeler noted that the “scale of the damage” from Friday’s protest was “not something we’re familiar with here in Portland.” He also acknowledged that the protest “did not happen in a vacuum.” “I don’t condone what happened in Portland last night… [but] this isn’t just about damage or graffiti or fires or broken storefronts or lost product,” he added. “We have to honestly acknowledge that yesterday’s events boiled over into anger and frustration and rage all across this great nation.” In a press release announcing the state of emergency, Wheeler also issued a curfew beginning 8 pm Saturday evening and ending at 6 am Sunday morning. The curfew prohibits people from traveling throughout the city, with exemptions for first responders and people experiencing emergencies or houselessness. Violations are punishable ""by criminal prosecution,"" per the press release. City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty strongly denounced the protest at the press conference. “[The protest] was merely a small group of people who decided that, here’s a great opportunity for us to steal stuff and break stuff. I want those people prosecuted,” she said. “We can help Black people, but we don’t have to destroy our city to do it.” Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said Friday night “will go down in history as one of the worst nights in Portland,” and noted that “in the coming days we’ll be increase our police presence.” E.D. Mondaine, head of the Portland NAACP chapter, also denounced the protest’s activities at the press conference. “The self-concern, the casual destruction, and the self-righteous determination to put others in harm’s way… does absolutely nothing to honor the legacy of George Floyd, or improve the systemic problems that led to his murder,” he said. “To our non-Black allies, do not commit violence in our names.” Portland was one of many United States cities that had intense protests Friday night in response to Floyd’s death.

(KOIN) — Early Saturday morning, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a State of Emergency in the city and imposed an 8 p.m. curfew after demonstrations over the death of George Floyd turned destructive and police declared a riot. A short time later, Wheeler walked through the city alongside journalists to assess the widespread damage. Businesses that were already struggling to survive through a pandemic are now faced with the added challenge of cleaning up the damage. KOIN 6 News spoke with business owners who said they haven’t been open since the pandemic started. On Saturday, some of those same businesses were cleaning up broken glass and graffiti after downtown Portland was vandalized, tagged, and torched overnight. “They left glass shards everywhere, so we have to clean that up and trying to fix everything right in front of the window display,” said one employee who works at the 4th Avenue Smoke Shop and convenience store. Photos: Damage to downtown Portland after overnight riot Teams from Downtown Portland Clean and Safe, Central City Concern, as well as private owners and building managers, were out sweeping up broken glass and boarding up multiple businesses, including the Apple store where people tagged “I can’t breathe” on the windows. Mitch Miguel, who works in facility maintenance for several downtown buildings, boarded up about six businesses after rioters cleared out the neighborhood. “We work down here, trying to make the city a better place for the citizens to live and work, and these people take it from us,” said Miguel. “I can’t believe what they did. This wasn’t justice—it was plain criminal.” The Portland Business Alliance released photos of the clean up, as well as a statement on the aftermath of the riot. “We as a community stand together in support of peaceful demonstrations that call out the systemic hate in any city. We condemn those who choose violence or to take advantage and loot and riot, especially under the devastating economic conditions we all face.“ After last night’s events, Wheeler took a walk through the city to survey the damage. He said city leaders are working on supporting small businesses. “The city is helping board and clean up the graffiti,” said Wheeler. “Then there is the legal process, the people who committed these acts of vandalism, and we will prosecute to the best of our ability.” “Violence is never the answer, we need to rise up,” said Wheeler.

Statement from Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis, Springfield Mayor Christine Lundberg and Lane County Commissioner Heather Buch People are angry. We should all be angry. The violence and injustice that has ravaged communities of color in our country for so long is intolerable and we must do everything we can to stop it. We have a racist history in Eugene, Springfield, Lane County, Oregon, and the United States, and we need to own that. We have a choice: we can listen and respond to justifiable anger with compassion and constructive change; or we can allow ourselves to be torn apart. We honor the right and importance of peaceful protest. The voices that have been silenced by outright and systemic racism must be heard. But what started as a peaceful protest last night turned into a violent, dangerous situation. The people who engaged in these acts of violence do not represent our community or the people who were there to advocate for meaningful and needed change. The event started as a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in response to the death of George Floyd. We do not condone or accept the destructive acts that took place last night in downtown Eugene. This is not a path to justice. This is a path to more suffering. Nationwide Black, Indigenous and Communities of Color are experiencing higher infection, death rates, job loss and economic instability. Dismantling systemic racism is a critical solution to supporting community recovery. Our local businesses already face an incredible struggle to recover from the pandemic. These acts just make it harder. We are proud of the thoughtful and measured response from the Eugene Police Department with the assistance of the Springfield Police Department and the Lane County Sherriff’s Office. Their priority was safety and while we are truly saddened by the needless destruction of businesses and property, we remain very thankful there were no serious injuries throughout last night’s events. ""We strive to be a City of Kindness,"" said Mayor Vinis. ""That calls on us to listen and to respond to one another with open hearts and minds. Destruction is not the pathway to realizing our goal to be a welcoming community for everyone. We must work together.""",0.0

(KOIN) — Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of downtown Portland in thesecond straight night of unrest, mirroring the dozens of other protests in other major US cities. Protesters from coast to coast took to the streets over the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. At least 48 people were arrested during the protest, police said, ranging in age from 19-49. A total of 26 people were charged with curfew violations, but all of them faced other, more serious charges, including riot, burglary and disorderly conduct. Another 9 minors were detained and released to their parents on charges including curfew violation, riot, disorderly conduct, riot, burglary, theft. Though the crowds were split into smaller groups, there were pockets of intense activity still going on in different areas around 11 p.m. PPB worked in partnership with the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, Washougal Police Department, and Oregon State Police, authorities said. Different tactics The action began ramping up around 6 p.m. when about 500 people gathered outside the Justice Center in an almost immediate confrontation with police. Demonstrators chanted, “No justice, no peace,” and cars honked their horns as they drove by. Portland Police declared the assembly unlawful shortly after 7 p.m. and told the crowd to disperse. May 30, 2020 (KOIN) Police used different tactics Saturday, wasting no time in dispersing the crowd and breaking it up into much smaller factions. They continued using that tactic — dispersing crowds quickly and not letting them form into bigger, more volatile mobs. Flash bangs were used early and often, loudspeakers told the protesters to “leave the park now” and tensions mounted. Portland police declared an “unlawful assembly” at 7:14 p.m. and ordered people to disperse. By 7:40 p.m., PPB said one person had been arrested. By 10:30 p.m. there were 13 people arrested. Around 8:30 p.m., PPB Chief Jami Resch said the protest was now officially a “civil disturbance.” About an hour later, another unlawful assembly was declared in the Lloyd District neighborhood. Police in tactical gear rode vehicles and used loudspeakers to inform the crowd the curfew was in effect and they were subject to arrest if they didn’t leave. But no one left. Crowds reformed along SW 4th Avenue in two separate spots north and south of Alder, along the waterfront and at NW 3rd and W. Burnside outside the Union Gospel Mission, where protesters were seen throwing items and spray painting as the 8 p.m. curfew began. More flash bangs were dispersed around SW 4th and Alder around 8:30 p.m., which scattered protesters. The familiar chant of “Whose streets? Our streets!” was heard as one group of protesters marched around SW 3rd and Salmon. However, around 9 p.m. the crowds had thinned considerably. That did not mean the protesters were gone. Police continued to block streets, move protesters and try to maintain control. At one point, an alarm was heard going off at the Louis Vuitton store, which was vandalized and looted Friday night. In a video tweet at 9:47 p.m. Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese said, ““We need to restore peace in Downtown PDX.. the demonstration has been declared a civil disturbance. Those in the area are ordered to disperse. We must do everything we can to keep our community safe. We have called in all available deputies to assist.” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a State of Emergency and imposed a curfew on the city after a night of destructive protests damaged downtown businesses and set fire to the Justice Center. The curfew is in effect from 8 p.m. Saturday night until 6 a.m. Sunday morning. Under the curfew, all residents are prohibited from travelling on any public streets. City leaders want to avoid a repeat of what KOIN 6 News reporters witnessed first-hand while on the ground reporting Friday night. It started Friday night with the destruction of the Justice Center. Protesters smashed out the glass windows and got inside the building, trashing the office space and started a fire before police could clear the building with gas, according to law enforcement.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore — In the aftermath of the riots, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, faith leaders and law enforcement walked around downtown Portland to see the destruction first hand in the light of day. Dozens of businesses - big and small - were hit in the riot. Throughout the day, business owners and employees who've already lost so much during this pandemic mopped up messes. ""I've never seen anything of this magnitude,"" Mayor Wheeler said, ""The damage here is widespread. It’s not localized, it’s all throughout the downtown area."" The sound of drills boarding up shattered windows echoed across Downtown Portland Saturday. Business owners, their staff, property owners, contractors, city agencies, volunteers and cleaning crews were sweeping glass off sidewalks, scrubbing spray painted messages off walls, and trying to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of the riots. Ammi Brooks is apart of the Artistic Portland cooperative and after watching the riots play out on the news, came down to the store at 8 a.m. Saturday morning to find broken windows and glass shattered everywhere. ""I just hope this isn't all for naught, for what's going on in our country and in Portland,"" said Brooks. ""I hope something changed or transformed and that things will be better. I'm optimistic. But then, it's been going on for a long time."" The dust had barely settled when Mayor Wheeler, law enforcement and faith leaders walked the streets to try to grasp the extent of the damage. ""It's just a sad day for our city,"" the mayor said when he saw smashed windows at Bangkok Palace. The smell of smoke from cars and buildings set on fire still lingered in the air Saturday afternoon. ""There's not a question this actually takes away from what was a really heartfelt and meaningful national day for demonstrations yesterday,"" Wheeler said. ""This in no way supports the legacy of Mr. Floyd. I don't see how this is in any way helpful to anybody's cause or values."" In a time when businesses across the board are suffering from the economic fall-out of the coronavirus crisis. The Portland Business Alliance says what happened hours after the peaceful protests was ""simply anarchy"" and they condemn those involved with the looting and wanton destruction of Portland. ""The damage also occurred at a point in time where our business community cannot afford this kind of cost,"" Portland Business Alliance President Andrew Hoan said. ""This is just the worst timing, worst behavior and unacceptable by any standards of peaceful demonstrations that we support."" Portland Business Alliance is calling upon city and state leaders to activate the National Guard to support the Portland Police Bureau should looters return to Portland's streets Saturday night. Brent Collier owns a small men's clothing store downtown. He got a call in the middle of the night from the manager of his store, telling him to turn on the TV and watch the news. He knew it would be dangerous to go down and check out what was going on for himself, so he waited till Saturday morning. ""We pulled up and it's like, 'Oh man, we got hit',"" Collier said. ""Just out of nowhere, no preparation. Just kind of a bummer on top of bummers."" Collier just reopened his store Collier's after shutting down to curb the spread of COVID-19. ""It's just tough, getting that little bit of pride back that I haven't felt in a while because I've always been proud of my store, I've always tried to make it look good,"" Collier said. ""It's a little thing but it means a lot to you, so just to have that taken away and not feel that again and just getting back to some of that."" He says looters took thousands of dollars worth of whatever they could grab inside the store: masks, expensive luggage, suits, and wallets. Signs posted in his window express his feelings of violation and heartbreak. They read: ""Our window is broken. Our spirits are broken"" and, ""We are a ma and pa biz. Be kind."" ""[I'm] still keeping a good attitude,"" said Collier. ""There's nothing you can do, you know.""",0.0

At a Saturday evening press conference, Eugene Ward 6 City Councilor Greg Evans said members of the black community had been talking this afternoon about the issues and events that happened. ""What we have come up with is this: We do not support the vandalism and the criminal activity that happened overnight. We are a positive group of people and we stand in solidarity and strength, so that we don’t want this to happen in Eugene ever again,"" Evans said. ""We want to come together united both African Americans and our allies so we can support the advancement and growth of our African American community in Eugene and in the state of Oregon."" Sen. James Manning, who represents District 7 - North Eugene, West Eugene, Santa Clara, and Junction City, also spoke, condemning the police use of force that led to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He said he planned on introducing state legislation regarding police use of force. ""I don’t condone any violence. The things that occurred in Eugene last night were reprehensible,"" he said. He said he will be talking with and listening to the community ""to find out how we move forward,"" noting that include economical help, housing and other opportunities. ""This pandemic has shown us now that it has ripped away the Band-Aid and we thought where it was a scratch and find it a gaping hole. There is a gaping hole in the soul of America,"" he said. ""In order to fix this, we have to rise together."" At the Saturday evening press conference, Brittany Quick-Warner, president and CEO at Eugene Area Chamber of Commerce, thanked the community members who arrived Saturday morning ""with brooms, scrub brushes and asked ’How can I help?’ That is Eugene."" The temporary nighttime curfew, implemented by City Manager Pro Tem Sarah Medary on Saturday, was originally only for downtown Eugene, but was expanded to the whole city later Saturday night. Eugene police made several arrests for ""unlawful behavior"" overnight as groups gathered downtown and around Valley River Center, police said in an early Sunday morning press release. There were reportedly ""small groups of mostly younger individuals with signs and masks roaming in various parts of the downtown and other areas, including Valley River Center,"" Melinda McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Eugene Police Department, said in the news release. Statement from Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis, Springfield Mayor Christine Lundberg and Lane County Commissioner Heather Buch People are angry. We should all be angry. The violence and injustice that has ravaged communities of color in our country for so long is intolerable and we must do everything we can to stop it. We have a racist history in Eugene, Springfield, Lane County, Oregon, and the United States, and we need to own that. We have a choice: we can listen and respond to justifiable anger with compassion and constructive change; or we can allow ourselves to be torn apart. We honor the right and importance of peaceful protest. The voices that have been silenced by outright and systemic racism must be heard. But what started as a peaceful protest last night turned into a violent, dangerous situation. The people who engaged in these acts of violence do not represent our community or the people who were there to advocate for meaningful and needed change. The event started as a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in response to the death of George Floyd. We do not condone or accept the destructive acts that took place last night in downtown Eugene. This is not a path to justice. This is a path to more suffering. Nationwide Black, Indigenous and Communities of Color are experiencing higher infection, death rates, job loss and economic instability. Dismantling systemic racism is a critical solution to supporting community recovery. Our local businesses already face an incredible struggle to recover from the pandemic. These acts just make it harder. We are proud of the thoughtful and measured response from the Eugene Police Department with the assistance of the Springfield Police Department and the Lane County Sherriff’s Office. Their priority was safety and while we are truly saddened by the needless destruction of businesses and property, we remain very thankful there were no serious injuries throughout last night’s events. ""We strive to be a City of Kindness,"" said Mayor Vinis. ""That calls on us to listen and to respond to one another with open hearts and minds. Destruction is not the pathway to realizing our goal to be a welcoming community for everyone. We must work together.""",0.0

The crowd is currently gathered at Chapman Square (210 SW Main).Jim Ryan of the Oregonian is reporting lots of tear gas in the air at SW 2nd and Yamhill. ORIGINAL POST: For the second night in a row, protesters have flocked downtown to protest the death of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who was killed by a police officer who kneeled on his neck as Floyd cried, ""I can't breathe."" He eventually suffocated to death. Last night's protest started very peacefully with a vigil for Floyd at North Portland's Peninsula Park. Following the vigil, hundreds marched downtown to the Multnomah County Justice Center, where a splinter group broke into the building and set a small fire. Police—who had been maintaining their distance throughout the evening—rushed in, and the crowd scattered into the downtown corridor. Groups of protesters broke windows of banks, set small fires, and looted a very particular, highbrow set of stores, including the Apple store and Louis Vuitton. Police fired tear gas and flash bangs at the crowds throughout the evening, before the crowds dispersed just after 2 am. Thirteen people were arrested. Mayor Ted Wheeler gave a press conference this morning, decrying the violence and looting, and set a curfew for the entirety of Portland tonight from 8 pm to 6 am . As we approach the 8 pm hour, it doesn't look like a large group of downtown protesters are going anywhere—and neither is the Mercury who will be covering the protests tonight. We'll be publishing regular updates here, but for moment to moment action, follow our Alex Zielinski and Blair Stenvick on Twitter. Stay tuned for more.",0.0

'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

For the second consecutive night, hundreds protesters descended on the streets of downtown Portland following the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Hours before a fresh 8 p.m. curfew, about 500 people gathered outside the Justice Center in an almost immediate confrontation with police. Flash bangs were used early and often, loudspeakers told the protesters to ""leave the park now"" and tensions mounted. Police tactics are different Saturday than Friday. On Saturday, police wasted no time in dispersing the crowd and breaking it up into much smaller factions. Portland police declared an ""unlawful assembly"" at 7:14 p.m. and ordered people to disperse. By 7:40 p.m., police said one person had been arrested. Demonstrators could be heard chanting, ""No justice, no peace,"" and drivers honked car horns as they drove by. Protesters were seen running away in many directions as police moved them back. The crowds reformed along Southwest Fourth Avenue in two separate spots north and south of Alder, along the waterfront and at Northwest Third and Burnside outside the Union Gospel Mission. Protesters were seen throwing items as the 8 p.m. curfew began. TriMet stopped all transit service in the downtown area. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency and has imposed a curfew on the city after destructive protests Friday night and early Saturday morning damaged downtown businesses and set fire to the Justice Center. The curfew, which began at 8 p.m. Saturday, lasts until 6 a.m. Sunday. Under the curfew, most residents are prohibited from travelling on any public streets.

Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Portland Saturday night for the second consecutive night of protests, less than a full day after Friday's initial, peaceful protests turned into rioting and looting until dawn. Tribune reporter Zane Sparling and photojournalist Jonathan House stayed on the scene as Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's 8 p.m. curfew went into effect. Sparling described pandemonium in Waterfront Park as police fired rounds of tear gas at fleeing protesters. Officers also deployed flash bangs and rubber bullets earlier in the day, while clearing out several parks near City Hall. Police in full riot gear ordered crowds to ""go home now"" as loudhailers boomed through the night. Protesters spray-painted obscenities on downtown stores, as they had the night before. Widespread looting, however, was not reported during the Saturday, May 30 event. The Portland Police Bureau announced 48 arrests by early Sunday, saying clusters of protesters had been ordered to disperse both in the central city and near Lloyd Center mall across the Willamette River in Northeast Portland. ""We fully support the right to protest peacefully, and we are committed to protecting that right,"" said Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese, ""but when those who choose to committ criminal activity put other lives and properties at risk, we must do everything we can to keep our community safe."" While members of the news media were expressly exempted from Mayor Wheeler's curfew, several members of the media, including journalist Sergio Olmos, reported being told to leave by officers. ""Though media is exempt from curfew, we want to remind you to obey all orders from officers during the demonstration,"" police later said in a tweet. ""If officers are asking crowds to disperse, then you must also."" Similar protests took place throughout the nation — including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. The unrest was prompted by the in-custody murder of Minneapolis man George Floyd. Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, planted a knee in Floyd's neck while arresting him for nearly nine minutes. Floyd, on a widely distributed video, could be heard saying, ""I can't breathe."" He died of suffocation. Chauvin has been fired and arrested on charges of third-degree murder.",0.0

The protest followed a peaceful vigil honoring the life of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police in Minneapolis this week. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) declared it a riot late Friday night. Police arrested 13 people in connection to the protest, on charges of rioting, theft, disorderly conduct, and interfering with a police officer. According to PPB, two officers and one protestor sustained minor injuries, and at least one shooting occurred in connection with the protest. At a press conference Saturday morning, Wheeler noted that the “scale of the damage” from Friday’s protest was “not something we’re familiar with here in Portland.” He also acknowledged that the protest “did not happen in a vacuum.” “I don’t condone what happened in Portland last night… [but] this isn’t just about damage or graffiti or fires or broken storefronts or lost product,” he added. “We have to honestly acknowledge that yesterday’s events boiled over into anger and frustration and rage all across this great nation.” In a press release announcing the state of emergency, Wheeler also issued a curfew beginning 8 pm Saturday evening and ending at 6 am Sunday morning. The curfew prohibits people from traveling throughout the city, with exemptions for first responders and people experiencing emergencies or houselessness. Violations are punishable ""by criminal prosecution,"" per the press release. City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty strongly denounced the protest at the press conference. “[The protest] was merely a small group of people who decided that, here’s a great opportunity for us to steal stuff and break stuff. I want those people prosecuted,” she said. “We can help Black people, but we don’t have to destroy our city to do it.” Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said Friday night “will go down in history as one of the worst nights in Portland,” and noted that “in the coming days we’ll be increase our police presence.” E.D. Mondaine, head of the Portland NAACP chapter, also denounced the protest’s activities at the press conference. “The self-concern, the casual destruction, and the self-righteous determination to put others in harm’s way… does absolutely nothing to honor the legacy of George Floyd, or improve the systemic problems that led to his murder,” he said. “To our non-Black allies, do not commit violence in our names.” Portland was one of many United States cities that had intense protests Friday night in response to Floyd’s death.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that 'my administration will stop mob violence and we'll stop it cold.' Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, May 25. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) LOS ANGELES (AP) — A fourth day of violence in Los Angeles prompted the mayor to impose a rare citywide curfew and call in the National Guard after demonstrators clashed repeatedly with officers, torched police vehicles and pillaged businesses in a popular shopping district. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Saturday he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. The Guard members were expected to arrive early Sunday. Garcetti said the soldiers would be deployed “to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city.” Firefighters responded to dozens of fires, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was the area around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the area, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. One officer suffered a fractured skull, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said. When the curfew took effect at 8 p.m., police moved aggressively to get people off the streets and there was no repeat of the late-night rampage that occurred downtown Friday night and led to more than 500 arrests. Community leaders denounced the violence that has accompanied protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who was died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck. Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn said she lived through two previous seminal LA race riots — Watts in 1965 and 1992 following the acquittal of police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King — and remembers the pain the city endured. “We must stand in solidarity against the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement,” she said. “But please don’t destroy our beloved Los Angeles. This is not a protest anymore.” There were protests in cities throughout California, from San Diego to San Francisco. San Francisco’s iconic Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria’s Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said a citywide curfew would go into effect from 8 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. She also asked the governor to put the National Guard on standby. “People are hurting right now. They’re angry. I’m angry,” Breed tweeted, “We can’t tolerate violence and vandalism.” San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said he understood why protesters are angry at police. But he warned that if anyone assaulted officers, “we will not tolerate that.” In nearby Oakland, which was wracked by violence Friday night that left 13 officers injured, authorities declared an unlawful demonstration near City Hall late Saturday. Protesters lit a dumpster on fire in the middle of an intersection and police launched tear gas into a crowd. In Emeryville, just east of San Francisco, Mayor Christian Patz said Target, Best Buy and other box stores were burglarized, with thieves stealing electronics and other items. Stores in the city closed early Saturday as part of a shelter-in-place order following violent protests in nearby Oakland the night before. “It’s an explosion of the frustration of the people in the community,” Patz said, “If we’re going to ask people to stay within the bounds of the law, we’re going to have to show that the law applies to everyone.” In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, hundreds of demonstrators converged on the police station, throwing objects and setting off firecrackers as police used tear gas to push them back. The scale of the destruction in Los Angeles was being compared to the 1992 riots, when there was more than $1 billion in property damage. There was no estimate of how many businesses suffered damage since protests began Wednesday, but it was clearly extensive. Saturday’s clashes occurred in and near the Fairfax District, where the historic center of LA’s Jewish community mixes with upscale shopping, restaurants and entertainment industry sites that draw locals and tourists from around the world. CBS Television City, the quaint Original Farmer’s Market and the luxury of the Grove are among sights. Trendy Melrose Avenue, which lent its name to the TV show “Melrose Place,” runs through the neighborhood. The rally that preceded the violence was held at Pan-Pacific Park, former site of the 1930s-era Pan-Pacific Auditorium where LA’s professional sports teams played and many of its major events were held before the city’s modern arenas were built. Through the day, crowds of demonstrators faced off with lines of police officers, or broke into businesses and stole merchandise. Patrol cars were battered and set ablaze, and several businesses burned into the night. The huge crowds gradually dissipated, but officers still pursued scattered groups and individuals. On Friday night, protesters roamed through the downtown late at night, smashing windows and robbing jewelry and other stores. On Saturday, a mostly peaceful demonstration early in the day devolved in the afternoon when protesters set several police department cars on fire, broke store windows and climbed on top of a bus. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. “We cannot allow this city to spiral into anarchy,” Moore told ABC7 at the scene of one clash. Garcetti initially imposed a curfew on the downtown area. But he quickly expanded it to the entirety of the city as the violence focused on an area about 6 miles (10 kilometers) to the west. Adjacent Beverly Hills and West Hollywood followed as demonstrations spread into those cities. Other cities in the county also began imposing curfews. Social media video posts showed marchers chanting “Eat the rich” in Beverly Hills, where a crowd broke into a high-end boutique and fled with merchandise. The governor said earlier that authorities were closely monitoring organizing by violent extremist groups who may be trying to use the protests for their own agendas. “To those who seek to exploit Californians’ pain to sow chaos and destruction, you are not welcome,” he said. “Our state and nation must build from this moment united and more resolved than ever to address racism and its root causes.” In Oakland, a federal contract security officer was killed and another critically injured Friday night when a vehicle pulled up to the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and someone opened fire. The officers guard the U.S. courthouse as part of their regular duties and were monitoring the protest, Department of Homeland Security officials said. It wasn’t immediately known whether the shooter had anything to do with the protest. “This is not who we are,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a videotaped statement Saturday. “We must fight the travesty of racism, but we must do it in a way that works. Let’s not destroy or harm our own community.” The death of the 46-year-old Floyd, who was recorded on video pleading for air, has shocked the country and produced violence in numerous cities. Police chiefs and police unions have called it unjustifiable and excessive force. The officer has been charged with murder",0.0

Jay Inslee activated the National Guard following rowdy protests that spilled onto Interstate 5, forcing the freeway's closure through the central part of the Northwest's largest city. Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle in the rain to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. A largely peaceful demonstration turned rowdier Saturday afternoon, with police deploying flash bangs to disperse crowds. Police also pepper-sprayed demonstrators who got close to police lines, and officers on bicycles pushed back several protesters. The Washington State Patrol closed both directions of Interstate 5 through the city between Interstate 90 and Highway 520. Protesters marched through the lanes of the freeway. ""The freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration,"" state patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement. News footage showed at least one destroyed police cruiser, other vehicle fires and people breaking into retail stores and other businesses. A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Lauren Truscott, said some people were arrested, though she didn't have an exact figure. Durkan hastily announced a curfew to begin at 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday and to last through 5 a.m. in response to the protests. Inslee soon after said he had activated up to 200 members of the Washington National Guard in response to a request from the city to help protect property, manage crowds and traffic. Guard personnel will be unarmed and work under the direction of city leadership, the statement from the governor's office said. ""The National Guard is on stand by to assist the Seattle Police Department as requested by Mayor Durkan,"" Inslee said. ""They will only be utilized if absolutely necessary and we appreciate their efforts to help in this important work."" Residents should remain in their homes ""to the extent possible"" and not travel in or through Seattle, said Durkan, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best and Seattle Fire Department Chief Harold Scoggins in a statement released about 4:45 p.m. ""This curfew is intended to prevent violence and widespread property damage, and to prevent the further community spread of COVID-19 through continued gathering,"" they said. The tense scenes in Seattle followed a violent night in Portland, Oregon, where authorities said those responsible for the damage to police headquarters, a shopping mall and many businesses will be tracked down. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also imposed a state of emergency and a curfew, which was to resume Saturday at 8 p.m. and lift at 6 a.m. Sunday. Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone, who is African American, said the anger and violence is not only about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but a system that allows people of color to ""feel fear every day."" ""This is a moment of reckoning,"" Boone said at a news conference with other city leaders. ""We are going forward, together, to create an actual community where respect and dignity are our core values."" Jo Ann Hardesty, an African American member of the City Council, said those responsible for the looting and burning were a small group of people who took the opportunity of earlier peaceful protests — that police had largely stayed away from — ""to steal stuff and break stuff."" ""We can get justice for black people, but we don't have to destroy our community to do it,"" Hardesty said. She offered to help identify rioters from video images so they could be arrested and prosecuted. In the past, Portland has seen numerous violent protests, often between far-right demonstrators and those opposed to them. Community activists have told police their heavy presence can be a trigger for violence. Their presence was light as peaceful protests started Friday. The People of Color Caucus of the Oregon Legislature called the rioters opportunists and outliers who were disregarding the leadership of black community organizers. At one point, black community members placed themselves between a business and vandals to protect it from being destroyed, they said. ""We are just beginning to lay plans to reopen and these actions are destructive to our efforts as we try to weave together what COVID-19 has already torn apart,"" the nine lawmakers said. A man in a car was grazed by a bullet, believed to have been fired by a protester, and he was treated and released from a hospital, police said. ""No one could have predicted what we saw last night,"" Acting Police Chief Chris Davis said at the news conference. ""It's extremely difficult to predict where we're going to have this kind of violence."" Two police officers were injured by a thrown incendiary device and a rock. Blazes continued to burn early Saturday morning in multiple locations downtown — including a building that housed a bank — and broken glass littered the streets. Portland police arrested at least 13 people before dawn Saturday. Seattle police were reviewing the use of force in one of at least seven arrests Friday night. Durkan and Best told a Friday evening news conference they were outraged by the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck. They also implored protesters to be peaceful Durkan said the killing reflects the ""deep and systemic racism"" in the United States. Selsky reported from Salem.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let's light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff by the 260-foot rocket, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoon just in time. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. His crewmate batted around a sparkly purplish toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly. Bridenstine pronounced it “just an amazing day.” “It’s been nine years since we’ve launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil — and now it’s done. We have done it. It’s been way too long,” he said. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the launch attempt for the second time in four days. “I’m so proud of the people at NASA, all the people that worked together, public and private. When you see a sight like that it’s incredible,” Trump said after liftoff. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers wore masks and were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Saturday's flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement, Bridenstine said. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Saturday's first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks.",0.0

'This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it's not just in the U.S. "" London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps 'irresponsible' when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death "" the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America "" have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. 'There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union.' ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.' The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. 'We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,' she said. 'As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.' Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting 'No justice! No peace!' while carrying signs reading 'Justice for George Floyd' and 'Racism is a global issue.' Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: 'Justice for George Floyd.' Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area "" inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 "" will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation's state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. 'We have almost reached safe harbor,' Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that 'nothing will return as before.' That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that 'the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.' ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

George Floyd, 46, died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he begged for breath before he lost consciousness. When paramedics arrived, he had no pulse and was unresponsive. Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday, but not before outraged residents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul demonstrated through the night, plunging the cities into unrest and chaos. The protests have spread across the nation, with groups taking to the streets from New York to California and Colorado to Florida to Atlanta. Some of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but others have led to vandalism and confrontations with police. In Portland, two groups marched peacefully through the city with dozens of police in tow blocking traffic and clearing a path for the demonstrators. The first group assembled after 3 p.m. before City Hall, marched to the Portland police station on Middle Street, and then to Monument Square before dispersing without incident around 5 p.m. Simultaneously, another group of demonstrators blocked Franklin Street near Whole Foods for about an hour before moving to the intersection of Congress Street and High Street, shutting down what is typically one of the city’s busiest intersections. Demonstrators dispersed by about 8 p.m., and there were no signs of violence or arrests. In 2016, Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched through Portland after two black men were shot and killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. That protest generated more than a dozen arrests, but no one was arrested during the demonstrations on Friday, and police cleared traffic and stood by as demonstrators hurled insults at them and chanted profanities. One of the demonstrators who attended the Monument Square rally, Raymond Diamond, 24, carried a white sign painted in flowing black letters that asked, “could it have been me?” Diamond said he grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a history of slavery, racism and oppression began before the nation’s independence and continues in subtler forms today. Although Diamond said he senses less racial tension overall in Maine, he fears he could one day be the victim of police violence simply for being black. His fear of police began when he was about 14 or 15, when Diamond watched from the passenger seat as a police officer pulled over his mother in their own neighborhood, eventually making the traffic stop in their own driveway, he said. Someone must have thought they didn’t belong there, Diamond recalled. He still remembers his mother’s anger, and her warning to him afterward. “She told me to be careful and to protect myself and to do what I had to do to come home, so she isn’t one of those mothers crying on the news,” he said. “With a history like what we have, I’m not surprised this is where we are. The police are a reflection of the state. That’s not something that we can get around.” Ahead of the local demonstrations in Portland, the Portland police chief and leaders of two labor unions representing officers released a letter to the community to say they were disturbed by Floyd’s death and the way his arrest was handled. But the local police leaders – who collectively have several decades of policing experience – did not say in the written statement released Friday whether they believe the officer should face criminal prosecution. Some police leaders around the country condemned the death as nothing short of murder, and by midday Friday, Chauvin was charged by a local prosecutor and taken into custody. He faces one count of third-degree murder and one count of manslaughter. Floyd was initially detained Monday by Minneapolis police because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. The statement on Friday from Portland’s chief of police, Frank Clark, was co-signed by Officer Les Smith and Sgt. Eric Nevins, who lead the patrol and supervisors’s unions, respectively. The police leaders expressed sorrow and frustration at Floyd’s death, and said they believe the professionalism, training and rigorous hiring standards in Portland mean there is little to no chance of a similar episode occurring in Maine. “You should know that the Portland Police Department has policies and strategies in place in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening here,” the letter said. “Our policies and training prohibit neck type restraints. They also call for our officers’ use of force to be in response to an actual or imminent threat.” The letter did not include a copy of the department’s use-of-force policy; the department has not responded to a request for a copy of the policy. In an interview early Friday afternoon, Clark said he and every other member of the department who has spoken to him about Floyd’s death has been taken aback by Chauvin’s actions, calling it “unacceptable.” “My first reaction was what if that was my brother or father or son?” Clark said. “To say it was disturbing is probably an understatement. I immediately think of the impact, wherever it is in the country, I think of the impact it’s going to have in our department and among our officers and in our community.” “Never say never, but one of the other initial reactions I had was that would not happen here,” Clark said. “That would not happen here in Maine or in the city of Portland.” Smith, the president of the local Police Benevolent Association, has more than 30 years on the job, and for the last decade has taught self defense and use-of-force classes to Portland’s officers at the state’s only police academy, in Vassalboro. “My first reaction was that (Chauvin) was not taught that at any academy and he was not taught that at the police department,” Smith said. “Our whole goal is to use just enough force to protect the officer, keep the suspect safe, and keep the civilian safe. From the perspective I saw in the video, it just seemed it was out of line. It was way, way too much.” Smith continued: “Its very frustrating to watch that happen. I put my heart and my soul into my training, and the Portland Police Department does the same. We take it very seriously. So when I see this, I take it to heart, when someone isn’t doing what they should be doing.” The death is the latest in a history of police-involved killings that stretches back years, in which mostly minority men have died at the hands of police. Some of the cases have resulted in prosecutions, while many have not. Police officers enjoy special legal protections while they perform their duties, which often include controlled acts of violence that are permitted in order to bring someone under control, or to protect themselves or bystanders. In many communities across the country and especially during the post-slavery Jim Crow era, police embodied the use of state power to reinforce a racial hierarchy and oppress non-white citizens. Although Maine does not have a deep history of Jim Crow-era oppression, black people in Maine still see disparate treatment by police, the courts and in schools, according to the ACLU of Maine. “Police departments around the country have been silent about the unnecessary killings of black people for far too long, so we are glad the Portland Police Department made this public statement,” said Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine. Black children in Maine face more discipline, expulsions, suspensions and arrests at school than their white peers. Black residents have also documented ill treatment by private businesses, and in March, a 38-year-old Biddeford man was found guilty on federal hate-crime charges for his role in two unprovoked attacks on black men in Portland and Biddeford. Most recently, black Mainers suffer a far greater impact from the COVID-19 pandemic than white people, Beyea said, echoing a national trend, despite Maine’s relatively small non-white population. “We wish the PPD and all Maine law enforcement would recognize and condemn the systemic racism that makes these killings so commonplace. Policies and protocols and training are important, but they won’t stop people from being killed until we address the root of the problem,” Beyea wrote. “It will take all of us acknowledging and fighting against racism to prevent the next tragic incident from happening here,” she said. Police training in recent years has evolved to acknowledge that racism and unintentional bias play a role in how everyone views others and makes decisions, including police officers, and anti-bias training is now part of Portland’s training regimen and is reinforced through rotating classes that all Maine police officers must complete annually to maintain their certification.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Portland joined cities across the country where unrest and riots have occurred in the fallout from the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in a Minneapolis police officer's custody. A march through the streets of Portland in protest of Floyd's death turned into a riot late Friday night and into the early morning hours of Saturday. The evening started with a vigil at North Portland's Peninsula Park, where hundreds of people gathered to honor Floyd, and other black men and women killed by police officers nationwide. The group began marching around 9 p.m. down Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, chanting: ""black lives matter,"" ""no justice, no peace,"" and ""I can't breathe,"" in reference to Floyd's plead while a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his throat. Some individuals broke from the group and vandalized businesses along MLK Boulevard, leaving broken glass and graffiti. Police say graffiti went on for about 20 blocks. Just before 10 p.m. police say a protester shot at an occupied car at NE 7th Avenue and Morris Street. One person inside the car was treated for a graze wound, and has since been released from the hospital. The march eventually got to downtown, where demonstrators broke into and set fire inside the Multnomah County Justice Center, which houses hundreds of inmates. Several fires were set throughout downtown, in dumpsters, trash cans, cars and pallets at SW 4th Avenue and Alder Street. Businesses throughout downtown were vandalized and looted -- including stores at Pioneer Place Mall -- and the demonstration was quickly deemed a riot. Police used tear gas, flashbangs, and other uses of force to try to disperse people. At SW 4th Avenue and Yamhill Street, Portland police say their cars were smashed by protesters armed with electric scooters. Two officers were injured during the riots; one was hit by an ""incendiary device"" and a Portland Police Criminalist was hit in the head with a rock. Both are expected to be OK. Around 3:30 a.m. Saturday, Portland police say about 30 demonstrators surrounded a car at SW 3rd Avenue and Main Streets. Police closed the area to traffic and allowed the driver to back out of the crowd, but they refused. They were arrested and issued a criminal citation. Early Saturday morning, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler pleaded with demonstrators to end the destruction. As he saw the vandalism continue, Wheeler, who was out of town caring for his sick mother, returned to Portland and held a news conference Saturday morning alongside other city leaders. ""I cannot condone last night's violence, I can't stand by and watch our city be destroyed, buildings set aflame. I won't. But nor will I stand silent as men like George Floyd are murdered by the very institutions that are supposed to protect and serve them,"" Wheeler said. As of 5 a.m. Saturday, 13 people were arrested overnight in connection with the riot: William L.

Friday night's march and vigil was organized by the activist group PNW Youth Liberation Front to show solidarity with Minneapolis protesters and demand justice for Floyd's death. Organizers asked attendees to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hundreds of people, spread out across the park, showed up to honor Floyd. The vigil was filled with about three hours of speakers. “We stand with the grieving family of George,” said Rev. Roy Tate of Christ Memorial Community Church while addressing the crowd. “Those who are in Minneapolis, we stand tonight with them.” “I know what happened in Minneapolis, but we have our own situations here in Portland,” said pastor Dwight Minniweather of New Liberation Christian Church. “They’re not as crucial but they still need to be addressed.” Earlier on Friday, the NAACP led a peaceful gathering in the afternoon called ""A Eulogy from Black America."" On Friday, authorities announced that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested in connection with Floyd's death. Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder, but authorities are continuing to review evidence and there may be further charges later. Many in attendance at Friday night's vigil said they appreciated news of Chauvin’s arrest, but only to a degree.",0.0

Bill Clinton was a lame-duck president. The Florida Supreme Court was hearing arguments on a recount of votes for George W. Bush and Al Gore, and the next president was still up in the air. Destiny’s Child, Madonna, Mya, and *Nsync were all in the Billboard top 10. The youngest baby boomers were nearing 40, and millennials weren’t old enough to get into bars yet without a top-notch fake ID; it was Generation X’s world. And the music calendar in six-month-old weekly the Portland Mercury was packed. “I can tell you Jackstraw would have been Tuesdays, the Prairie Dogs Fridays. Velvida Underground had a night, and the Freak Mountain Ramblers played Saturdays,” says singer-songwriter James Low, reciting from memory most of the regular happy hour acts at his favorite hangout of that era, the LaurelThirst Public House, where Low was still doing a monthly happy hour in 2020 before the coronavirus shutdown. Some other venues he played back then weren’t as long-lived: the Green Room in Northwest and Snake & Weasel in Ladd’s Addition. The Aislers Set played the old Meow Meow on Friday, December 1, 2000. Image: Courtesy Margaret Seiler A friend’s “Have I seen any bands that start with A?” question this spring on Facebook (she was doing one of those alphabetical list challenges) prompted me to double-check it was San Fran indie band the Aislers Set that had opened for Bratmobile at the old Meow Meow on my first trip to Portland, when I shared a bunk with a woman who kept eating chicken in her bed at the Hawthorne Hostel, admired locals’ coats at the Holiday Ale Fest, and caught some jammier bands at the LaurelThirst. It might have been that Velvida Underground night—perhaps I sat near Low, who at the moment has switched his regular happy hour online (along with his student-teacher gig for a Tigard elementary school while he works toward his MAT at Western Oregon University—like many long-term performers in town, he figured education might make for a good steady gig). Thanks to the Mercury and the internet, I found my answer (yes, that Meow Meow show ticked off A and B in my own alphabetical challenge), but I also found a ton of names that still appear on local bar sandwich boards and music calendars—or did, up until measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 closed everything down. Let’s dive in. The beginning of the Mercury’s music calendar, November 30, 2000 (red lines added for closed venues) Image: Portlandmercury.com Rootsy guitarist and singer-songwriter Maria Webster played Thursday night at 52nd Avenue Sports Bar, which still sits on NE Sandy Boulevard today but rarely has live music, just karaoke. The show at the Ash Street Saloon (which closed in 2017) included the Cosmos Group, with onetime Willamette Week music writer Dewey Mahood. Openers The Planet The would release albums of their own in 2003 and 2005. And Reeks & the Wraiths—aw, man, I knew that sounded familiar. It included Orion Satushek, who was also in Spooky Dance Band, and who would be killed in a grisly, multi-fatality accident in 2003, when a repeat drunk driver on a suspended license hit a group of cyclists on SE Belmont. (The driver died last July, three-quarters of the way into a 20-year sentence.) Betty Already played Thursday, November 30, 2000, at Berbati’s Pan. Image: Courtesy Margaret Seiler At Berbati’s Pan (the venue would close 10 years later, at the end of 2010, shortly after the death of owner Ted Papaioannou at age 56), Lisa Marsicek was performing with Betty Already and was about to start Miz Kitty’s Parlour vaudeville show. It’s still running, though the April 18 show planned for the Old Church was canceled. Also now closed are the Blue Note (its West Burnside space was most recently Nick Zukin’s Zapapizza), Brasserie Montmartre (closed 2006, open again in 2009, closed in 2011, reopened 2012, closed for good 2015 and now home to Park Avenue Fine Wines), and Candlelight Cafe and Bar (razed in 2012 to make way for TriMet’s Orange Line MAX). Candlelight regular Norman Sylvester was as busy as ever with regular gigs into 2020, until COVID-19 put the kibosh on his regular nights at places like the Spare Room, Clyde’s Prime Rib, and Catfish Lou’s. I’m guessing the show at the Crystal Ballroom is really OB Addy with his band I&I, and not Obo Addy, his uncle, an Accra native and celebrated Ghanaian drummer and Lewis & Clark professor who founded Homowo, an African arts and culture nonprofit. Or maybe the uncle and nephew, whose disputes would reach the courts a few years later, were temporarily on good terms and playing a show together. But I doubt it. Obo Addy died in 2012. Tapas restaurant and late-night dance spot Fernando’s Hideaway closed in 2007, but Toshi Onizuka was still playing regularly at places like El Gaucho before the coronavirus shutdown began. Hoppers Blue Bar on outer SE Division drew many noise complaints in the early 2000s. It’s now a cannabis dispensary. Old Town’s long-running Jazz de Opus closed in 2003; the strip club that now occupies its space was, for a while, offering “DancerDash” food delivery during the COVID-19 closure. The final show at the legendary Jimmy Mak’s was on the last night of 2016; owner Jimmy Makarounis died from cancer of the larynx two days later (what is it with Portland’s club owners of Greek ancestry being taken too soon?), while drummer and national treasure Mel Brown’s most recent scheduled show was March 8: an afternoon gig on the coast for Nehalem’s Winterfest. The November 30 Kells performer, Winterfolk founder Tom May, is still around, and so is the Irish pub, though its St. Patrick’s blowout had to be canceled this year. The LaurelThirst lineup that night included blues musician Robert Cannon, who appears to now co-own a brewery in his native Mitchell in Central Oregon, and Velvida Underground featuring Trashcan Joe—still a regular performer on the McMenamins circuit before the chain essentially shuttered during the pandemic. Lewis & Clark College and its Evans Music Center endure. NE Alberta Street’s Medicine Hat is now Trade-Up Music, but on this night in 2000 it hosted an Olympia-rich lineup of Enemymine, Bastinado, and Mood Swings. The members of Finnish death metal band Noumena stretched their time in Portland, hitting the Mount Tabor Theater (now Quarterworld, the arcade that’s renting out some of its machines during the COVID-19 closure) on Thursday and the Ash Street on Sunday. The Rabbit Hole & Mad Hatter Lounge is now the two-level Elvis Room. McMenamins’ Rock Creek Tavern performers Eric Schweiterman and John Becher are still making music around town, Becher playing with the Resolectrics on the pre-coronavirus McMenamins circuit. San Diego Christian nu metal group P.O.D. took the Roseland’s stage November 30. As of May, the long-running band’s summer 2020 European tour had not been canceled. Legendary Chinatown punk club Satyricon was visited that night by Sylous, a Portlander who would later also perform under the name My Darling Boy. Ladd’s Addition coffeehouse Snake & Weasel is long gone. The St. Johns Pub is still there, but McMenamins would later switch its domed theater (built as an exhibit hall for the 1905 Lewis & Clark Exposition and later barged downriver to St. Johns) from primarily a music venue to yet another cinema. Part of the Mount Tabor Theatre, the Tabor Acoustic Room shuttered when Jason Sabala took over the venue and pumped up the rock factor. The Touchstone Café was in a little red building on NE Glisan in Montavilla. The Twilight (the one on Powell, not Lombard), the White Eagle, Wilf’s at Union Station (performer John Gilmore is also a piano tuner/technician), and Eugene’s Woodmen of the World Hall were all still hosting music this year before the shutdown. A selection of shows from Friday, December 1, 2000 Image: Portlandmercury.com It was surely a loud night at the Ash Street thanks to Lopez, a punk-rock band originally from Wenatchee that would go on to share members with Gaytheist and bills with Red Fang. Busy Jerry Joseph, who played a CD release show at Berbati’s Pan for 2000’s Everything Is Beautiful and whose huge New Year’s Eve shows are still a Portland tradition, had to cancel spring shows this year due to the coronavirus closures, as well as a European tour with Drive-By Truckers this summer. Jerry Joseph played a CD release show at Berbati’s. Image: Courtesy Nyssa Perrin Clark Borders Books & Music, which once anchored downtown’s Mohawk Building, went out of business in 2011. Born in 1925, Brasserie Montmartre staple Eddie Wied had gone to Lewis & Clark College and then Juilliard before eventually returning to Portland and becoming a fixture at the Jazz Quarry downtown and the Hobbit in Southeast, playing with the likes of Mel Brown and Leroy Vinnegar. Known as “The Professor,” Wied died in 2007. Portland band Smooch Knob (a record company website claims the name is a reference to a knob on a car steering wheel to ease one-handed operation and not what my inner teenage boy thought it was) played at Frank Faillace’s Cobalt Lounge, in the Old Town stumble zone at NW Third Avenue and Couch. It would become the Dixie Tavern in 2005, one of the few 21st-century new businesses outside of the South to use Dixie in its name. (SE Belmont Street’s unrelated Dixie Mattress, which is also the title of a Jerry Joseph song, closed in 2010.) Already something of a riot grrrl reunion act in 2000, Bratmobile played the Meow Meow Friday, at the all-ages club’s original SE Pine Street location (now event space Union/Pine). Today, front woman Allison Wolfe is 50 and has a podcast. Also on the bill were the Aislers Set (who had their own reunion tour in 2014) and The Tennessee Twin (Wolfe’s twin sister, Cindy, in fact, and not the current British country duo of the same name). Bratmobile played the old Meow Meow on December 1. Image: Courtesy Sarah Fan The Sassy magazine subscription I’d had 10 years before guaranteed I was in the Meow Meow crowd that night to raise a glass to Bratmobile guitarist Erin Smith, onetime Sassy intern and the teen magazine’s “Washington bureau chief.” So I missed my chance to see the not-yet-megafamous White Stripes (their breakout White Blood Cells album would come out the following year and see a major-label rerelease in 2002, and Jack Black would record his “Portland, Oregon” duet with her majesty Loretta Lynn in 2004) and the already-infamous Fireballs of Freedom the same night at Satyricon. “We had our normal, Portland kind of EJ’s fallout, drunken partier dude fest,” Fireballs singer and guitarist Kelly Gately said this April by phone from Minneapolis, where he and his wife moved in 2016 and where he’d been furloughed from his bartending job. “The Fireballs had a great set. A ton of our friends were there; it was kind of a rowdy, drunken blowout. I remember Jack White coming up to me as we were loading our gear off the stage, and he was like, ‘Thanks so much for playing these shows,’ and he was just a really humble, super-sweet dude, and he said, ‘Man, it really sucks having to follow you guys.’ I was sort of flattered, but then in a way, you know, I don’t think he meant so much the craftsmanship of our songs necessarily but more the dynamic and the volume.” The show was part of a weekend-long tour that also took the bands to Seattle and Vancouver. “They definitely had a pretty big buzz, kind of an underground following, but I didn’t realize how insane of a following,” says Gately. “The shows were attended like crazy, packed out all weekend. I remember being taken aback at how many new faces were there, kind of a younger generation looking for something a little different than, you know, your ’90s noisy garage stuff.” Gately also remember that fat envelope of cash the White Stripes got at the end of the night and the thin one for the Fireballs. “Mike Thrasher, rest in peace, was settling out with us, and he handed us our envelope ... we were getting like $200. We had the same booking agent, the White Stripes and the Fireballs did. We all kind of met eyes, and Mike was like, ‘You guys really need to talk to your agent, have him restructure your guarantee....’” A selection of shows from Saturday, December 2, 2000 Image: Portlandmercury.com Dante’s regulars Black Angel, with the vocals of J. R. Pella and Tahoe Jackson, lent their soul sound to a benefit show at Berbati’s on Saturday, December 2. (Jackson was also in Hungry Mob, which played the night before at Old Town electronica dance hall Ohm, which closed in 2009 after issues with the police and OLCC.) A long-renowned educator and mentor, trumpeter Thara Memory, who played Jimmy Mak’s this night with his Super Band, would die in 2017 under the shadow of sex abuse and harassment charges. The Freedom Funk Ensemble played Friday at Ohm in Old Town and Saturday at the Mount Tabor Pub. Image: Courtesy Margaret Seiler Dee Settlemeir, part of Mad Hattie, which played the LaurelThirst December 1, is now playing vaudevillian jazz with the Libertine Belles and works as a licensed acupuncturist. Local multi-instrumentalist Kaitlyn ni Donovan had just started playing with dream pop band the High Violets, and they had a show at Meow Meow Saturday night with the Prids, who had moved to town the year before. Freedom Funk Ensemble, which also played the night before at Ohm, appeared at Mount Tabor. Rachel Browning played Saturday night on a bill with Trespassers William, who saw some of their songs used in Felicity, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, One Tree Hill, and The O.C. Browning doesn’t remember much about the SoCal-by-way-of-Seattle band that night, but she does remember her band’s weekly shows at the Rabbit Hole & Mad Hatter Lounge—her favorite place in that era to unleash her “alt-country with a minor twang,” she says. “Back then Portland was really known for that kind of music, roots-inspired stuff, and we were part of that whole scene.” At the Rabbit Hole, Browning says, “The staff were all wonderful, and they had these incredible sweet potato fries, which they used as a way of luring people to the shows.” She says the staff told her they always had to order more beer on her regular weekly nights there. In the decade that followed, Browning says, “I got married, I had a baby, I got divorced, things were hard, and there was a recession.” Today, she’s working from home during the pandemic as the general manager of Salvage Works, the building supply company she and her brother Preston opened in 2010 “in the midst of the recession, because neither of us could get a job.” (Also a musician, Preston played mandolin and sang in Fescu 911, which played the LaurelThirst and Duffy’s—now the St. Johns Pub—in the ’90s.) On Satyricon’s stage, Saturday saw King Black Acid, already recording on Portland’s Cavity Search Records and soon to embark on a steady career creating music for films and TV commercials, and the well-connected Luther Russell. The still-busy Caleb Klauder, also of long-running Calobo, was at McMenamins’ White Eagle. A selection of shows from Sunday and Monday, December 2 and 3, 2000 Image: Portlandmercury.com Biddy McGraw’s opened on SE Hawthorne in the ’90s and had recently moved to NE Glisan and 60th when Earl and the Reggae Allstars played there on Sunday night. (Later known as the O'Neill Pub, it closed in January 2019.) Bandleader Earl Marson is also the SewingMan, a tailor with a shop on NE Killingsworth Street today. “We played around Portland, Saturday Market, all over the place,” says Marson, who still works on solo music projects on garage band in addition to tailoring. “But the music industry in Portland changed. It got tougher. You know Portland’s changed, Reggae kind of got pushed to the back seat, plus I stopped performing for a while.” Marson says it’s been a few years since the last Allstars show. Club 21-goers that night enjoyed a cover band of Norwegian deathpunk legends Turbonegro, called the Denim Demons. The little gnome house on NE Sandy and 21st closed in 2017 and was demolished to make way for a six-story apartment building. Sunday’s act at Jazz de Opus, Dan Balmer, was also busy before the coronavirus shutdown. “I was playing three or four or five nights a week, as I have for the past 40 years. I play every Monday at Jo Bar in Northwest Portland, and every Thursday at the Jack London with the Mel Brown B3 organ group,” says Balmer, a guitarist, composer, bandleader, and educator who teaches at Lewis & Clark College. “Weekends, there’s a bunch of different groups I play with, and I do private events. But nobody’s as busy as they were in the ’90s and ’80s. Partly, Portland has become less of a jazz town.” Balmer points to a lot of reasons there are fewer jazz clubs today, like the aging of fans and the rise of new genres, but he says there are still supportive bar owners and crowds at places like the 1905 off N Mississippi, the Jack London Revue, the Teutonic Wine Company, and Christo’s in Salem. “It used to be there would be a string of names that come right off my tongue. I played at Jimmy Mak’s three nights a week for 13 years. That was one of the best jazz clubs in the world,” says Balmer. “The McMenamins are a power player,“ Balmer notes, when I observe that some of the regional chain’s venues have had some of the same names on their music calendars for decades. “If they liked jazz”—or at least if McMenamins bookers relied on jazz the same was they seem to rely on rootsy and old-time acts—“the world would be much different.” Local institution the Freak Mountain Ramblers (regulars at LaurelThirst and one of those rootsy bands that found a lot of work with McMenamins) lost core member Jimmy Boyer to cancer in 2016. The Meow Meow bill on Sunday included the sludgy hard rock of Last of the Juanitas, a longtime Portland band originally from Arizona who released albums on Montana’s Wantage USA label. Back in Arizona, today one of its members runs a record store in Tucson. Jazz guitarist John Stowell, who played at Brasserie Montmartre Monday, December 4, was busy with performances this year before coronavirus closed things down. Hair metal band Ratt, whose biggest hit, “Round and Round,” came out in 1984, made a stop Monday at Crystal Ballroom on its reunion tour. (The group has since splintered amid trademark disputes, with some version of it appearing in a recent Geico commercial.) Karaoke From Hell was still at Dante’s every Monday (plus a few other regular spots on other nights) into March 2020. Drummer, bandleader, and Portland native Ron Steen, who played at Produce Row on this night in 2000, was still plying his nearly four-decade-old Jazz Jam at Clyde’s Prime Rib and the 1905 this year. Another LaurelThirst regular, Little Sue (a.k.a. Susannah Weaver) played at the White Eagle Monday night. Nineteen years later, the singer-songwriter would be inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame. (Other Hall of Famers who played this week include Steen, Balmer, Lloyd Jones, Curtis Salgado, Mel Brown, Janice Scroggins, Norman Sylvester, Pete Krebs, Jerry Joseph, the Freak Mountain Ramblers, and the Dandy Warhols.) A selection of shows from Tuesday, December 5, 2000 Image: Portlandmercury.com The usually indie-rock-oriented Berbati’s hosted a local blues lineup Tuesday with Curtis Salgado, Janice Scroggins, and Lloyd Jones. Salgado has upcoming shows scheduled close to home as well as in Netherlands and Italy, though his website notes dates are subject to change. Longtime performer, teacher, and mentor Scroggins died in 2014. Jones would be playing this week at the Muddy Rudder and the Spirit Pub if not for COVID-19 closures. Jackstraw has been a Tuesday constant at the LaurelThirst, up through 2020. “They’ve been doing a regular happy hour for over 20 years,” says pub co-owner Lewi Longmire, adding that Jackstraw guitarist Jon Neufeld has helped with construction projects while the pub has been closed this spring. The Medicine Hat on Tuesday hosted Garmonbozia, an early version of Blitzen Trapper with a Twin Peaks–inspired name. At the Pine Street Theatre (which had spent the ’90s as the storied La Luna and would later be briefly known as Solid State), 71-year-old guitar legend Link Wray took the stage on one of his last tours. He died five years later. Common played the Roseland Tuesday night, a few years before some UPN sitcom cameos would lead to the hip-hop artist into acting more regularly. A selection of shows from Wednesday, December 6, 2000 Image: Portlandmercury.com Across the Columbia River in Washington, Vancouver’s Arnada Café space is now home to I Like Comics (currently open for curbside pickup). Slabtown denizens the Dandy Warhols crossed the Willamette River to play at the Pine Street Wednesday. Front man Courtney Taylor-Taylor would purchase the Portland Mercury five years later. (Kidding! That didn't actually happen. But it was a good joke and a memorable issue!) Rabbit Hole performers Pete Krebs & Kung Pao Chickens were both still performing regularly this year, though not generally together. In the intervening decades, Krebs (also of local punk legends Hazel) beat cancer yet again. NE Alberta’s Star E. Rose Café closed in 2012, its space in the old Rexall Drugs building now occupied by the “welcoming unicorn café” Just Bob. Overseeing Beat Resurrection at the Viscount (still around and offering both recorded and livestreamed dance classes during the shutdown) was Cat Daddy, who would later cofound downtown Portland institution Voodoo Doughnut with Karaoke From Hell’s Tres Shannon. Will all the “still going” artists and venues and regular gigs return when the coronavirus shutdown is over? We hope so, but we don’t know. In the meantime, maybe we can catch a livestreamed show and add to a virtual tip jar, buy a local artist’s record from a local record store (Music Millennium has curbside pickup), or, if we’re able, even set aside some of that stimulus check or federal unemployment supplement for future concert tickets (to quote my friend Jerry, you never regret buying concert tickets, so just buy the damn concert tickets) or cover charges or band tip jars. The live music will come back. It has to. Did you play at or attend any of these shows and have something to add? Or just have a question or story idea? Email [email protected]",0.0

Tony Reeves, who was the lead investigator in the wrongful arrest of a black man in Portland, will never be called to testify in any criminal court case again in Clackamas County and should have his police certification revoked, Clackamas County’s district attorney ruled Friday. The decision came after the District Attorney’s Office investigated the unfounded West Linn police arrest of Michael Fesser in 2017. It is the first inquiry completed of more than a half-dozen local, state and federal investigations launched after The Oregonian/OregonLive reported in February that the city of West Linn paid $600,000 to Fesser to settle his civil rights suit against its police force. The DA’s investigation found that Reeves colluded with then-Chief Terry Timeus to pursue an unsupported arrest of Fesser for a personal friend of the police chief’s. The friend was Fesser’s employer at the time. The investigation also found that Reeves withheld key evidence, engaged in an illegal recording of Fesser, deleted racist and vulgar text messages he received from Fesser’s boss on his cellphone and disclosed Fesser’s confidential attorney-client information to Fesser’s boss. West Linn police targeted Fesser, using "" inappropriate and offensive investigative tactics, and lacked transparency, honesty and any sense of fair play,’’ said the district attorney’s 42-page report obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive. The report, signed by Chief Deputy District Attorney Chris Owen and two senior deputy district attorneys, described a “troubling pattern of deceit by omission’’ in an attempt to “mislead’’ and arrest Fesser for alleged theft as a favor to the chief’s friend -- Eric Benson, the owner of A&B Towing Co. in Portland. The inquiry “lacked any pretense of being thorough and objective,’’ the report said. Fesser’s civil litigation against West Linn police and his boss uncovered that Benson was a fishing buddy of Timeus and a West Linn resident. Fesser said the arrest was in retaliation for his complaints about a racially hostile work environment at the towing company. Theft charges against Fesser ultimately were dropped, and Benson and his company paid $415,000 to Fesser to settle a separate discrimination and retaliation suit. Reeves failed to document in his reports the personal relationship between Benson and Timeus and the racist text messages Benson exchanged with him. Reeves also didn’t disclose his seizure of a confidential letter between Fesser and his employment discrimination lawyer from Fesser’s car that discussed Fesser’s racial discrimination claims against Benson. Benson admitted in a civil deposition that Reeves handed him the letter after Fesser’s arrest, yet Reeves told an investigator he didn’t remember if that occurred. Timeus also was aware that Reeves, then a detective, had shared the confidential legal document with Benson, the report said. “This is intolerable,’’ the Clackamas County report said. Reeves has been on paid administrative leave since Feb. 12. Timeus had Reeves initiate the 2017 investigation into Fesser. Timeus retired Nov. 1, 2017, but his police certification was never revoked, despite questionable conduct throughout his career. The district attorney is now recommending that Timeus also lose his certification. Timeus’ “failure of leadership created a culture that allowed this to happen,’’ the report said. The findings trigger a so-called Brady notice, an obligation under the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brady v. Maryland that requires prosecutors to disclose to defense lawyers any material that could impeach the credibility of a government witness. Clackamas County prosecutors are reviewing 40 active criminal cases in which Reeves played a role and will dismiss any that can’t be proven without his testimony, according to the report. The office is also reviewing 500 closed criminal cases in which Reeves played a role to determine if any of those need to be dismissed. “There’s no place for this kind of behavior in law enforcement,’’ District Attorney John Foote said. ""Frankly, there’s no place in civilized society for the racial misconduct in this case.'' In a letter to West Linn’s acting police chief, Foote said “for years now we have heard of unrest and dysfunction in the West Linn Police Department under the leadership Chief Timeus. However, the level of misconduct that has been uncovered in this matter is deeply disturbing and totally unacceptable.’’ Reeves lied in July 2018 to a West Linn police investigator when he said there were no racial or homophobic text messages or emails exchanged between him and Fesser’s boss, the report said. He had previously deleted the text messages from his police cellphone, but Fesser and his lawyer obtained a copy of them from Benson’s phone during civil litigation. The texts were replete with racist, derogatory and crude messages, according to the cell phone evidence. Reeves told an internal affairs investigator that he got rid of the text messages because the case was closed, but they had been deleted before prosecutors in Portland presented the case to a Multnomah County grand jury, the Clackamas County report found. Reeves also never informed Multnomah County prosecutors of the text messages. The racist text messages from Benson revealed his “strong motive to fabricate these allegations to avoid civil liability in a racial discrimination suit.’’ Reeves’ responses by text message also were “unprofessional’’ and displayed a “far too familiar banter,’’ the report said. What Reeves omitted from his sloppy and inadequate reports on the case was “stark and concerning,’’ and done in “bad faith,’’ with no explanation as to why West Linn got involved in an alleged Portland theft case outside of West Linn city limits or any mention of Benson’s friendship with the chief, according to the report. “Quite simply, the WLPD decided to initiate a criminal investigation when there was no actual evidence that a crime was taking place,’’ the report said. Depositions and records from Fesser’s suits against West Linn and Benson revealed West Linn police, with civilian help, made a surreptitious audio recording of Fesser at work in Portland without a warrant or court order, then arrested him without probable cause with the help of Portland police officers. They also seized Fesser’s cash and cellphone in addition to the personal legal document without a search warrant, according to the records. “Their conduct was not merely negligent, inadvertent or result of a momentary lapse of judgment, '' the district attorney’s report said. ""It reflects negatively on their honesty, judgment and sense of fair play that every suspect and victim deserves.’’ Michael Fesser, pictured here with his lawyer, Paul Buchanan, at the start of a community meeting held Wednesday night at De La Salle High School in North Portland to discuss issues of injustice around policing. ""This is a very important step toward accountability,'' Buchanan said of the Clackamas County DA's report. March 11, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff Publicity about Fesser’s claims against West Linn police and his settlement prompted at least four separate investigations. The U.S. Department of Justice is continuing to conduct a civil rights investigation into the police actions. The Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards & Training has tapped an outside lawyer to look into the role played by Michael Stradley, a former West Linn police lieutenant who enlisted the help of Portland’s police gang enforcement officers in the arrest of Fesser and most recently was working as a training supervisor for the state’s basic police academy. Stradley remains on paid leave from the police academy. West Linn’s City Council contracted with the California-based OIR Group to investigate how city officials handled Fesser’s lawsuit against police. The city is paying the firm up to $50,000. Current Chief Terry Kruger, who had vigorously defended the police investigation and arrest of Fesser in two closed executive sessions of the City Council, was placed on paid administrative leave in April while OIR Group inquiry occurs. Kruger also had a personal relationship with Fesser’s boss, West Linn emails obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive revealed. The city is paying $28,500 a month in salary and benefits to Reeves and Kruger while they’re on leave. Reeves’ lawyer David Lesh did not return messages seeking comment Friday about the district attorney’s report. West Linn Acting Police Chief Peter Mahuna said in a statement late Friday, ""I firmly believe the West Linn Police Department will become a better and more professional police department as a result of this investigation and the others still underway. We have a long way to go in earning back the confidence and public trust we’ve lost.'' Fesser’s lawyer Paul Buchanan said he was encouraged by the district attorney’s thorough review and conclusions. ""This is a very important step toward accountability,'' Buchanan said. ""As we’re seeing in Minneapolis, if accountability for police abuse and racism is not vigilant and ongoing, more and greater abuses will occur. We still need accountability for West Linn Police Department’s current leadership and their decision to vigorously defend this egregious abuse of their police power for a year and a half, and for former Lieutenant Stradley.'' Stradley had Portland police gang enforcement officers assist with Fesser’s arrest, contending Fesser had gang ties, though Stradley, a retired Portland police lieutenant, hadn’t had contact with Fesser for more than two decades. "" I’m hopeful that the investigations into those actions, which are ongoing, will be as searching as the one conducted by the Clackamas D.A., and that the willingness to hold those individuals accountable will be present in those investigations as it was here,'' Buchanan said. -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Subscribe to Facebook page Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.

Wochit Read the latest story here: Sounds of explosions and smoke hung in the air around the Oregon State Capitol Building after police declared a protest unlawful and ordered protesters to disperse or be arrested. A march involving more than 200 demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd turned violent late Saturday. The march, which began at about 7 p.m. Saturday and remained peaceful for much of the evening, took a turn after 11 p.m. when projectiles were thrown by individuals in the crowd toward officers near the intersection of Church Street NE and Court Street NE. Salem police spokesman Lt. Treven Upkes said police broke up the crowd and used tear gas after several explosive devices and hard objects were thrown. Just after midnight, he warned that another round of tear gas would be used to break up the crowd. Upkes said no injuries were reported. No arrests had been made as of midnight. ""All we want is for people to disperse,"" Upkes said. State of emergency declared, curfew instituted until Monday Police began making announcements of a curfew in Salem, which was issued by the city manager. The curfew stands until 6 a.m. Sunday and again from 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. The curfew, which applies to the entire city according to the release, prohibits travel on any public street, sidewalk or public place except for individuals going directly to or from their workplace, seeking medical care, avoiding dangerous situations or those that are unhoused. On Sunday morning, cleanup began on the vandalism from the night before. Giant tarps covered the spray-painted reliefs in front of the Capitol building. A window was broken at Ross Dress for Less, and several glass doors were boarded up at Salem Center mall. Salem Mayor Chuck Bennett said he supported the actions of Salem police during the protest. ""The response from the city was appropriate and proportional to the potential problems from a group vandalizing the State Capitol, throwing projectiles at police and declining to follow a dispersal direction being issued at 11:30 at night,"" Bennett said Sunday. The mayor said there was no reason to take a chance on a few ""misguided individuals"" destroying public and private property. ""We are all shocked and outraged by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,"" Bennett said. ""This horrible event is more than worthy of public discussion and protest,"" he said.""It is not an event that can be allowed to be used as an excuse for criminal activity as we’ve seen in many other cities including here in Oregon."" Shortly after another round of tear gas was used, the crowd around the Capitol building broke up. By 12:30 a.m., it was a ghost town, leaving only empty bottles, the sting and sulfur smell of tear gas and graffiti on the Capitol steps. The drone of sirens continued downtown. The Saturday protest was the second in Salem demanding justice for the death of Floyd. The Friday evening protest remained peaceful for the duration as demonstrators held vigil on the Capitol steps. Early Saturday evening, a small group of people gathered outside Glamour Salon, the site of controversy and protests earlier this month after the owner reopened in violation of Gov. Kate Brown's order. Those outside the salon said they were bracing to protect businesses should violence erupt. People attending the protest said the event was largely peaceful until someone began tagging the Capitol building with spray paint and a fight broke out. Many say those protesting tried to stop the people from damaging property and disavowed them. Earlier in the night, several participants reported having guns pointed at them by people observing the protest. Those filming the event reported broken bottles, flashbang grenades and fireworks being thrown at police.

Around midnight, as police were ordering people to leave, a group frantically ooked for their younger friend, a young woman thanked police for working to keep the crowd safe and a protester gave out antacid liquid medication to help those with their eyes stinging from tear gas. After the crowd was dispersed at the Capital Mall, tensions heightened outside Glamour Salon. Fistfights broke out, and police again tear-gassed the crowd. The @cityofsalem has declared a state of emergency & issued an emergency order imposing a curfew throughout the city of #SalemOR in all public places during the following times: 8:00P Sat., 5/30/2020 to 6:00A Sun., 5/31/2020 and 8:00P Sun., 5/31/2020 to 6:00A Mon., 6/1/2020 pic.twitter.com/Ramj86lD02 — Salem Police Dept. (@SalemPoliceDept) May 31, 2020 Earlier in the night, Upkes said extra patrols would be downtown to monitor the protest. ""Our main goal is to protect their right to peacefully gather,"" he said. The night proved to be full of miscommunication and disinformation early on. A Reddit thread suggesting a gathering at the transit mall, which some feared would bring rioting, was later deleted. Reports of roadblocks and closed streets early in the night proved to be false. Salem's state of emergency came a day after those in the crowd of a 300-person protest in Eugene set property on fire, smashed the windows of local businesses, battered vehicles with their drivers still inside and set off fireworks, according to The Register-Guard. Mayors in both Portland and Seattle again issued curfew orders for Sunday evening. Police in Seattle arrested at least 27 people Saturday on charges like assault and looting while Portland police arrested 48 people after downtown storefronts were vandalized and fires were set. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee dispatched the National Guard to Washington's largest city to help maintain order. The Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association and Oregon State Police issued a statement Saturday that said the organizations were ""unified in condemning the reprehensible actions and tactics demonstrated in Minneapolis that resulted in the tragic death of George Floyd."" The statement said public trust and accountability are paramount for police agencies and officers in a safe, inclusive community. ""We recognize that even isolated incidents of police misconduct anywhere undermine public trust everywhere.,"" the statement said. ""We are dismayed and disgusted when the actions of a few tarnish the reputation of our honorable law enforcement profession and undermine the heroic work our police officers perform in service to our communities."" In a joint statement, officials with the Oregon Justice Resource Center and Council on American-Islamic Relations in Oregon spoke out against the curfews in Portland and other Oregon cities, saying the curfews were an attack on the rights of all Oregonians. ""This is a critical moment to confront police violence and brutality, protect black life, and support necessary healing for our communities of color through systematic reforms and resources,"" ORJR and CAIR-Oregon officials said. ""Instead, elected and public officials are responding to this moment using the same mechanisms that brought us here: aggressive policing."" They said the curfews and the response encourages law enforcement to continue targeting communities of color. ""This should be a time that we are thinking of what we can do to increase protections, instead of devaluing those rights that we hold so valuable,"" they said. - The Associated Press contributing For questions, comments and news tips, email reporter Whitney Woodworth at wmwoodworth@statesmanjournal.com, call 503-910-6616 or follow on Twitter @wmwoodworth Read or Share this story: https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2020/05/31/police-use-tear-gas-disperse-protesters-downtown-salem-curfew-instituted/5298432002/",0.0

(KOIN) — Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler extended a curfew for the City of Portland Sunday upon discussing the city’s response to the second night of violent demonstrations. The restriction will again begin at 8 p.m. and last through 6 a.m. Monday. Wheeler was joined by fellow city leaders to comment on the aftermath of the rioting and plans for moving forward. Wheeler opened his brief address Sunday morning by saying cities across the country “are waking up to a dark morning in America. The cause that rallied the country to decry systematic violence and racism against our black friends and neighbors … has been co-opted by rioters and looters to use the moral soul of this movement as cover to destroy our communities.” Portland police dispersed hundreds of protesters in the 2nd night of civil disturbance, May 30, 2020 (KOIN) At least 48 people were arrested during Portland’s protest, police said, ranging in age from 19-49. A total of 26 people were charged with curfew violations, but all of them faced other, more serious charges, including riot, burglary and disorderly conduct. Another nine minors were detained and released to their parents on charges including curfew violation, riot, disorderly conduct, riot, burglary, theft. Wheeler and other leaders commended the dispatchers and departments from around the metro area that provided support, as well as the contractors, volunteers and businesses who helped clean up the city Saturday morning and board up windows in preparation for more protests. “We used every resource at our disposal and it was not enough” Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of downtown Portland Saturday night, mirroring the dozens of other protests in other major US cities. Protesters from coast to coast took to the streets over the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch acknowledged the peaceful protests that happened Friday afternoon and said most of those demonstrators went home. However, the city later saw vandalism, a shooting, fires being set in occupied buildings, and an officer being injured by an incendiary device, Resch said. “We used every resource at our disposal and it was not enough to stop the widespread criminal acts for several hours,” Resch said. With an emergency order and curfew in hand, Resch said they were more prepared Saturday. They were able to bring in support from other law enforcement agencies including Gresham police, Port of Portland police, Multnomah County deputies, Washington County deputies, Washougal police, and the Oregon State Police. Saturday’s crowds were also smaller, Resch said, though police still made significant arrests. Resch said those arrested were a mix of Portland residents and out-of-towners, but did not elaborate. Sunday morning, the Council on American-Islamic Relations Oregon branch and the Oregon Justice Resource Center issued a joint statement condemning the implementation of a curfew as “an attack on our rights.” The statement said in part, “This is a critical moment to confront police violence and brutality, protect black life, and support necessary healing for our communities of color through systematic reforms and resources. Instead, elected and public officials are responding to this moment using the same mechanisms that brought us here: aggressive policing. This curfew and response encourages law enforcement to continue targeting communities of color through a multitude of techniques which include an abuse of force.” Wheeler will make a second press conference at 1:30 p.m. Sunday with community leaders at Self Enhancement, Inc. (SEI) to talk about the impact of the demonstrations on local black communities.",0.0

(KOIN) — Protests honoring George Floyd in Salem and Eugene turned violent Saturday, marking the second consecutive night of demonstrations in both cities. In Salem, what started as a peaceful protest in the early evening hours took a violent turn around 11 p.m. after people in crowds began throwing things at police officers near the intersection of Church Street NE and Court Street NE, according to the Statesman Journal. Officers broke up the crowd and used tear gas after several explosive devices and hard objects were thrown. As of midnight, no arrests had been made and no injuries had been reported. Downtown Eugene vandalized, looted by rioters Wheeler extends curfew, addresses 2nd night of protests Like Portland, Salem initially instituted a citywide curfew as an attempt to curb as much unrest as possible. But Salem City Manager Steve Powers canceled plans for a Sunday night curfew after consulting with Salem Police Chief Jerry Moore. Moore saw no need for a Sunday night curfew. However, the Salem Declaration of Emergency remains in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. In Eugene, where a curfew was also put in place, the night began with smaller groups walking through the downtown area carrying signs and wearing masks. Around 10 p.m., however, some groups began to block traffic and engage in various types of criminal behavior, according to Eugene Police. A group of about 20 people gathered in front of a fire station near West 13th Avenue and Willamette Street and lit a torch that allegedly caught the station’s flag on fire. The group moved around and grew to about 35 people before multiple arrests were made around 12:30 a.m. Sunday. This is a developing story and will be updated throughout the day.",0.0

Protests were held in U.S. cities over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) WASHINGTON (AP) — Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with peaceful demonstrations against police killings of black people overshadowed by unrest that ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters’ movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it “really shocking to watch.” In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) LONDON (AP) — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, speaking to the media Sunday, May 31, strongly denounced protesters who have committed acts of violence and caused millions of dollars in property damage during the two previous nights. Speaking just hours after at least 48 people were arrested in the second round of violence, Wheeler said he was speaking directly to what he described as a small group of agitators and opportunists using the cover of legitimate grievances to spread fear. ""The cause has been coopted by rioters and looters to use the moral soul of this movement to destroy our communities,"" Wheeler said about what he deemed the legitimate outrage over the death of African-American George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. ""This no longer feel like sincere mourning. It feels like blatant lawlessness and senseless violence."" Wheeler also extended the previous emergency curfew he had declared after the riot that broke out Friday evening and extended into Saturday morning. The new curfew will last from 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. Violators are once again subject to arrest and a $500 fine. Although hundreds of protesters ignored the first curfew, the crowds the second night were far smaller and caused less property damage and looting. Portland Fire & Rescue Division Chief Ryan Gillespie said firefighters responded to five structure fires, two vehicle fires, two dumpster fires and multiple injures overnight, far less than the responses on Friday night and Saturday morning. Portland Police Chief Jamie Resch said law enforcement officers were better prepared to respond on the second night. She said no one predicted that ""several hundred"" of those participating in early peaceful Friday demonstrators would riot downtown, despite the fact that destructive riots already had broken out in other American cities by then. in contrast, all officers were called to duty Saturday and other agencies provided staff, including the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office and the Oregon State Police. Bureau of Emergency Management Director Mike Myers described the scramble to respond to Friday's escalating first night of protests. Mayor Ted Wheeler was out of town meeting with his family to plan for the death of his mother. Fire Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty called Myers around midnight when she saw TV coverage of the spreading riot and then met him at the command center. Myers called the city attorney who began writing the emergency declaration for the curfew. Wheeler wanted it in his hand the moment he returned to Portland, Myers said. Myers said that, until then, his bureau had been coordinating emergency assistance to this impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including proving food, rent assistance and personal protective equipment. It had been looking forward to helping the economy recover on June 12 after Multnomah County applies to the state for permission on June 5. By early Saturday, Myers said he was busy coordinating the boarding up of damaged businesses and the cleanup of city streets with contractors and other city bureaus. Late in the press conference, Wheeler said damage estimates are still being prepared, but they include dozens of businesses and millions of dollars in losses. ""It is substantial,"" Wheeler said.",0.0

A march involving more than 200 demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd turned violent late Saturday. The march, which began at about 7 p.m. Saturday and remained peaceful for much of the evening, took a turn after 11 p.m. when projectiles were thrown by individuals in the crowd toward officers near the intersection of Church Street NE and Court Street NE. Salem police spokesman Lt. Treven Upkes said police broke up the crowd and used tear gas after several explosive devices and hard objects were thrown. Just after midnight, he warned that another round of tear gas would be used to break up the crowd. Upkes said no injuries were reported. No arrests had been made as of midnight. ""All we want is for people to disperse,"" Upkes said. Salem instituted a curfew for Saturday night, which was issued by the city manager. A Salem curfew continues 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. Shortly after another round of tear gas was used, the crowd around the Capitol building broke up. By 12:30 a.m., it was a ghost town, leaving only empty bottles, the sting and sulfur smell of tear gas and graffiti on the Capitol steps. The drone of sirens continued downtown. The Saturday protest was the second in Salem demanding justice for the death of Floyd. The Friday evening protest remained peaceful for the duration as demonstrators held vigil on the Capitol steps. Seattle protests turn violent Dozens of people were arrested in Seattle and Portland, as protests over the killing of George Floyd turned violent, with looters smashing up storefronts and mayors in both cities again issuing curfew orders for Sunday evening. Police in Seattle arrested at least 27 people Saturday on charges like assault and looting while Portland police arrested 48 people after downtown storefronts were vandalized and fires were set. Seattle had a 5 p.m. curfew Saturday and Portland's was 8 p.m. Those curfews for the entire cities will remain in place for Sunday, officials said. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee dispatched the National Guard to Washington's largest city to help maintain order. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced her curfew for Saturday and Sunday after rioters torched police vehicles and spilled onto Interstate 5, forcing the freeway's temporary closure through the central part of the Northwest's largest city. Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle in the rain to protest the killing of Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. A largely peaceful demonstration happened in Seattle on Saturday afternoon, while police later deployed flash bangs to disperse people they said had begun throw rocks and bottles at officers. Police also pepper-sprayed demonstrators who got close to police lines, and officers with bicycles pushed people to move back. The Washington State Patrol temporarily closed both directions of Interstate 5 through the city between Interstate 90 and Highway 520. Protesters marched through the lanes of the freeway. News footage showed at least one destroyed police cruiser, other vehicle fires and people breaking into retail stores and other businesses. Seattle Police said two rifles that were stolen from patrol cars that were set on fire have been recovered by a private security guard for a local television reporter. Although many dispersed soon after, dozens remained downtown in defiance of the curfew, setting fires, breaking into retail stores and taking items while police fired tear gas and arrested at least one person. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said officers and others were injured, though she didn't provide details. ""We will continue to respond swiftly to all acts of violence and destruction,"" Best said in a statement. The governor said he had activated up to 200 members of the Washington National Guard in response to a request from the city to help protect property, as well as manage crowds and traffic. Guard personnel will be unarmed and work under the direction of city leadership, the statement from the governor's office said. ""The National Guard is on stand by to assist the Seattle Police Department as requested by Mayor Durkan,"" Inslee said. ""They will only be utilized if absolutely necessary and we appreciate their efforts to help in this important work."" As for the curfew, residents should remain in their homes ""to the extent possible"" and not travel in or through Seattle when it is in place, said Durkan, Best and Seattle Fire Department Chief Harold Scoggins in a statement. Portland curfew extended to Sunday night Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced Sunday morning that his city's curfew would continue, and starts again at 8 p.m. Sunday. For a second night, people in Portland roamed city streets. Officers said some threw projectiles at them. According to a statement, fireworks and ""aerial mortars"" were thrown at the Multnomah County Courthouse late Saturday. In a tweet Sunday morning, Wheeler, Portland's mayor, wrote: ""Agitators are not led by a conviction to change systemic racism. They are opportunists, using the cover of legitimate protests to sow fear in our communities. Don't let them."" Salem business owners braced for violence Early Saturday evening, a small group of people gathered in downtown Salem outside Glamour Salon, the site of controversy and protests earlier this month after the owner reopened in violation of Gov. Kate Brown's order. Those outside the salon said they were bracing to protect businesses should violence erupt. People attending the protest at the Capitol said the event was largely peaceful until someone began tagging the Capitol building with spray paint and a fight broke out. Earlier in the night, several participants reported having guns pointed at them by people observing the protest. Those filming the event reported broken bottles, flashbang grenades and fireworks being thrown at police. Around midnight, as police were ordering people to leave, a group looked for their younger friend frantically, a young woman thanked police for working to keep the crowd safe and a protester gave out antacid liquid medication to help those with their eyes stinging from tear gas. After the crowd was dispersed at the Capital Mall, tensions heightened outside Glamour Salon. Fist fights broke out, and police again tear gassed the crowd. Salem's state of emergency comes one day after those in the crowd of a 300-person protest in Eugene set a property on fire, smashed the windows of local businesses, battered vehicles with their drivers still inside and set off fireworks, according to the Register-Guard. Willamette Week reported that on Friday, rioters set fire to the Multnomah County Justice Center, set fires in the streets, and looted downtown shops in Portland. The violence resulted in Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler ordering an 8 p.m. curfew Saturday and Sunday. The Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association and Oregon State Police issued a statement Saturday that said the organizations were ""unified in condemning the reprehensible actions and tactics demonstrated in Minneapolis that resulted in the tragic death of George Floyd."" The statement said public trust and accountability are paramount for police agencies and officers in a safe, inclusive community. ""We recognize that even isolated incidents of police misconduct anywhere undermine public trust everywhere.,"" the statement said. ""We are dismayed and disgusted when the actions of a few tarnish the reputation of our honorable law enforcement profession and undermine the heroic work our police officers perform in service to our communities.""

1621701227,2020-05-31 11:55:00,Portland Curfew To Resume Sunday Night Following Continued Protests,https://www.opb.org/news/article/george-floyd-protests-portland-oregon-arrests-vandalism-curfews/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (5:05 p.m. PT) — Protests prompted by the death of George Floyd resumed Sunday in Portland, even as Mayor Ted Wheeler extended the city’s curfew for another night and transportation agencies began limiting access to the central city. The emergency curfew, which will be in effect from 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday, bans travel and allows officers to cite those who disobey. Elsewhere in Oregon, other communities have also implemented curfews following late-night protests and damage. Eugene’s is effective at 9 p.m. Sunday for the downtown area; Salem’s begins at 8 p.m. Sunday and continues until 6 a.m. Monday. But the third day of protests began well before those curfews in many communities, including Portland. A crowd gathered in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center in the afternoon, and Portland Police declared the protest an illegal gathering at 4:30 p.m. after reports that some in the crowd were throwing things at officers. Another protest was planned for 6 p.m. at Laurelhurst Park. City leaders hoped to avoid more violence, in part by limiting access to previous hot spots. TriMet shut service to downtown stops at 3:30 p.m., and highway exits into downtown were closed late Sunday afternoon until midnight. In remarks made Sunday morning, Wheeler said Saturday night’s events showed the events were no longer about Floyd. The black Minnesota man died May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparking outrage and protests across the country. But the movement, Wheeler said, had been co-opted. “It no longer feels like sincere mourning for the death of George Floyd and many other black men and women in this country,” he said. “This behavior we’ve seen for the second night is blatant lawlessness and selfish violence.” He pinned the chaos on a small group of agitators, using, he said, the “moral soul of this movement” as cover. Following the first night of protests, the police bureau’s deputy chief Chris Davis remarked that Friday night’s riots had been “fairly organized-appearing,” leading investigators to wonder whether the rioting was coordinated. But, on Sunday morning, Chief Jami Resch, who had returned from mandated furlough, said the second night’s protests had been “different in nature,” with smaller crowds splintering off. Police reported “significant” property damage following Saturday night’s protests. Portland Fire & Rescue reported fires set to five structures, two vehicles, and a dozen categorized as “dumpster or miscellaneous.” Early Sunday morning, the police bureau said they’d made 48 arrests. Thirty of those arrested were aged 21 or younger. Resch said there’s been a mix of local Portlanders and protesters from elsewhere. Resch said departments from across the region had sent officers to assist Saturday night: police departments for the Port of Portland, Gresham, and Washougal, the sheriffs’ offices from Washington and Multnomah County, and the Oregon State Police. Portland’s Saturday curfew had been put in place in an effort to quell or avoid a repeat of Friday evening, when downtown businesses were looted and the Multnomah County Justice Center burned. In the hours before Saturday’s curfew kicked in, a large crowd grew outside the Justice Center to protest the death of Floyd. Early Saturday evening, the gathering was focused clearly on memorializing Floyd. Large crowds moved through downtown Portland, chanting in support of Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, garnering appreciative car honks. Protesters lay face down in front of the Justice Center, chanting “I Can’t Breathe,” the words Floyd uttered shortly before his death. But police didn’t wait for the curfew to start dispersing the crowd. A little after 7 p.m., officers began blanketing the area with tear gas, ordering protesters to leave. The crowd charged north into Old Town and eventually east across the Steel Bridge. Some lingered downtown, where officers continued to use tear gas in an effort to clear the area. Others marched over to the Lloyd District, taking the protests to the city’s East side. As the evening wore on and the protest splintered, the gathering developed a cat-and-mouse element, with police cars chasing back and forth across bridges trying to disperse protesters who would break apart and regroup. The looting and vandalism that rocked the end of Friday’s protests continued. Police reported fireworks thrown at the Multnomah County Courthouse. Some protesters smashed windows and set fires. In his remarks Sunday, Mike Myers, the director of the Portland’s Bureau of Emergency Management, said it had been clear to him since the night of the first protests that a curfew order would be necessary to prevent further destruction. He recounted waking up the city attorney at 1 a.m. to ensure the mayor had “that curfew order in his hand when he lands on the ground.” Wheeler had been out of town with his family, attending to his mother’s hospice care. But the curfew order has since drawn criticism from Oregon civil rights groups. In a statement, Oregon’s American Civil Liberties Union called it “an extraordinary measure that will likely lead to selective enforcement.” Officers, the statement noted, already had the power to intervene if protesters were breaking the law. The Oregon chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Oregon Justice Resource Center also condemned the curfew, accusing elected officials of using the same mechanisms that brought protesters out onto the streets in the first place — aggressive policing. “The implementation of a curfew in Portland as a response to protests is an attack on our rights,” the groups said. “This is a critical moment to confront police violence and brutality, protect black life, and support necessary healing for our communities of color through systematic reforms and resources.” According to the bureau, at least 26 people have been arrested with charges related to the curfew. (The bureau didn’t list the charges against the nine juveniles arrested). Of the 26 known curfew-related arrests, 21 people had other charges listed. In a statement, Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, who had asked for the curfew when the mayor was out of town, said she understood the concerns that a curfew would lead to over-policing. The intent, she wrote, was to give a chance for protesters to refocus. “Given the incredibly high tension during this time, I want to give Portland a moment to cool off and reground ourselves,” she wrote. “This is a moment to recalibrate and figure out how each and every Portlander will act to support the black community because we cannot accept the conditions and systems that continue to harm us.” Hardesty had expressed frustration after the first night of protests that reporters appeared most interested in police response and not the pain that had caused the unrest in the first place. In Sunday’s statement, she emphasized once again the community’s focus should remain on this pain and the systemic racism that caused it “rather than obsess over the narrative of destruction when people protest.” This story will be updated.",0.0

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) U.S. retailers large and small have closed some of their stores across the country because of disruptions caused by the widespread street protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Target, CVS, Apple and Walmart all said Sunday that they had temporarily closed or limited hours at some locations for safety reasons. In some places, their stores have been burned, broken into or looted as protests turned violent. Amazon said Sunday that it has adjusted its routes and suspended deliveries to keep its drivers safe in some cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis. A spokeswoman, Kelly Cheeseman, said Amazon is also abiding by local curfews that have required people to remain off streets after a specified hour at night. Small businesses, too, are surveying the damage or trying to determine how to operate amid the chaos. Ammar Aref, who owns a corner grocery store in Minneapolis blocks from where Floyd was killed, said he has stayed opened every day, but he doesn’t know how much stock to order and his employees don’t want to come to work. He boards up his windows every night. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, said it has closed six stores for an extended period. Some of the worst damage was seen at its Lake Street store near where Floyd was killed. Footage showed people walking away with merchandise as smoke filled the store. The company said Sunday it was boarding up the store. Target said it hopes to reopen the Lake Street store by the end of this year. Another of its stores in Minneapolis remains closed, along with stores in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago and Oakland, California. At more than 200 of its stores, Target said it had either adjusted hours or temporarily closed over the weekend, though most of the stores were scheduled to reopen Sunday or Monday. Walmart said it closed hundreds of stores late Sunday afternoon to protect employees and customers. Scott Pope, a spokesman, said several dozen stores were closed all day Sunday because of damage from protests. He said he didn’t know when those stores would be able to reopen. CVS didn’t say how many stores it closed but said it shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “We are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Apple said it decided to keep some of its stores closed Sunday. It didn’t say how many were affected. Floyd, who was black, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd, who was handcuffed, pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The three other officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven’t been charged. Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums that they are earning because of the coronavirus pandemic. They will also be able to work at Target locations that remain open. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” ___ AP Writer Stephen Groves contributed from Minneapolis.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) SEATTLE (AP) — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and thefts in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities following protests over the killing of George Floyd. And police in Portland, Oregon, deployed incendiary devices to disperse a large crowd in downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles – including aerial mortars – were thrown at officers. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 troops for Bellevue. On Saturday night, people smashed downtown Seattle storefronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday, there were thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee’s activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. “We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,” Inslee said in a statement. “But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.” Interstate 5 through downtown Seattle was closed Sunday afternoon because of protest activity, the second day in arrow the main north-south freeway on the West Coast was shut down, and there was also widespread stealing in Bellevue, Washington. Portland also again saw large rallies, and police used tear gas to disperse crowds. Later Sunday night hundreds of people gathered outside the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown. Police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse and through loudspeakers authorities declared the late-night gathering a civil disturbance. Bellevue’s mayor declared an emergency Sunday evening because of the violence and said she was enacting a 5:30 p.m. curfew for the downtown area of the city east of Seattle. Gov. Jay Inslee said late Sunday he was sending 200 National Guard troops to Bellevue. Bellevue Police said dozens of people broke into Bellevue Square, a large shopping mall. Officers entered the facility and chased people out. Mayor Lynne Robinson said people were stealing merchandise from storefronts and that help was requested from other police agencies. Earlier, the Washington State Patrol said it was sending units to help quell the unrest there. Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett said at an evening news conference that authorities learned earlier that a criminal gang planned activity in the city Sunday afternoon. He said there was widespread stealing and assaults, and the criminal element “swelled very quickly.” ““They were there to destroy,” chief said. “We welcome peaceful protest ... this is something different.” Mylett said he was disgusted at what happened to Floyd, who was killed when a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck, but that violence overshadows legitimate protests. Later Sunday night, police in Tukwila, Washington, said there were thefts at several stores around Southcenter Mall. Police fired tear gas and made several arrests. Stealing was also reported in nearby Renton, Washington. Washington State Patrol spokesman Rick Johnson said I-5 was closed for safety reasons, and all Interstate 405 ramps to downtown Bellevue were closed as well because of the mayhem there. I-5 in Seattle was reopened Sunday night. Hundreds of people gathered to rally Sunday in downtown Seattle following unrest Saturday night that saw storefronts smashed and thefts. The first few hours of the Sunday demonstration were peaceful with the group taking a knee every so often in silence and chanting “Say his name, George Floyd.” People along nearby streets cleaned and boarded up windows while law enforcement officers on all corners observed. Dallas Dala, a black man who moved to Seattle from the Congo in 2008, said Sunday that he had been at the protests to support and talk with people. “For me it was about every life matters no matter what, white, black yellow or red. I love everybody,” he said. However several people were later arrested, and police deployed incendiary devices to control the crowd. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan again imposed a 5 p.m. curfew for all of Seattle. At a Sunday evening news conference, Durkan said thousands of people have protested peacefully in the city over the weekend. But those who cause mayhem don’t honor concerns about racism and Floyd’s death and “came to, number one, purposely create violence and destruction,” she said. Inslee dispatched an additional 200 National Guard troops to Seattle to help maintain order after protests turned chaotic, with rioters smashing up storefronts and stealing clothes and other items from downtown shops. Inslee’s order means that up to to 400 National Guard personnel will be available to assist. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said of Sunday’s 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew: “We fully intend to enforce that curfew in the city.” However hundreds of mostly peaceful demonstrators marched between downtown and the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, also imposed a Sunday curfew for 8 p.m. Portland, too, saw widespread mayhem Friday and Saturday. Other Northwest cities with Sunday curfews included Eugene and Salem in Oregon. There were protests and rallies in other Northwest cities on Sunday. In Spokane, hundreds marched through downtown carrying signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and chanting “no justice, no peace.” Later in the evening, police used tear gas to move crowds away from downtown stores after reports of thefts. Police in Seattle arrested at least 27 people Saturday on charges like assault and theft, while Portland police arrested 48 people after downtown storefronts were vandalized and fires were set overnight Saturday. ADVERTISEMENT On Sunday morning, hundreds of people of all ages turned out in downtown Seattle to help clean up the destruction, sweeping up broken glass and cleaning off graffiti. Durkan and Best walked through the area and spoke with business owners. “I visited downtown this morning. It wasn’t a downtown I recognized,” Durkan said Sunday. “But what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” In Seattle, Durkan announced her curfew for Saturday and Sunday after rioters torched police vehicles and spilled onto I-5, forcing the freeway’s temporary closure through the central part of the city. Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle in the rain to protest the killing of Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe . A largely peaceful demonstration happened in Seattle on Saturday afternoon, while police later deployed flash bang grenades to disperse people they said had begun throw rocks and bottles at officers. Police also pepper-sprayed demonstrators who got close to police lines, and officers with bicycles pushed people to move back. News footage showed at least one destroyed police cruiser, other vehicle fires and people breaking into retail stores and other businesses. Video shot by a journalist from the Seattle news website Crosscut showed police arriving as storefronts were being smashed and broken into. As one officer restrained a person being arrested, the video showed the officer putting his knee on the man’s neck and the crowd yells for him to remove it. The video then shows a second officer pulling the knee off the neck and onto the detained man’s back.",0.0

Thousands of people filled Peninsula Park in North Portland for an evening vigil that lasted three hours. Hundreds then began marching on Rosa Parks Avenue, planning to end at the downtown Portland police headquarters four miles away. The events remained largely peaceful and police remained distant from the protests. But tension escalated as marchers made their way toward downtown. Portland Police labeled the event as an “unlawful assembly” around 11 p.m., as hundreds of marchers congregated outside the Multnomah County Justice Center, which houses the police headquarters. Some demonstrators smashed windows in the building. “If you do not go home now, force will be used to disperse you,” Portland police said on Twitter. The Friday night demonstrations were the largest in Portland in response to the death of George Floyd on Monday. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, as Floyd can be heard on video saying he could not breathe and pleading for help. Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder in connection with Floyd’s death. People of all ages streamed into Peninsula Park Friday to protest the killing. Many carried homemade cardboard signs. One sign said, “He begged for his life. Remember your oath.” Several speakers, mostly people of color, addressed the crowd. They delivered their speeches using a megaphone as they stood in a pavilion where a white banner said, “No justice, no peace.” Jamal Williams, a black Portland resident who said he’d been coming to Peninsula Park all his life, urged white residents to be better allies. He noted hundreds of protesters who gathered at the Oregon Capitol earlier in May to protest Gov. Kate Brown’s stay-home orders and wondered aloud, “Where are they for us?” “If all lives mattered, we wouldn’t be in this park right now,” Williams said. The gathering is likely among the largest in Oregon since Brown banned large crowds in March to quell the spread of the coronavirus. Large gatherings are still barred. A spokesperson for Brown did not return a message or email Friday regarding the demonstration. Most people who attended Friday night’s event wore face masks. The march began around 9 p.m. Organizers announced that the march would conclude at the Multnomah County Justice Center. The crowd marched south on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

At least two protests occurred Thursday. The first drew a small crowd, and the second loosely attracted dozens of people, who marched through downtown Portland, blocking many roads. Many held signs in solidarity with Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement.

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

Wochit Read the latest story here: Sounds of explosions and smoke hung in the air around the Oregon State Capitol Building after police declared a protest unlawful and ordered protesters to disperse or be arrested. A march involving more than 200 demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd turned violent late Saturday. The march, which began at about 7 p.m. Saturday and remained peaceful for much of the evening, took a turn after 11 p.m. when projectiles were thrown by individuals in the crowd toward officers near the intersection of Church Street NE and Court Street NE. Salem police spokesman Lt. Treven Upkes said police broke up the crowd and used tear gas after several explosive devices and hard objects were thrown. Just after midnight, he warned that another round of tear gas would be used to break up the crowd. Upkes said no injuries were reported. No arrests had been made as of midnight. ""All we want is for people to disperse,"" Upkes said. State of emergency declared, curfew instituted until Monday Police began making announcements of a curfew in Salem, which was issued by the city manager. The curfew stands until 6 a.m. Sunday and again from 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. The curfew, which applies to the entire city according to the release, prohibits travel on any public street, sidewalk or public place except for individuals going directly to or from their workplace, seeking medical care, avoiding dangerous situations or those that are unhoused. On Sunday morning, cleanup began on the vandalism from the night before. Giant tarps covered the spray-painted reliefs in front of the Capitol building. A window was broken at Ross Dress for Less, and several glass doors were boarded up at Salem Center mall. Salem Mayor Chuck Bennett said he supported the actions of Salem police during the protest. ""The response from the city was appropriate and proportional to the potential problems from a group vandalizing the State Capitol, throwing projectiles at police and declining to follow a dispersal direction being issued at 11:30 at night,"" Bennett said Sunday. The mayor said there was no reason to take a chance on a few ""misguided individuals"" destroying public and private property. ""We are all shocked and outraged by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,"" Bennett said. ""This horrible event is more than worthy of public discussion and protest,"" he said.""It is not an event that can be allowed to be used as an excuse for criminal activity as we’ve seen in many other cities including here in Oregon."" Shortly after another round of tear gas was used, the crowd around the Capitol building broke up. By 12:30 a.m., it was a ghost town, leaving only empty bottles, the sting and sulfur smell of tear gas and graffiti on the Capitol steps. The drone of sirens continued downtown. The Saturday protest was the second in Salem demanding justice for the death of Floyd. The Friday evening protest remained peaceful for the duration as demonstrators held vigil on the Capitol steps. Early Saturday evening, a small group of people gathered outside Glamour Salon, the site of controversy and protests earlier this month after the owner reopened in violation of Gov. Kate Brown's order. Those outside the salon said they were bracing to protect businesses should violence erupt. People attending the protest said the event was largely peaceful until someone began tagging the Capitol building with spray paint and a fight broke out. Many say those protesting tried to stop the people from damaging property and disavowed them. Earlier in the night, several participants reported having guns pointed at them by people observing the protest. Those filming the event reported broken bottles, flashbang grenades and fireworks being thrown at police.

Around midnight, as police were ordering people to leave, a group frantically ooked for their younger friend, a young woman thanked police for working to keep the crowd safe and a protester gave out antacid liquid medication to help those with their eyes stinging from tear gas. After the crowd was dispersed at the Capital Mall, tensions heightened outside Glamour Salon. Fistfights broke out, and police again tear-gassed the crowd.

(@SalemPoliceDept) May 31, 2020 Earlier in the night, Upkes said extra patrols would be downtown to monitor the protest. ""Our main goal is to protect their right to peacefully gather,"" he said. The night proved to be full of miscommunication and disinformation early on. A Reddit thread suggesting a gathering at the transit mall, which some feared would bring rioting, was later deleted. Reports of roadblocks and closed streets early in the night proved to be false. Salem's state of emergency came a day after those in the crowd of a 300-person protest in Eugene set property on fire, smashed the windows of local businesses, battered vehicles with their drivers still inside and set off fireworks, according to The Register-Guard. Mayors in both Portland and Seattle again issued curfew orders for Sunday evening. Police in Seattle arrested at least 27 people Saturday on charges like assault and looting while Portland police arrested 48 people after downtown storefronts were vandalized and fires were set. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee dispatched the National Guard to Washington's largest city to help maintain order. The Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association and Oregon State Police issued a statement Saturday that said the organizations were ""unified in condemning the reprehensible actions and tactics demonstrated in Minneapolis that resulted in the tragic death of George Floyd."" The statement said public trust and accountability are paramount for police agencies and officers in a safe, inclusive community. ""We recognize that even isolated incidents of police misconduct anywhere undermine public trust everywhere.,"" the statement said. ""We are dismayed and disgusted when the actions of a few tarnish the reputation of our honorable law enforcement profession and undermine the heroic work our police officers perform in service to our communities."" In a joint statement, officials with the Oregon Justice Resource Center and Council on American-Islamic Relations in Oregon spoke out against the curfews in Portland and other Oregon cities, saying the curfews were an attack on the rights of all Oregonians. ""This is a critical moment to confront police violence and brutality, protect black life, and support necessary healing for our communities of color through systematic reforms and resources,"" ORJR and CAIR-Oregon officials said. ""Instead, elected and public officials are responding to this moment using the same mechanisms that brought us here: aggressive policing."" They said the curfews and the response encourages law enforcement to continue targeting communities of color. ""This should be a time that we are thinking of what we can do to increase protections, instead of devaluing those rights that we hold so valuable,"" they said. - The Associated Press contributing For questions, comments and news tips, email reporter Whitney Woodworth at wmwoodworth@statesmanjournal.com, call 503-910-6616 or follow on Twitter @wmwoodworth Read or Share this story: https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2020/05/31/police-use-tear-gas-disperse-protesters-downtown-salem-curfew-instituted/5298432002/",0.0

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage 'really shocking to watch.' Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers appear to fire a stun gun at the woman and then pull her from the car. They then use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. The mayor said she'd delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. 'I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,' Shields said. 'And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.' Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. 'Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,' Shields said. 'When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally.' Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

Since Camden's police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It's not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. 'We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,"" Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd's death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed and items were stolen, police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media. Marchers in Flint Township, Michigan, arrived at a police station where Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson "" responding to chants of 'Walk with us! Walk with us!"" "" said, 'Come on!' and joined the protest. Police in Fargo, North Dakota, held hands with protesters while officers took a knee in Santa Cruz, California. While Sunday afternoon in New York, officers clapped on protesters, hundreds of whom stopped and took a knee with fists raised just north of the Empire State Building. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the Genesee County sheriff marched with protesters in Flint Township, not Flint.",0.0

(KOIN) — As chants of “I can’t breathe” and “George Floyd” reverberated, thousands of protesters marched through the streets of downtown Portland for a third straight night following the death of the unarmed, handcuffed black man under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Around 9 p.m. a crowd of about 3000 protesters crossed the Burnside Bridge, where they were met with a heavy police presence. They crossed the bridge and headed down SW 3rd, which is the street the Justice Center is on. This vehicle tried to drive through a crowd of protesters in downtown Portland but was turned away, May 31, 2020 (KOIN) For 45 minutes crowds mingled and it was tense but peaceful. A driver tried to drive through the crowd but was turned away by protesters who slashed his tires and smashed his window. Minutes later the mood seemed to change. Protesters threw projectiles, chanted “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” and heard the police say that anyone who throws projectiles is subject to arrest. Shortly after 10 p.m., a KOIN 6 News camera was spray painted by a protester. Around 10:45 p.m., someone in the crowd began shooting fireworks from inside the crowd. Around that same time, protesters broke windows at the Federal Courthouse. Authorities said fires were set inside and police will now use “riot control agents.” The demonstrators were not able to get inside the courthouse.  Police used their loudspeakers to tell the crowd to move to the west. Around 11:30 p.m. tensions rose when fireworks and tear gas canisters were set off. Police and protesters began to clash. Police reported that two arrests were made in that timespan. Minutes later, Portland Police declared the crowd an “unlawful assembly” via Twitter and told people to immediately leave or they “will be subject to uses of force, to include riot control agents and impact munitions.” While demonstrators did not immediately go home, the single large crowd broke into splintered groups.

Things deteriorated rapidly. Protesters threw smoke bombs and glass water bottles at the police, who responded with flash bangs and tear gas. Protesters were seen picking up the flash bangs and throwing them back toward the police. Around 8:10 p.m., police labeled this gathering an “unlawful assembly.” Police began moving protesters back almost immediately. A phalanx of police gathered along SW Main and formed a line as protesters refused to leave. Flashbangs, tear gas and projectiles were used between protesters and police outside the Justice Center in downtown Portland, May 31, 2020 (KOIN) Tear gas canisters were released in the park near the Justice Center, which forced the crowd to move through the streets quickly. Milk was seen on the streets, a liquid used to take the sting out of the eyes from tear gas. Police then used multiple methods — cars, tear gas, possibly rubber bullets — to chase the crowd farther into different parts of downtown, not far from the Schnitzer Concert Hall. The protester continued to move quickly away from the central city. Another group of protesters headed from east Portland, down Burnside and toward the downtown area — near where the other group of protesters ran. This group was relatively peaceful and stayed together as they headed toward downtown, but as the march began some of the people dropped off. There were rumors of counter-protesters mingling with the group, but nothing has been confirmed.

The group of protesters began to march around that same time and police said they wouldn’t interfere if the march remained civil. The march went from the Justice Center to Pioneer Courthouse Square, then back to the Justice Center. The group was large but, as of 6 p.m., remained peaceful. But around 7:30 pm., PPB tweeted there were “a significant amount of protesters near the former SE Precinct. PPB will protect the safety and security of our building.” “PPB is encouraging peaceful assembly tonight. Our liaison officers are working with organizers of the demonstration at the former SE Precinct to encourage them to continue to march. Traffic motors are standing by to help facilitate a safety route.” Earlier in the day TriMet suspended downtown operations and ODOT blocked the on-ramps into the Portland area along Hwy 26, I-84 I-5 and I-405. The ramp closures could be in place until midnight, but the situation is fluid, ODOT officials said.

May 31, 2020 (KOIN) Dozens of protesters went to the Laurelhurst Park area on Burnside and met police wearing tactical gear. Chants of “Take off your riot gear, I don’t see no riot here” were interspersed with chants of “Say his name.” At the same time, police used a loudspeaker to tell the group to move along on Burnside and that the back area was blocked off for their safe march. No one moved. Some took part in a ‘die-in’, laying down in the middle of the road. ‘Not here to fight.

For a second straight night, a city-wide curfew begins at 8 p.m. under orders from Mayor Ted Wheeler. At an 8 a.m. press briefing, Wheeler said cities across the country “are waking up to a dark morning in America. The cause that rallied the country to decry systematic violence and racism against our black friends and neighbors … has been co-opted by rioters and looters to use the moral soul of this movement as cover to destroy our communities.” TriMet MAX trains and buses stopped downtown services in Portland at 3:30 p.m. Sunday. The transit agency said the decision was made based on guidance from Portland Police in the wake of “this weekend’s disruptive demonstrations.” It is unclear if services will resume later Sunday night or begin on Monday morning. Sunday afternoon, Ron Herdon, Director of Albina Head Start, added his voice to Wheeler’s sentiments on the recent violence the community has seen this past weekend. “If somehow you think that tearing up is going to help Black people, you are sadly mistaken. Please don’t think that you are doing us any favors by tearing stuff up,” said Herdon. “We have been the victims of that ever since 1619 when the slave ship arrived.” At least 48 people were arrested during Portland’s protest, police said, ranging in age from 19-49. A total of 26 people were charged with curfew violations, but all of them faced other, more serious charges, including riot, burglary and disorderly conduct.

A few at the front of the crowd knelt as well. Many shook hands with officers. “One by one, they all just took a knee and we all just took a knee with them,” said Lyfe Tavarres, who witnessed the emotional moment. “We’re not saying that that is the answer that we’re looking for, but that is a step, and we appreciated it.” “About the looting—we don’t condone looting at all.

Alex Zielinski Leaders in Portland's Black community gathered this afternoon to call for unity, justice, and true commitment to equity as Portland mourns and protests the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. ""This is a moment, but what we need is a movement,"" said Tony Hopson Sr, founder and CEO of Self Enhancement Inc. (SEI), where the afternoon press event was held. Speakers addressed a socially-distant audience of about 75 other leaders in the local Black community—including state legislators, religious leaders, and activists—and the media. ""We can't legislate how people feel about us,"" Hopson said. ""We can't legislate what people think about us. But we can legislate how we hold people accountable for what they do to us."" While the event was organized by Mayor Ted Wheeler, the gathering centered on calls for action from Black leaders to hold elected officers like Wheeler accountable for discriminatory policing, economic disparities, and even the inequitable distribution of health care and stimulus funding in the wake of COVID-19. Several speakers condemned the criminal actions taken by protesters in Portland this weekend, and made a point to contextualize the response. ""Looting personifies how I feel inside,"" said Kali Ladd, director of education nonprofit KairosPDX. ""As wrong as it may be, it is a symbol of our shattering, our devastation, our internal beating every time we see a life lost like George Floyd."" Rukaiyah Adams, chair of Albina Vision Trust, said that while broken windows and expressions of anger may be the most visible response to Floyd's death, it's not the ""whole truth."" ""We cry out because we have the courage to open our eyes and our hearts to listen to George Floyd's call to his mother as he was suffocated on a public street in broad daylight,"" said Adams. ""His voice is the voice of any of us. It is the voice of all of us. So if they ask me what the hell is going on in the streets of Portland, I will not say a broken window... because that is merely a fact. It is not the truth. The truth is that George Floyd's murder and its response on a global scale is an expression of love, the likes of which we have never seen."" Adams also called on Wheeler and other local officials to stop simply talking about police accountability and reform and take action. ""We expect answers,"" she said. Other speakers asked leaders to respond to the public health crisis of systemic racism with the same urgency as the regional response to COVID-19. ""Racism for us, that's the original pandemic in this country,"" said Ron Herndon, longtime community activist and director of Albina Head Start. ""A mask can't prevent racism. Social distancing can't prevent racism. It cannot be escaped by Purell."" Herndon said the pandemic offers a strong example of how Black lives are ignored in local and state government. ""Everyone knew this virus was wreaking hell on Black folks, but to this very day [Oregon Health Authority] has no plan to address Black Oregonians,"" he said. ""We had to approach the county and the city and say, 'Hey, we are vulnerable population, what are you doing to help?'"" According to Herndon, it took his and others' advocacy to get the state and county to agree to open up a free test site at SEI for Black residents to get tested for COVID-19. That program will start on June 6. Wheeler acknowledged his own inadequacies and promised the group that he'll do everything in his power (""with my last breath if it's required"") to improve as an anti-racist leader. ""As a white person, I understand that I have privileges that other people do not, and I know that I speak on behalf of a power structure that has worked against the interests of people of color for too long,"" Wheeler said. ""I am committed to using my privilege to end the long history of injustices wrought against people of color in our community."" ""What is abundantly clear to me right now at this point is that the terms of forgiveness cannot come from the entity that inflicted the wrongdoing in the first place,"" he continued. Joe McFerrin II, CEO of Portland Opportunities Industrialization Center and Rosemary Anderson High School, said it is on Portlanders to hold Wheeler accountable—whether that meant showing up to Portland City Council or a school board meeting to protest or to advocate. ""We don't show up often enough,"" said McFerrin. ""If the mayor says he wants Black folks at the table, then we need to show up.""

It also marks the second night of curfews instituted by Mayor Ted Wheeler for the entirety of Portland. The first night of protests were marked by fires set in the Multnomah County Justice Center and damage to high-end stores downtown. Last night, Saturday May 30, a game of cat-and-mouse was played between protesters who violated the city-wide curfew and cops, who separated the largest group and chased them to the east side of the river. The rest of the evening police focused on those who Mayor Wheeler called ""agitators""—though they were mostly unsuccessful in causing any substantive damage. Tonight starts with two protest/vigils: The first is a ""Demand Justice March"" to honor Black Portlanders killed by police at North Portland's Frazer Park at 7 pm, and the other a ""rally against police brutality"" led by the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front at Laurelhurst Park starting at 6 pm. Our Blair Stenvick and Bob Ham are covering both rallies and will be reporting in regularly.

In any other year, downtown Portland at this exact moment would be in the midst of a massive, annual celebration of all the things we love about this city. But the COVID-19 oubreak forced the cancellation of the 2020 Portland Rose Festival. And in its place this weekend was a disturbing display of destructive behavior downtown that marred a wholly legitimate message of anger from a majority of otherwise peaceful protestors. Instead of parades down Broadway this year, we are left with broken windows at Pioneer Place. And instead of families boarding rides at Waterfront Park, we have fires smoldering in dumpsters and millions of dollars in damages. Beyond the calendar's timing, there is a thread between the festival's absence and the extraordinary eruption of vandalism. The Rose Festival was postponed due to a global health crisis that has put the nation's business on hold. For nearly three months now, people have — for very good reasons — been living in social isolation. They've watched as the virus preyed on people's health and livelihoods, with a disproportional impact on people of color. Then, in rapid succession came three overt examples of racism in distant places that were brought into everyone's homes via modern video technology: A black man who was bird watching in New York's Central Park and threatened for no reason by a white woman; an African-American man out for a jog in Georgia who was hunted down and killed; and then, most graphically horrific, the video that captured a white police officer in Minneapolis crushing the air pipe of George Floyd and killing him. Already feeling frustrated by the virus's toll, many folks were ready to explode. The result, in Portland and other U.S. cities, was a more intense version of so many other protests we've seen in the past. Let's be clear: People have a right to be furious about Floyd's death. They have an obligation to show their dismay through protest. They have a moral duty to demand police reform. They may even practice the long tradition of breaking the law in acts of civil disobedience. Destroying downtown Portland — or the urban center of any other major city — is far from civil. It does nothing to advance the cause of reform, and likely has the opposite effect. The feelings were rawer this time, but the basic narrative was the same. Thousands of people came to protest in peace and make an urgent point about systemic racism. Then, a few smaller groups went on a rampage. Lacking direct evidence, it is irresponsible at this point to put labels on these groups and assume any political motivations. Were they left wing, right wing, or just young people taking advantage? Photos from our journalists show, in one case, what appear to be school-age males breaking into an Apple Store. School would normally be in session for most students until mid-June, but is closed this year because of the virus. We also observed that the bulk of protesters were in their 20s and 30s, but at least eight of the people arrested were minors. City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty summed up the feelings of many Portlanders quite well: ""I believe there was a small group of people who came out last night with a very strong intention of tearing stuff up. I want those people prosecuted."" Ron Herndon, director of Albina Head Start, spoke on Sunday and talked about the horrific timing of the pandemic and acts of violence against people of color: ""COVID has an older brother, an older pathogen … called racism. You can't put a mask on to protect us from racism,"" he said. Speaking of the looting in downtown Portland, Herndon added: ""…if you think doing that is a way to express your rage … it's ineffective. If you think tearing up is going to help black people, you are sadly mistaken."" It is not a contradiction to lament the vandalism while also condemning in the strongest terms the racism that leads to institutional and ingrained mistreatment of people of color every day in this nation. Oregon, despite its sometimes-inflated self-regard, is no exception. A 2017 investigation by Pamplin Media Group and Investigate West showed that African Americans and Latinos in this state are more likely to be stopped by police, more likely to be ticketed and more likely to be charged with a bevy of crimes — from jaywalking and transit violations to theft and prostitution — than are white Oregonians. Racism is real, and it can have tragic and fatal consequences, as we have witnessed right here in Portland. The work to reform the justice system must continue in Portland. Peaceful protests can build public support and apply pressure on the mayor, police chief and City Council to improve training and practices. But there's a vast difference between protests and rioting. Organized protests have a goal. Rioting — shattering glass and lighting fires — is opportunistic and attention seeking. Negative behavior always draws the most scrutiny and, sadly, distracts the public from the legitimate grievances of those who protest peacefully. This weekend's rioting hurt Portland, physically and otherwise. Systemic racism and violence against people of color hurt everyone. And the combination is the last thing any of us needed after the economic devastation from the coronavirus. Now, among all the other tasks facing every one of us, is the question of how to move forward from the literal ashes.",0.0
1621892901,2020-05-31 20:21:39,Unrest demonstrates Biden's challenge in breaking through,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200531/unrest-demonstrates-bidens-challenge-in-breaking-through?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" President Donald Trump spent much of Sunday using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge 'law and order' and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. 'He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,' said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. 'America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it.' Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. There are some signs that Biden is looking to take on a more active role. On Sunday, his campaign released a photo of him visiting the site of protests in Wilmington. Biden, wearing a mask to protect from COVID-19, knelt down to talk to a man and a young child. 'The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,' Biden wrote in a message attached to the photo. 'And as President, I will help lead this conversation "" and more importantly, I will listen.' On Monday, Biden plans to venture out again to meet with community leaders in Wilmington. Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. 'What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,' she said. 'We're going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.' Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his 'Plan for Black America,' an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.'",0.0

Pat Dooris estimates around 2,500 people were in attendance. By 6:25 p.m. hundreds of people had arrived. 6:35 p.m. Police state their support of the peaceful gathering at Laurelhurst Park. 6:43 p.m. Protesters begin to leave Laurelhurst park and head into Southeast Portland. 7 p.m. One hour until Sunday night's curfew begins, another demonstration continues downtown. 7:07 p.m. Laurelhurst Park demonstrators move to SE 47th and Burnside and sit in the street.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a 'sacred space.' Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. 'I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,' he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

The group then walked on the road north toward the Marion Street Bridge, taking the on-ramp to the bridge and halting traffic for several minutes. Upkes said this represented a major confrontation for the city. Blocking traffic on the bridge is a ""hard line"" for the police, he said. They left as police began assembling at the base of the bridge, with a handful of protesters confronting an unhappy driver leaning on her horn and yelling at the marchers. It escalated to the point of one man striking the passenger side window, though several other protesters were there to pull him away and try to mollify the male passenger. Several police officers in riot gear appeared, but didn't intervene after the man was pulled away.

Upkes said police formed a line in front of the bridge as the protesters went that direction, and during the stand-off some threw glass bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers. Protesters yelled at their compatriots when fireworks were thrown, some vocally hoping to keep the demonstration peaceful. Officers returned fire with an assortment of tear gas, pepper balls, rubber projectiles, acoustic devices and spotlights. Many in the crowd reported getting hit by a projectile or inflicted by tear gas. At least one person appeared to be hit directly by a flashbang grenade.

Original story: A curfew for the entire city of Salem was reinstated Sunday night and will last until 6 a.m. Monday after at least 300 protestors marched through downtown showing support for George Floyd. The group marched in the middle of streets and blocked traffic They marched to the Marion Street bridge and briefly marched on the bridge. Signs proclaiming ""Black Lives Matter"" and urging support for Floyd are prominently displayed. Demonstrators are chanting: ""Say his name: George Floyd."" Some minor confrontations between drivers and marchers have occurred, but many marchers are quickly diffusing those incidents. Police were monitoring the event from a distance, but have taken more active actions. Several streets in the downtown area have been blocked, noisy 'disruption' sirens have been used and officers are telling demonstrators to go home. The group started at the state Capitol, marched around downtown and have now mostly returned to the Capitol grounds. Sunday's demonstration follows a messy incident Saturday night. That march, involving more than 200 demonstrators protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd, was largely peaceful for several hours. The evening began with a handful of people carrying Black Lives Matter signs standing in the rain on the Capitol steps. The march, which began at about 7 p.m. Saturday, took a turn after 11 p.m. when projectiles were thrown by individuals in the crowd toward officers near the intersection of Church Street NE and Court Street NE. Salem police spokesman Lt. Treven Upkes said police broke up the crowd and used tear gas after several explosive devices and hard objects were thrown. Just after midnight, Upkes warned that another round of tear gas would be used to break up the crowd.

1621954248,2020-05-31 23:45:00,"As Rallies Continue, Civic Leaders Confront Protests And Oregon’s Racist History",https://www.opb.org/news/article/black-lives-matter-rallies-portland-civic-leader-confront-protests-oregon-racist-history/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (June 1, 7:22 a.m. PT) — Protests rolled through Portland for a third night Sunday as civic leaders and elected officials grappled with how to respond to both increasingly large demonstrations and Oregon’s legacy of institutional racism. Jonathan Levinson/OPB A weekend of rallies, vandalism and pleas for change ended with a day of large demonstrations both downtown and on Portland’s east side. Thousands of people took to the streets. The vast majority engaged in peaceful protest, though another wave of vandalism broke out late in the evening. At one point Sunday afternoon, officers joined with the crowd downtown when they called on police to kneel with them in honor of George Floyd, the black man killed last week in Minneapolis when an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. Later, at a protest on the east side, several police liaison officers agreed to march with one group, prompting a chant of “We Are One.” The night grew tenser. Several times, police responded to people throwing glass bottles and other projectiles with tear gas and flash bang canisters. Just before 11 p.m., Portland Police tweeted that someone had broken windows at the downtown federal courthouse. Officers fired more tear gas and flash bang devices after that in an attempt to force the crowd to disperse. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Protesters returned but scattered again after someone shot fireworks. Police and officers responded with more tear gas, rubber bullets and a warning that anyone who stayed in the area would be subject to police use of force. That prompted more vandalism, including broken windows, graffiti and several small fires. The damage occurred as the police bureau tweeted a photo of Chief Jami Resch standing with several men whom the bureau said were organizing the rally and urging people to leave. Chief Resch and Capt. Lovell just met with some of the leaders involved in tonight’s protest. They asked PPB to get the message out that the violent acts were not what was intended for tonight. They asked for people to leave. pic.twitter.com/ALmj7rICVA — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) June 1, 2020 City leaders have struggled to find the best approach for allowing political protest while containing violence and damage to property. Business owners estimate damage from vandalism and looting over the weekend will total millions of dollars. Jonathan Levinson/OPB “It no longer feels like sincere mourning for the death of George Floyd and many other black men and women in this country,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said at the first of two press conferences he held Sunday. “This behavior we’ve seen for the second night is blatant lawlessness and selfish violence.” Later in the day, Wheeler met with black leaders in what the mayor’s office billed as a chance to address “the impact of the demonstrations in our black communities.” At that event, he said white leaders need to listen to understand what’s driving the protests: “Those of us here, who look like me, we have not been the best allies. … We have been too quiet. We have said the right words, but we haven’t followed through with the right actions.” Black leaders who spoke at the afternoon event asked that the focus be on the injustices that propelled protesters onto the streets. Jonathan Levinson/OPB “Today what doesn’t sit well with me — what’s not sitting well in my heart — is that in the face of staggering persistent and inhumane justice, the focus of the public story has been diverted to miscreants and disorder,” said Rukaiyah Adams, co-founder and chair of the Albina Vision Trust. (Editor’s note: Adams is on the board of directors of Oregon Public Broadcasting.) “Expressions of rage and pain — they may be visible, but they are not our whole truth. More than expressions of rage, what has happened since Mr. Floyd’s murder is a deep expression of love.” Other speakers said they understood the fury that had led to destruction in Portland and elsewhere; they were feeling that same rage. “I know that, for me, it personifies how I feel inside,” said Kali Ladd, the executive director of KairosPDX. “As wrong as it may be, it is a symbol of our shattering, our devastation, our internal beating every time we see a life lost like George Floyd.” Jonathan Levinson/OPB Joe McFerrin, president of the Portland Opportunities Industrialization Center and Rosemary Anderson High School, emphasized the root causes that have brought Portlanders onto the street: disparities in the way black and white Oregonians are treated. These disparities, he warned, will only be heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Multnomah County, people of color represent 40% of COVID-19 cases, despite comprising only 30% of residents, according to the county’s health authority. Racism and wide disparities between white people and people of color are frequent themes in Oregon history, from laws blocking people of color from owning property in the 19th and early 20th centuries to urban renewal projects that razed predominately black neighborhoods in the 1960s and 1970s to recent studies that show police routinely stop black residents far more often than whites. Civic leaders say the protests that have swept through Portland are a culmination of generations of frustration. Jonathan Levinson/OPB he Rev. Lenny Duncan, a pastor at Messiah Lutheran Church in Vancouver, Washington, helped lead the crowd through chants as he spoke against anti-black rhetoric: “I am tired of people talking about riots, and not talking about black lives,” he said. “Your Apple stores are not worth more than my family. “You can be outraged and talk to me about peace, but I refuse to accept a passive peace, which means that I see no justice in a few weeks when all this is over — when you’re able to go back to your job, and make it to a restaurant, and not care about me like you did last week.”",0.0

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. 'I think people are hurting and they're angry and they're trying to be heard because there's no other way to get anyone's attention,' Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

As chants of ""I can't breathe"" and ""George Floyd"" reverberated, thousands of protesters marched through downtown Portland Sunday evening, May 31, for a third straight night following the death of the unarmed, handcuffed black man under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Around 9 p.m., a crowd of about 3,000 protesters crossed the Burnside Bridge, where they were met with a heavy police presence. Protesters crossed the bridge and headed on Southwest Third Avenue, near the downtown Justice Center. At 8 p.m., when the city's curfew began, protesters who had been at the Justice Center were dispersed by police. Some protesters threw smoke bombs and water bottles at the police, who responded with flash bang grenades and tear gas. Protesters were seen picking up the flash grenades and throwing them back toward the police. For the most part, the protest was peaceful, with little chaos early in the evening. At around 8:10 p.m., police labeled the gathering an ""unlawful assembly."" Police began moving protesters back almost immediately. A phalanx of police gathered along Southwest Main Street and formed a line as protesters refused to leave. Tear gas canisters were released in a park near the Justice Center, which forced the crowd to move through the streets quickly. Milk was seen on the streets, a liquid used to take the sting out of the eyes from tear gas. Police then used multiple methods — cars, tear gas, possibly rubber bullets — to chase the crowd farther into different parts of downtown, not far from the Schnitzer Concert Hall. Protesters continued to move quickly away from the central city. Another group of protesters were walking from east Portland, down Burnside and toward downtown, near where other protesters ran. The eastside group had been relatively peaceful and stayed together as they headed toward downtown, but as the march began some of the people dropped off. When it began Shortly before 5 p.m. Portland police declared a ""civil disturbance"" after a large group gathered at Southwest Third Avenue and Main Street with multiple projectiles. The group of protesters began to march around that same time and police said they wouldn't interfere if the march remained civil. The march went from the Justice Center to Pioneer Courthouse Square, then back to the Justice Center. The group was large but, as of 6 p.m., remained peaceful. But around 7:30 pm., Portland police tweeted that there were ""a significant amount of protesters near the former SE Precinct. PPB will protect the safety and security of our building."" ""PPB is encouraging peaceful assembly tonight. Our liaison officers are working with organizers of the demonstration at the former SE Precinct to encourage them to continue to march.

PORTLAND, Ore — Outrage over systemic injustices and racism deeply rooted in our society are boiling over. African Americans and people of all colors and backgrounds are taking to the streets in cities across the country, peacefully protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. But as we've seen - including here in Portland - many feel that, alone, is not enough to get their message across and to evoke change. KGW caught up with African American business owners and young people in North and Northeast Portland on Sunday to get their feelings on the unrest transpiring here and around the nation. Perspectives are as diverse as each individual we talked to. “It’s always been a difficult time being black in America,” said Khiry Williams, who lives in Portland. “They haven't felt heard at all. It's the only way they're getting their attention and maybe somebody will listen this time. If not, don't be surprised if things get out of control even more.” Kee Nelson, the owner of food cart Kee’s Loaded Kitchen off Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd in Northeast, feels both peaceful protests and riots are necessary. “Stop killing us. Stop murdering us,” Nelson said. “If we keep walking up and down this street saying, ‘No peace, no justice, no peace’ without no action we are going to get the same continuous reactions. So it is what it is. A new generation is out here not playing no games.” A young woman we spoke to, who chose to remain anonymous, says it strikes a cord with her every time a black person dies in a law enforcement-related incident because it could have been her or her family. She says they can’t sit back and let the killing continue any longer. “I'd rather it be peaceful but what is going to enforce change?” she said. “Why do we have to prove our humanity? We can think, we can act, we can talk the same as you. We can put on our drawers the same as the next person. I don't understand why we're not being seen as that, why we have to fight so hard to be seen as that. It's not fair."" “If we just come together and unite as one and continue to push for change we can make something happen. But I know it's going to take a lot of work. Because we’ve been working at this for a very long time,"" she said through tears. The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police is one of countless injustices against black people in America. Naime Overton, a student at Grant High School, told us this incident added to her and her friends' and family's anger and made everyone more fed up. The community is sick and tired of being sick and tired. Portland's African American community doesn't want to see anyone hurt or small businesses, already struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, broken into or looted during the riots. Some people we spoke with don’t support the destruction, but support the cause behind the action; windows and buildings can be fixed, but you can’t bring back a human life. If people are more upset over Target getting destroyed than an unarmed black man’s life being taken, they said that's an issue. “I don't want no one's businesses destroyed or anything. But it's happened way too often where people want their voice heard and they want it heard now,” Word is Bond intern Ja’Mari Etherly said. Looking out across the crowds, many rioters aren’t black. African American community members, like Nelson, are proud of their allies standing up for something they believe in. “First of all, it’s about time you stood up for us. We been standing up for all y’all our whole life,” Nelson said. Unfortunately, a portion of those causing the chaos aren't there for the right reasons and just join in to wreak havoc. But the community doesn't want that to overshadow the message they need elevated. “We need to get back focused on what we're rioting for, who we’re rioting for, and the rights we're rioting for,” Overton added. “Hopefully this is a springboard to change the system from the inside out,” Williams added. ""It's terrible that we’re still revisiting these things and still trying to get our voices heard. Hopefully the change will come really soon. If not, action is going to continue to take place."" Along with Downtown Portland, rioters took over some streets in the Lloyd District Saturday night, busting the windows of several businesses. Portland police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered everyone to leave. The crowd dispersed around 2 a.m.",0.0

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0
1622029726,2020-06-01 00:19:30,Deadly police raid fuels call to end 'no knock' warrants,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/deadly-police-raid-fuels-call-to-end-no-knock-warrants?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) "" It's the stuff of nightmares: Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door. Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor's family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville's police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. 'These changes, and more to come ... should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,' Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor's address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city's top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. ""Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can't knock and announce,' Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor's mother says neighbors didn't hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor's trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn't know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family's home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation's war on drugs. They have become the 'norm' for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. 'It's an abuse of authority across the board,' said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who's been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn't always justified. 'If you're going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn't be there with a search warrant in the first place. It's not worthwhile,' said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. 'Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,' Kraska said. 'At the end of the day, banning them probably won't accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.' Kentucky has a 'stand your ground' law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven't protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker's dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor's death could be an 'ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,' Kraska said. 'These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,' he added. 'There's been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.' ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland. Sainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee.",0.0
1622029723,2020-06-01 01:08:39,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a 'transition' candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. 'The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,' an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. 'Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,' she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring 'you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.' ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,' she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. 'Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,' he said. 'I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.' Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. 'This is very tough timing for her,' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. 'It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,' said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.' ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

""Who do you protect? Who do you serve?"" Portland streets filled up — first with protesters, then with sirens — as crowds gathered Sunday, May 31, downtown and on the east side of the Willamette River for a third night of protests on matters at the intersection of race and law enforcement. Their chants and shouts of ""Who do you protect? Who do you serve?"" were aimed at police surrounding the Multnomah County Justice Center and throughout downtown. As night fell, an estimated 6,000 people massed in front of the Justice Center, raising their hands in the air, booing or crying out ""peaceful protest!"" when firecrackers or other disturbances occurred among the throng. But the truce did not last. Police pushed demonstrators away from the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse after announcing that they were investigating an attempted break-in. The federal courthouse was coated in spray paint during the event. Flashbang grenades and tear gas canisters were fired some time later — after police said officers were hit by projectiles and fireworks — causing protesters to flee in disorder throughout the central city. Then began a familiar game of cat-and-mouse, with small bands of protesters scurrying as squad cars and riot police vans flashed up and down the streets and avenues, ordering crowds to disperse until at least 1 a.m. — well after Mayor Ted Wheeler's 8 p.m. curfew. One man dressed all in black pried off a board from the front of Pioneer Place mall, while freshly broken glass could be observed at Portland Luggage, Foot Locker and the Sixth + Main office building.

Later, when one officer was given a megaphone by protesters, he said, ""We see how extremely important your message is to the distrust that has existed between the police and the community,"" KPTV reported. The Portland Police Bureau amplified sound car later announced, ""Please demonstrate your First Amendment rights, but do not destroy your city."" Police said 14 arrests were made during the protest. 'Reflecting community and understanding' Early Sunday, a gathering announced by PNW Youth Liberation Front brought several thousand protesters to Portland's tony Laurelhurst Park neighborhood. No crowd control weapons were used as the crowd approached the joint police bureau and sheriff's office Penumbra Kelly Building, 4747 E. Burnside St., leading to a prolonged stand-off. The column of protesters eventually made an hour-long march on Burnside back to downtown. During a 2 a.m. media briefing, Police Chief Jami Resch said that several sergeants took a knee outside the Justice Center in an ""organic moment.""   HUGE crowd in East Portland right now.

1622152216,2020-06-01 04:58:08,Portland Police Chief Resch speaks after 3rd night of protests,https://www.koin.com/news/portland/portland-police-chief-resch-addresses-media-following-protests/,en,False,,1406,koin cbs,http://www.koinlocal6.com/default.aspx,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Portland Police Chief Jami Resch spoke with media around 2 a.m. Monday morning following the city’s third consecutive night of demonstrations. During the press conference, Chief Resch said the majority of protesters were peaceful, mentioning the marchers who came from the Laurelhurst Park area specifically. Watch the full conference at the bottom of this article “It’s been a very long and difficult and emotional several days in Portland and across the country and we understand why,” said Resch in her opening remarks. “Yesterday’s events started peacefully and there was a very organic moment with some of our sergeants and some demonstrators who took a knee together next to the Justice Center.” “I’m very proud of this moment as it reflects community and understanding.” Portland police kneel to peaceful protesters outside Justice Center Between the two large groups of demonstrators—one near Laurelhurst Park and the other downtown, which eventually merged into one—Resch said they estimated there was roughly 6,000 people involved in Sunday’s largely peaceful protests. “Unfortunately, there were others who were intent on violence and destruction directed towards police and targeted buildings including the Federal Courthouse, the Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Justice Center, and the Multnomah County Courthouse,” said Resch. In terms of the acts of vandalism that police pursued, Resch singled those people out separate from the majority of protesters. Sunday night’s crowd was much larger than the past two nights of demonstrations, and she attributed the large crowd as what gave some individuals the opportunity to commit crime. Police made some arrests over the course of the demonstration. While Resch said the final reports on those arrests were still being finalized, she characterized them as criminal mischief and one instance of an attempted assault on an officer. Earlier in the evening, Portland Police liaisons met with community organizers to discuss the evening’s protest after crowds requested a meeting with law enforcement representatives. “I heard the leaders say that they want the police to meet with the community leaders and they do not feel that they are represented by the community leaders PPB meets with regularly,” said Resch. “We agreed that the majority of protesters and the police wanted a peaceful protest, and we are frustrated by those who are engaging in violence and destruction because it is not helpful at all in changing our efforts.” Resch said during that meeting, they discussed new ways leaders could engage with them, and vice versa. “I was very appreciative that they were able to take the time—that they were trusting enough to come into the precinct to meet with me,” said Resch. “They had some very good ideas on how police could engage with the community in ways that we haven’t before. It was a very good conversation, but it was cut a bit short by the actions of people who threw incendiary devices at officers.” Chief Resch and Capt. Lovell just met with some of the leaders involved in tonight's protest. They asked PPB to get the message out that the violent acts were not what was intended for tonight. They asked for people to leave. pic.twitter.com/ALmj7rICVA — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) June 1, 2020 The chief said they concluded that meeting with the intention to meet again.

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. 'Maybe they should try it on the front lines.' ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama, and Stafford from Detroit.",0.0

1622209581,2020-06-01 05:19:07,US heads into a new week shaken by violence and pandemic,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/us-heads-into-new-week-shaken-by-violence-and-pandemic?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation's governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

This brings Lane County’s total known case count to 76, with three deaths. Sixty-three of the people with positive cases have recovered. Ten are recovering at home, and one is hospitalized. A 62-year-old male from rural Lane County was the third recorded COVID-19 death in the county. He died on May 4, and had multiple preexisting conditions, according to a county press release. ""They initially tested positive for COVID-19 during a screening using a rapid test,"" the release stated, but a second lab test yielded a negative result.

Seven of these new known cases were identified by doing sentinel testing for the Latino community. Five were found to be connected to another COVID-19 case. Floyd protests could spark coronavirus outbreaks As people continue to protest following the death of George Floyd at rallies nationwide, officials are worried that the large gatherings will spark new coronavirus outbreaks. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, for example, warned that ""if you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week."" As of early Monday, the virus had killed more than 104,000 in the U.S. and more than 372,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There are more than 6.1 million confirmed cases across the globe and 1.7 million in the U.S. Civil unrest across the nation fueled by racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that ""if you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week."" Bottoms warned that ""there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers"" than white people. In Minneapolis, where a police officer faces a third-degree murder charge in the death of George Floyd, the Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. Said Mayor Jacob Frey: ""We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other."" Health experts fear carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place.

Starting Wednesday, Italy will allow travelers from the 25 other members of the Schengen visa-free travel area that covers much of Europe to come to Italy with no restrictions. But few are expecting large numbers to arrive – at least at first. Rome, which is home to nearly 3 million permanent residents, is hardly a ghost town, though. Kids kick soccer balls between the pillars of the ancient portico of the Pantheon, dog walkers circle Piazza Navona’s oval track, solitary pedestrians emerge from the shadows of majestic palaces, and tiny flowers sprout through the cobblestones of Campo de' Fiori.

The Netherlands reopened museums, and England saw some elementary classes return. – Eric J. Lyman, Special to USA TODAY Busy hurricane season + coronavirus pandemic = 'a cataclysmic scenario' Thanks to COVID-19, the hurricane season that officially starts Monday will be unlike any other. ""The combination of an ongoing pandemic and what NOAA has forecast to be a busy hurricane season is a cataclysmic scenario,"" according to the disaster policy group SmarterSafer Coalition. Federal forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month predicted as many as 19 named storms would form, of which as many as 10 will be hurricanes. It's just one of many forecasts that predict an unusually busy season in 2020. Even without the pandemic, this ""would be a challenging hurricane season,"" said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists, because of the predicted number of storms. ""As a nation, we're not prepared, and this is putting people's lives at risk."" – Doyle Rice, USA TODAY Latino homes report serious COVID-19 symptoms nearly twice as often A sweeping national survey believed to be the largest measurement of symptoms of COVID-19 has exposed a staggering ethnic divide as Hispanic are hit hard by the new virus. Since March, 1.6 million people have answered the basic question: Is anyone in your home experiencing symptoms ranging from a dry cough to difficulty breathing? Across the nation, Hispanic households said yes to symptoms of COVID-19 – the lung disease caused by the virus – nearly a third more often than others, a USA TODAY analysis found. When the list is narrowed to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified as the most serious pairs of ailments – dry cough and difficulty breathing, or fever and loss of taste or smell – the differences were far starker: Hispanics experienced them almost twice as often. – Kenny Jacoby and Marco della Cava, USA TODAY South Korea case spike sparks alarm South Korea has reported 238 cases of the coronavirus over the past five days, causing some worry as the country has eased social distancing rules, including opening schools.

According to the Yonhap News Agency, Monday's 35 new cases is a slight tick down after Thursday saw a two-month high of 75 cases. The news agency reported that some worries have been raised as nearly two dozen cases were traced to 13 small churches in Incheon, west of Seoul, and Gyeonggi Province surrounding the capital.

1622239592,2020-06-01 06:54:09,Police chiefs say training aids officers in protests,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/police-chiefs-say-training-aids-officers-in-protests.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Mihajlo Maricic/iStockBy LUKE BARR, ABC News  (NEW YORK) -- As the protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer rage on across the country, police departments are in the unique position of being the target of protesters and keeping those same people safe.  Demonstrations that started in Minnesota in the wake of Floyd's death on Memorial Day, have multiplied as well as escalated from peaceful to violent and police chiefs from departments of all different sizes told ABC News that they have had to rely on their training procedures to get through each wave.  Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said that her agency is focused on making sure that people can express themselves freely and without any reservations.  ""Part of it is making sure that we have the right training that we are able to approach this in a way that minimizes risk to the people who are, exercising their free speech but also minimizes risk to officers,"" Best explained to ABC News by phone.  ""Responding to civil disturbances like we have seen is always a complex and difficult situation for any police agency,"" Steve Casstevens, the president of the International Chiefs of Police told ABC News. ""It is easy to see the difficulties that situations like these present and the complexity of law enforcement's action in response -- which require a fine balance of response to the range of emotions and reactions -- while working to restore peace and prevent the further escalation of violence and destruction of property.""  Friday night in Oakland, California, one contracted Federal Protective Service (FPS) officer was shot and killed and another was wounded after a shooter opened fire on the federal building, the FBI told ABC News in a statement. A senior Department of Homeland Security official told ABC News that the shooting and the overnight protests were related, but the investigation is still in its preliminary stages.  On Saturday night, outside the White House, the Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Secret Service made 18 arrests. According to MPD, 11 officers were injured, with one sustaining a compound leg fracture.  More than 60 U.S. Secret Service uniformed division officers and special agents were injured during protests in Washington Friday night through Sunday morning. Eleven Secret Service employees were transported to local hospitals and treated for non-life threatening injuries during that period.  In Seattle, the police chief said in a statement that 27 people were arrested Saturday night during demonstrations in the downtown area. That same night in Miami, authorities said there were 44 arrests during protests.  Miami Chief Jorge Colina told ABC News that when the police department expects a lot of people, they don't immediately go out in riot gear but rather wait and asses the situation.  ""If I can avoid a confrontation, I want to avoid it. Obviously, you've got to protect property. You've got to protect life. And I understand that. But I can't stress enough how important it is to have those relationships built in where either the chief, or your community relations people can speak to the organizers, the unofficial leaders of those movements and say, hey, man, you too can be heard,"" Colina told ABC News.  Chief Edwin Roessler of Fairfax County, Virginia, stressed to ABC News that he also works with the community to quell tensions and provide support.  ""It comes down to having robust relationships with community advocates, regardless of their position. And we can't as police chiefs and police departments exclude anybody's opinion or use off-duty bias or implicit bias,"" Roessler said. ""We need to be aware, we need to work with everyone so if someone wants to exercise their first amendment rights in Fairfax County our goal is to work with that group, provide them a space and a place to do it.""  Roessler said that his department is always actively engaging with community leaders to better improve relations -- something that started when he first arrived as chief in 2013 because the police department was facing a challenge with transparency.  ""We know our advocates who helped us design the policy,"" he said, ""and we get to continually do that with each policy on an annual basis -- have a transparent report card on our web site.""  While ""pop-up protests"" don't provide time to plan for a large-scale demonstration, Roessler said there is a specific civil disturbance unit in Fairfax County, that trains for these types of incidents.  ""Sometimes you've got to use discretion. Just because they're blocking the road doesn't mean that you necessarily have to go lock everybody up. There's options, we could divert traffic and let the protest evaporate once (protesters) are satisfied,"" he said. ""You don't necessarily need to arrest your way out of that.""  On Friday morning, Americans woke to the news that a CNN reporter was arrested on live TV, and the police chiefs who ABC News spoke with said that while they did not want to judge without having been in the situation, they expressed frustration.  ""I'm sure that if you were to ask anyone in the Minneapolis Police Department, who has any rank, I can't imagine that anyone there was happy with the decision that was made by whoever was in charge in the field. And I hope that it wasn't even that. I hope it was just that officer who made that decision -- a bad one -- and not a decision from the leadership,"" Colina said.  Roessler said that as soon as he saw that video of the reporter getting arrested, he talked to his command staff to ensure that a situation like that doesn't happen in Fairfax County.  ""When I observed that immediately to my civil disturbance unit commander, that we need to make sure this doesn't happen to us, (Rossler urged the unit commander to) look at our policies, look at our training syllabus and make sure this is in the next level of training,"" he explained.  Best said that her department learned from instances like the 1999 protests of the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle.  ""We learned a lot of lessons then, which really was a milestone for our organization, in learning how to address some of these more volatile protests. We took a beating at that time in 1999. We have learned a lot of lessons since then about how to structure better,"" Best explained.  In a recorded message to Miami police officers, Colina called the video of Floyd's death ""disturbing"" and he told ABC News that it sets police back.  ""It puts us back as a profession, decades. And quite frankly, it's embarrassing as a nation,"" he said.  In Seattle, Best said that their goal during the protests is looking out for the safety of everyone.  ""On a human level we really want everyone to be safe, and I realize that people are very upset about the obvious indifference to human life that we saw, most recently, in Minneapolis, but generally speaking, the officers that come to work every day are just men and women trying to do the right thing and trying to do good work,"" Best said.

1622239590,2020-06-01 06:55:28,'We're sick of it': Protesters explain why violence has erupted across the US,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/were-sick-of-it-protesters-explain-why-violence-has-erupted.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesBy BILL HUTCHINSON, ABC News  (NEW YORK) -- Amidst the cries for justice, the violent clashes with police, the burning of squad cars and the looting businesses across the country, protesters like Arianna Evans took to the streets to denounce what they say have been years of racial injustice and brutality at the hands of law enforcement that has reached an American boiling point.  Outside the White House, where Secret Service agents battled with angry demonstrators to keep them from breaching the fence, Evans demanded justice over a megaphone. At the same time, she shouted down the more militant protesters bent on causing destruction and fueling the chaos that ignited after the death in Minneapolis of African American George Floyd, who died after a white police officer pressed his knee against the back of his neck. Images of the incident have since gone viral, as has a video of Floyd begging for his life and crying out, ""I can't breathe.""  Floyd was 47 years old.  ""I understand the need, the urge, the feeling to be violent and to just act, but we cannot progress if we do not sit down, come to the table, and get organized,"" Evans, a student from Washington, D.C., told ABC News outside the wrought iron fence of the White House on Saturday night.  ""That's all we can do at this point is organize, but if we keep just doing all of this, it's not gonna do anything but give them an excuse to keep shooting us in the street,"" she said of the protesters who took out their frustrations by throwing projectiles at police, setting fires or looting businesses in cities across the country over the weekend.  Through tears, Evans said the protesters are calling for financial and educational equality, and for ""a level playing field"" to strive for their American dreams.  ""All we're asking for is to be able to do the same thing that you get to do every day and walk outside of your house and know that maybe without... any other extenuating circumstances,"" Evans, who is African American, said referring to white people. ""Someday, I'll have a black son, and maybe one day a white cop will see him, and be scared out in front of a store, and shoot him... This is a problem that we need to fix. Right now, because if we do not, we're never going to get anywhere as a country.""  Protester Olga Hall told reporters that she joined the demonstrations in Washington, D.C. for one simple reason: ""We're sick of it.""  ""The cops are out of control,"" Hall said. ""They're wild. There have just been too many dead boys.""  Protests over Floyd's May 25 death erupted in violence in Minneapolis and quickly spread to major cities across the nation.  Minnesota prosecutors and police officials moved swiftly to fire Derek Chauvin -- the officer seen in a viral video with his knee on Floyd's neck -- and charge him with third-degree murder. Three other Minneapolis police officers, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who were also involved in the incident, were terminated from the police force.  But protesters coast to coast, and the family of Floyd, are calling for charges against Chauvin to be increased to first or second-degree murder and for the other officers to be charged as accessories to the killing.  The National Guard has been activated in Washington, D.C., and 17 states: Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Utah, North Dakota, California, Missouri, Virginia, Kansas, Illinois and Nevada. Demonstrations have also occurred beyond the United States, in London and Hong Kong.  ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities,"" Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz, a Democrat, said at a news conference on Saturday.  Police officers have used tear gas, rubber bullets and brute force in attempts to disperse unruly crowds, and they've come under scrutiny for allegedly attacking people who were protesting peacefully.  Authorities have also claimed that agitators have crossed state lines to wreak havoc.  ""The voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr said in a televised statement at the Department of Justice on Saturday.  ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr added. ""In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom traveled from outside the state to promote the violence.""  But protesters like Michael Santiago Render, a rapper better known by his stage name, Killer Mike, said he is the son of an Atlanta police officer and was among those protesting in the streets of Georgia's largest city.  Render spoke out on Friday at a news conference with Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the city's police chief, Erika Shields.  He said the original eight black officers in Atlanta 80 years ago had to dress in a YMCA because their white colleagues refused to dress with them.  ""Here we are 80 years later, I watched a white officer assassinate a black man and I know that tore your heart out and I know that's crippling,"" he said referring to the killing of Floyd.  He called on demonstrators to practice peaceful civil disobedience while calling for justice for Floyd and other African Americans whose deaths at the hands of U.S. police have resulted in the powder keg that is exploding in the streets of American cities.  ""I have nothing positive to say at this moment because I don't want to be here,"" Killer Mike said. ""But I'm responsible to be here because it wasn't just Dr. King and people who dressed nicely who marched and protested to progress this city and so many cities, it was people like my grandmother, people like my aunt.""  ""I'm duty-bound to be here to simply say that it is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy,"" he added. ""It is your duty to fortify your own house so that you might be a house or refuge in times of organization, and now is the time to plot, plan, strategized, organize and mobilize. It is time to beat up prosecutors you don't like at the voting booth. It is time to hold mayoral offices accountable, chiefs and deputy chiefs. Atlanta is not perfect, but we are a lot better than we ever were.""  In Los Angeles, protesting has turned into rioting and looting, all which has prompted the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors to impose a countywide curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Some areas, like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, are even starting their curfews earlier.  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom to bring in the National Guard to restore order.  One young African American woman who was seen wearing a face mask to help reduce the spread of coronavirus and holding a sign that read, ""No Justice, No peace"" at a protest, spoke candidly to ABC station KABC-TV in Los Angeles about the destruction she was witnessing.  ""The message that I want to get out is there is that there is a huge difference in America between white Americans and black Americans. They are treated very differently. And although I do not want white Americans to experience what we have experienced from the police, I want the police to come to an agreement with us to give us the same opportunity to have the same protection from them that white Americans have,"" the protester, who would only identify herself as Jane Doe, said.  ""We only want to be treated like people, that's it,"" she said, adding that she was born and raised in Los Angeles, is a law-abiding citizen with a college education and no criminal record. ""Police brutality is out of control. When a black person gets abused by the police it's like, OK, whatever, we have to riot. I saw a white woman punch a police officer and they so kindly asked her to detain herself until she fell and tripped and they zipped tied her. But a black man jaywalking is going to get pulled over and thrown to the ground. That's not OK.""  Asked if she was heartbroken over the destruction occurring in her city, she said, ""The damage is necessary. You know why? Because this is how we feel every day walking down the street. We don't get to see the beautiful buildings that everybody else gets to see. We get to feel like we don't belong there. We get to feel like trash. We get to feel like garbage. We get to feel like we can't come here.""  ""But we came here today because we want to be part of it. And if they don't want us to be part of it, we want you to see what our reality is like,"" she said. ""This is what we feel like when we walk down the streets. I'm afraid every time a police officer drives past me. Listen, it breaks my heart every day that I have to be afraid for my little brother and I have to be afraid for my little nephew. That breaks my heart.""  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0
1622248662,2020-06-01 08:32:54,George Floyd protests go international as demonstrations break out across the world,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/world-news/george-floyd-protests-go-international-as-demonstrations-bre.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Xinhua/ via Getty ImagesBy GUY DAVIES, ABC News  (LONDON) -- Hundreds of demonstrators were seen chanting and carrying Black Lives Matter signs outside a number of U.S. embassies in Europe and across the world over the weekend, as the protests against the killing of George Floyd spread internationally.  On Saturday and Sunday, crowds gathered outside the U.S. embassies in London and Berlin to protest against the death of Floyd and show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. with chants of “I Can’t Breathe” a regular feature of the weekend demonstrations.  In London, hundreds took part in a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration beginning with protesters taking a knee for nine minutes in Trafalgar Square before marching onto the U.S. Embassy.  ""Well, we've seen for hundreds of years black people and people of color be absolutely abused and killed on the streets and it's just getting worse and worse,” one London protester said. “We've had enough, and if they're not going to listen we're just going to scream louder and louder.”  London’s Metropolitan Police announced they arrested 23 people for “various offenses” across the U.K. capital on Sunday, and said they were on hand to make sure crowds complied with social distancing regulations.  Two black soccer players in Germany referenced the protests after scoring goals in weekend games. Jadon Sancho, an English player for Borussia Dortmund, wore a shirt underneath his jersey saying “Justice for George Floyd.” Marcus Thuram took a knee after scoring a goal for Borussia Mönchengladbach in tribute to the U.S. protests.  In Canada, thousands took to the streets in Vancouver and Montreal, echoing the chants heard across the U.S. in mostly peaceful protests Sunday. In the Montreal gathering, crowds were dispersed after projectiles were thrown at police later in the evening.  And in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, crowds chanting “I Can’t Breathe” were dispersed by police in riot gear outside the state government palace on Sunday as anti-government protests against police brutality in Brazil fed off the global sentiment felt by the killing of Floyd.  Last year in Rio, up to 1,402 people between January and September were killed by police, particularly in operations in the favelas, according to Human Rights Watch.  In Iran and China, two countries in which the U.S. has been heavily critical of human rights abuses, state run media and foreign ministers criticised the American handling of the George Floyd protests.  Manslaughter charges have been brought against Derek Chauvin, the white police officer accusing of kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes, and the National Guard has been activated in Minneapolis and 17 states.

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

As demonstrations and protests raged throughout downtown Portland, a Gresham Police officer shot and killed a man over the weekend while providing aid to his law enforcement colleagues by covering precincts in East Portland. During one emergency call, where a suspect was allegedly making threats, the Gresham officer fired shots and killed Israel Berry, 49, of Southeast Portland. According to Portland police, at about 9:35 p.m. Sunday, May 31, the Gresham officer responded to a call about a disturbance in the 12400 block of Southeast Kelly Street alongside several Portland officers. The Gresham officer shot Berry, who was pronounced deceased at the scene. At this time it is unclear what led up to the shooting, if Berry was armed, and what the nature of the threats were. The Portland officers on the scene were witnesses and did not deploy deadly force. The incident and shooting was not directly tied to the demonstrations, police said. The Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office determined the cause of death to be a gunshot wound. The Gresham officer was placed on critical leave, per department policy.

(KOIN) — Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced that the city-wide curfew will be extended Monday evening as the United States Attorney for Oregon called for the governor to enact the National Guard. On Sunday, as chants of “I can’t breathe” and “George Floyd” reverberated, thousands of protesters marched through the streets of downtown Portland for a third straight night following the death of the unarmed, handcuffed black man under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Wheeler and other city leaders took the podium beginning shortly after 8 a.m. on Monday, as they discussed how the city responded and how it will continue to respond going forward. Highlights of the press conference included Wheeler announcing an extension of the Portland curfew and U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams calling for the National Guard. “People are grieving, people are angry, and people are hurt,” he said. “Those emotions are now boiling over into the streets of America and right here in the streets of Portland. Last night for the third night in a row, thousands of protesters in our city demanded justice for people of color,” said Wheeler. “They deserve a space to deliver this important message and they deserve to be heard. Community leaders are listening, as your mayor, I am listening, your city commissioners are listening. Your police chief, fire chief, they’re listening too. They’re doing everything in their power to protect your right to protest to avoid confrontations. “But last night, a small number of demonstrators provoked conflict. Last night, a small handful of rioters continued to hurt our city, they were violent, they harassed reporters and threatened our first responders. They smashed windows. They started fires,” he said. “I want to be clear — they were a small handful from amongst thousands of peaceful demonstrators — the majority. I want to say again: thank you. I’m proud to stand with you seeking a just future for the people of color that our government is failing.” U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams called on the governor to enact the National Guard, saying “We need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence.” U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy J. Williams on June 1, 2020. Mayor Wheeler said he spoke to the governor multiple times throughout Sunday, asking for her to enact the guard. He said he believes the city does need more resources to address the protests. “I want to assure folks that if the National Guard is deployed in Portland, they will be deployed for the purpose of securing and protecting our facilities and to free up law enforcement who is trained in crowd management to be deployed throughout the community,” said Wheeler. “We would not calling for the deployment of the National Guard throughout the community.” After a bit of an explanation into his reasoning behind imposing curfews, Wheeler announced there will be a curfew in effect on Monday night. “I am not stupid — I know that when you impose a curfew that does not in of itself cause anyone to make the decision to not participate in a protest or demonstration. I acknowledge that in some cases it might encourage it. So why do this? It sends a message to the broader community that it is not the time to come downtown.” Wheeler touched on some of the emotional moment that unfolded on Sunday between some police and protesters. “Officers kneeling alongside demonstrators to show respect and solidarity. Our Chief of Police, Chief Resch and Portland Police Bureau Leadership, meeting with the leaders of the demonstrations. working together to encourage a message of peace and nonviolence. As your mayor and as your police commissioner and as a father — and as the person responsible for the safety of everyone in this city, I do not believe that violence or destruction is the answer to healing the deep racial wounds, harming Portland and America. “I implore you to take your justifiable anger and frustration and channel it into the hard work ahead. Lay bare the difficult truths we must hear. and own. Work alongside the phenomenal leaders in Portland’s black community — whom I had the great honor of joining yesterday to talk about our mutual path forward. “Justice starts with us, because we all have a role to play,” he said. “As long as these demonstrations continue, I will stand in front of you every morning. I hope that I can always tell you ‘this morning, Portland is safe,'” said Wheeler. “But we cannot stop at limiting property damage or preventing injuries or deaths during protests. while that type of safety is important is not enough. to achieve true safety, we must make this city safe for every person who lives, works or visits here. We must reach a day where I can stand before you and say Portland is safe and have that ring true for a black community. “Yesterday as I had the privilege of standing with my friends and colleagues, black leaders who shared their hopes, their wisdom, their pain, their believes and a path forward for America — as their friend and as the mayor of a hurting city, I promised to continue creating spaces for black voices to be centered and elevated and we’re going to do exactly that. Our team is working as I speak on this and whether it takes the form of town halls or community gatherings or something else, we are going to creating that space until we have lasting institutional reform and changing systems across all government. More to come soon on that point.” PPB Deputy Chief Chris Davis was in attendance as well, speaking about what authorities saw throughout Sunday. “Yesterday we saw people at their very worst — and we saw people at their very best,” said Davis.

A driver tried to drive through the crowd but was turned away by protesters who slashed his tires and smashed his window. Minutes later the mood seemed to change. Protesters broke windows at the Federal Courthouse. Authorities said fires were set inside and police will now use “riot control agents.” The demonstrators were not able to get inside the courthouse. Protesters threw projectiles, chanted “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” and heard the police say that anyone who throws projectiles is subject to arrest. Deputy Chief Davis said that it was a “very large number of projectiles” and went on for several hours. PPB Deputy Chief Chris Davis on June 1, 2020.

We acknowledge the pain in our communities of color — that we have to recognize that our profession through its history has a role in. We remain committed to the change we need to make and as the police bureau, we remain committed to serving all Portlanders.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades.

Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Also in Fort Lauderdale, the state attorney's office fired a prosecutor Monday for calling demonstrators 'animals"" at the zoo in a quickly deleted Facebook post. In the officer's case, colleagues quickly pushed him away from the woman and down the street Sunday. Police and city officials said it happened as a peaceful demonstration attended by about 1,000 people was dispersing, and smaller groups broke some store windows and sprayed graffiti. Police Chief Rick Maglione did not defend the actions of Officer Steven Pohorence, but said Monday that Pohorence pushed the woman after he and other officers had just rescued one colleague who had become surrounded and another from a patrol car that people began jumping on. Maglione said Pohorence's actions will be investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement before an internal investigation is conducted. Maglione said he understands why some believe the shove provoked the crowd to throw bottles, but he said there were people in the crowd with bricks, bottles, fireworks and other weapons who were hoping to start a fight with officers. 'I don't think (Pohorence's) action created what occurred,' the chief said. But he said Pohorence's actions 'could have added to what was going on,"" and he commended Officer Krystle Smith who pushed Pohorence away from the woman. 'She did what you are supposed to do: When you see either adrenaline or emotion or some kind of interaction going south ... that is our job to do, is intervene,' he said. Police declined to make Smith available for an interview Monday. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said he felt the Pohorence's actions were 'offensive,' and he's happy the department has suspended him. Demonstrator Samantha Sweeting Davis said she didn't see the shove, but heard yelling, then saw about six police cars arrive with sirens on. Then she saw bottles being thrown at officers, heard an explosion, and tear gas burned her eyes and throat. It was upsetting to see that kind of behavior from an officer who is supposed to 'protect and serve,' the 29-year-old high school counselor from Fort Lauderdale said. 'Suspension is a great first step, but honestly I want to see the officer de-badged."" The Fort Lauderdale Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents the city's officers, declined comment Monday. Meanwhile, the State Attorney's Office in Broward County, fired prosecutor Amy Bloom for writing on Facebook: 'Act civilized and maybe things will change. I've never seen such animals except at the zoo.' She said her description applied to protesters regardless of race. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Bloom quickly deleted the post, but someone copied it and it eventually reached her bosses. The State Attorney's Office confirmed the firing in a statement, saying her views are 'entirely inconsistent' with its 'ideals and principles.' Bloom said Monday on Facebook that she realized the post could be misinterpreted, deleted it within seconds and that ""I believe in justice for all and that ALL lives matter."" A curfew remains in effect in Broward County. Elsewhere in Florida, mostly peaceful protests were held over the weekend, but some Miami police cars were burned and storefronts damaged. That led Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez to postpone Monday's reopening of the county's beaches after a coronavirus shutdown. In Orlando, Police Chief Orlando Rolon said Monday that officers had to fire tear gas Sunday night after some demonstrators started throwing objects found at a highway construction site. He said his officers made 30 arrests Sunday night, including some who broke into stores. At one point during Sunday's protests, Rolon and Orange County Sheriff John Mina knelt in solidarity with protesters outside the Orlando Police Department. In Tampa on Monday, six members of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity prayed outside two businesses, Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant and Champs Sports, that were destroyed by arson on Saturday. Pastor James Gallon said the people who were destructive were from elsewhere.

1622426033,2020-06-01 10:30:30,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-local-church-amid-unrest?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville.

Starting Wednesday, Italy will allow travelers from the 25 other members of the Schengen visa-free travel area that covers much of Europe to come to Italy with no restrictions. But few are expecting large numbers to arrive – at least at first. Rome, which is home to nearly 3 million permanent residents, is hardly a ghost town, though.

Federal forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month predicted as many as 19 named storms would form, of which as many as 10 will be hurricanes. It's just one of many forecasts that predict an unusually busy season in 2020.

Across the nation, Hispanic households said yes to symptoms of COVID-19 – the lung disease caused by the virus – nearly a third more often than others, a USA TODAY analysis found.

1622426018,2020-06-01 10:35:15,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.registerguard.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0
1622430507,2020-06-01 10:00:00,Why some police officers stood with protesters outraged over George Floyd's death,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/why-some-police-officers-stood-with-protesters-outraged-over.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesBy ALEXANDRA SVOKOS, ABC News  (NEW YORK) -- As images of police officers in riot gear clashing with protesters in response to the death of George Floyd proliferated from across the country, a very different theme emerged from several cities.  Instead of lining up in opposition to the protesters, some police officers joined them.  ""I never thought of anything else, to be honest,"" Camden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki told ABC News.  For Camden, New Jersey, a city that had long been known for high crime rates, the police demonstrating alongside protesters in an ultimately peaceful event was not just a one-day phenomenon, but the continuation of years of efforts to bridge ties with residents since 2013, when the county police department took over public safety from the city's police agency.  ""We were basically able to start a new beginning,"" Dan Keashen, communications director for Camden County, told ABC News. That new beginning included an emphasis on everyday community policing.  ""It's a community, and we're part of the community. It's not us policing the city; it's us, together,"" Wysocki said.  When officials in Camden learned plans for a demonstration were coming together, the police were able to get involved and join in because of the community ties they had made.  ""I know that all cops aren't bad, so once I heard that they wanted to get involved, I was like, 'Sure, let's go for it, we can stand in solidarity,'"" Yolanda Deaver, a local hair salon owner who organized the demonstration, told ABC News, adding that it was ""really moving"" to have officers as well as lawmakers standing behind her with shared beliefs about injustice.  ""If you haven't been out in the community, if you haven't been working alongside residents and civic stakeholders, you're not going to have that credibility,"" Keashen said. ""People know who the chief is; the chief has been in their church, the chief has been in their community center.""  ""They were like, 'This is your march, we're marching behind you, you lead the way,' and that's what we did,"" said Deaver, who added she's thinking of holding another demonstration given the success of this one.  Following the protests on Saturday, images of Wysocki walking with demonstrators, holding a banner reading, ""standing in solidarity,"" spread across social media.  So, too, did images of police officers in Santa Cruz, California, Norfolk, Virginia, and other cities.  ""SCPD is fully supportive of peaceful protests @CityofSantaCruz and we always keep them safe,"" the Santa Cruz Police Department tweeted. Police there were seen taking a knee alongside protesters in solidarity against the killings of unarmed black people.  Police Chief Andy Mills and Santa Cruz Mayor Justin Cummings were at that protest, which stayed peaceful, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel.  ""Our cops are smarter, more aware of personal bias, and are more willing to police justly than my generation,"" Mills wrote in an op-ed published Sunday. ""Our new generation of Santa Cruz cops are more enlightened about race, and this will help to improve how we police.""  In Norfolk, Police Chief Larry Boone joined the protesters, carrying a sign that read, ""Black Lives Matter,"" according to ABC affiliate WVEC.  In Flint, Michigan, protesters marched to the Flint Township Police Department, where they were met by cops in riot gear, according to MLive. But after conversations between protesters and police, the demonstrations remained peaceful.  ""We want to be with y'all, for real,"" Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson said to cheers from demonstrators, with video from Mid-Michigan Now showing the sheriff taking off his helmet and laying it on the ground along with his baton. ""So I took my helmet off, they laid their batons down. I want to make this a parade, not a protest.""  ""I knew that the benefit far outweighs the risk,"" Swanson told ""Good Morning America"" of the decision to take off the gear. ""And when you show action of, 'Listen, I'm going to make myself vulnerable in order to come into your circle and show you that I want to be that solution,' that was the change maker right there.""  He continued, ""The community puts a lot of trust and faith in us, and we can't sit there and hold back -- we need to make sure we do what we need to do to hear the community and to respond.""  Across the river from Camden in Philadelphia, protests turned violent, with over 100 arrests by the end of Saturday night. But in Camden, the situation remained calm.  ""Me marching with the protesters is a form of de-escalation, it's a partnership with the community,"" Wysocki said. ""They have to see that I stand with them, and I do.""  ""Once the police officers said they feel the same way and they're walking with us, that's what made, I think, the crowd and everyone else feel comfortable,"" Deaver, the organizer, said. ""The police that were there, they weren't standoffish. They weren't holding their batons, they didn't have their hands on their holster or their guns. They were standing down. They weren't agitating the crowd or anything; they let people speak, there was no pushing, no shoving or anything.""  The protests, which were sparked after the death of Floyd, a black man who was pinned down by a white officer in Minneapolis on Monday, called for the end of police brutality against black people.  In Camden, part of the police's ""new beginning"" also included developing ""a very progressive use-of-force policy"" along with NYU School of Law's Policing Project, Wysocki said: ""It mandates the sanctity of life. Force is a last resort. De-escalation is mandated.""  ""It's not just a policy,"" Wysocki said. ""We train with it every day. It's constant reinforcement. You can have a perfect policy, but if you don't constantly train, it's forgotten.""  Excessive force complaints in Camden have seen a 95% drop since 2014, with just three complaints each in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, violent crime rates, too, have come down in the city.  At the conclusion of Saturday's demonstration, police held what they call a pop-up barbecue for residents, including hot dogs, hamburgers and a Mister Softee ice cream truck. Officers are doing more barbecues on Sunday, Wysocki said.  ""There's no alternative. We can't impose our will on a community. It's the community and the police together, and that's what we're doing in Camden,"" Wysocki said.  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Police shut down roads and fired tear gas on the group twice. The night’s actions followed a day of lawful protest where thousands of people flooded Eugene’s streets to support the Black Lives Matter movement. ""We had a largely lawful protest earlier today, where organizers worked to provide a safe framework for their free speech,"" said Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner in a Monday news release. ""Later, there was a group that appeared to have a different set of goals. ""These protesters we have been seeing as daylight falls appear to be younger and excited about creating conflict,"" he said. ""This comes at a cost to the community. Our local businesses and residents can’t afford and don’t deserve to have to pay for what occurs when mobs get out of control."" The conflict started at about 8 p.m. when a group of protesters gathered at Broadway and Olive Street, according to the news release. The group grew to about 50 people with some sitting in the street and some hitting light poles with hammers to make noise. The majority of people left after police told them to disperse, but some stayed. Police deployed tear gas at about 8:20 p.m. at 10th Avenue and Willamette Street. One person was arrested at this point in the night. A crowd then later formed at Kesey Square and three people were breaking mailboxes. Four were arrested at this point. Protesters continued to gather at East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street, so police shut down the Ferry Street Bridge. The city of Eugene also extended its temporary curfew to apply citywide at 11 p.m., which was announced via a press release at 10:59 p.m. ""Multiple people"" were arrested for acting as aggressors, according to the release. Police told people to disperse and deployed more gas at Kincaid Street and East 14th Avenue around 11:11 p.m. A video of the event captured by The Register-Guard shows police firing a gas canister directly at Henry Houston, a Eugene Weekly reporter, standing alone in the parking lot. EPD released a list of those arrested during the Sunday night protest. They were between the ages of 20 and 47, and the majority were arrested for curfew order violations. Four additional people were arrested on Saturday. Six of those arrested Sunday had Eugene addresses, one was from Springfield and the other four were listed as ""city unknown"" or ""no address."" The four arrested Saturday were from Eugene and Springfield. Skinner said a lot of people traveled to Eugene to participate in Sunday’s events. ""We’ve seen people travel into Eugene to take advantage of certain aspects of the demonstration or protesting, both for the right reasons and wrong reasons, unfortunately,"" he said. Eugene saw its first incident of the weekend Friday night when what began as a Black Lives Matter protest devolved into a massive bonfire in the street and looting of restaurants and businesses on West Seventh Avenue. But as with Sunday’s protests, Skinner said the instigators of the destruction were not connected to the peaceful protests earlier, and it was unclear whether the Friday provocateurs were affiliated with a group. ""There was no indication that it was organized Antifa or anarchists that were behind that,"" Skinner said. ""The instigators we had on Friday night were largely white young men and women. So I think unfortunately people have a tendency to want to lump this into a Black Lives Matter movement that is responsible for some of this violence and we’re just not seeing that at all. Our communities of color have been loud and proud and they’ve also been very respectful and lawful in the way they’ve been communicating."" Skinner said several agencies assisted this weekend, including Springfield Police Department, Eugene Springfield Fire Department and Lane County Sheriff’s Office. Many Eugene police officers were called in on their normal days off or to work overtime, and even those typically in the field less often, such as detectives, were pulled in to assist with control.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

The president and Attorney General William Barr used the word ""dominate"" nearly a dozen times in describing how law enforcement should posture themselves.  ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" Trump said, according to a recording of the call obtained by ABC News. ""They're gonna run over you, you're gonna look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.""  ""You have to know what you're dealing with,"" the president told the nation's governors. ""And it's happened before, this happened numerous times and the only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak.""  Trump said they were making a mistake by letting looters destroy property and called for arresting and prosecuting those captured on camera, saying they should be put in jail for 10 years.  ""Law enforcement response is not gonna work unless we dominate the streets, as the president said, we have to control the streets,"" Barr added in his own set of remarks. ""We have to control the crowds and not to react to what's happening on the street and that requires a strong presence.""  A senior DOJ official said Monday that Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to send riot teams to Miami and Washington, D.C., to assist in crowd control efforts. Around midnight Sunday, Barr dispatched the FBI’s elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) to assist D.C. police. The official said DOJ will “maximize federal law enforcement presence in D.C. tonight.”  Barr told the governors that DOJ has information of instigators who are ""looking for secondary targets and cities where they can go and overwhelm the police forces,"" which he said was a reason for all states collectively to show a strong response to protesters.  ""That’s why it’s so imperative we can’t play whack-a-mole with these people,"" Barr said. ""We have to take out the professional instigators and the leadership group and the way to do that is to start with a strong statement in the major cities.”  President Trump on the call accused many of the governors of being slow to call for federal help like the National Guard in their states.  ""Why you're not calling them up I don't know -- but you making a mistake and making yourselves look like fools.""  ""These are terrorists,"" President Trump said of the protesters. ""Antifa and the radical left.""  In his opening remarks, he made no mention of George Floyd, the African American man killed in police custody last week in Minneapolis, and did not address the protesters concerns about racial inequality.  At one point, Trump compared the government's mobilization in response to the protests so far as similar to a war-like posture.  ""It's like we're talking about a war which it is a war in a certain sense, and we're going to end it fast so be tough,"" Trump said.  While many of the governors on the call avoided directly criticizing the president over his response to the protests, Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker confronted Trump over his recent rhetoric, saying he was in many cases making the situation ""worse.""  ""I've been extraordinarily concerned about the rhetoric that's been used by you,"" Pritzker said. ""It's been inflammatory and it's not okay for that officer to choke George Floyd to death, but we have to call for calm. We have to have police reform called for.""  Pritzker added, ""the rhetoric that's coming out of the White House is making it worse. People are feeling real pain out there. And we've got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we’re addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protesters. That will help us to bring order.""  Trump shot back, defending his comments made thus far about Floyd and attacking Pritzker over his response to the spread of coronavirus in Illinois.  ""I don't like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus and I don't like your rhetoric much either,"" Trump said. ""I think you could have done a much better job, frankly, but that's okay we know we don't agree with each other.""  Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills similarly used the call to express concern over reports that Trump might visit her state later this week.  ""I am very concerned that your presence may cause security problems for our state,"" Mills said. ""We don’t have them yet so I’m concerned about that.""  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

(KOIN) — Police in Eugene said they were forced to use gas to dispel a mob of protesters in Eugene Sunday. As a result, Sunday night’s demonstration netted several arrests in the third night of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of about 50 protesters began making its way to the intersection of Olive and Broadway around 8 p.m., according to police. Members of the mob began hitting light poles with a hammer to make noise, eventually dispersing upon the arrival of more officers. “We had a largely lawful protest earlier today, where organizers worked to provide a safe framework for their free speech,” said Chief Chris Skinner. “Later, there was a group that appeared to have a different set of goals. These protesters we have been seeing as daylight falls appear to be younger and excited about creating conflict.” Later on, a group of 50-60 protesters reassembled at the intersection of 8th and Mill where it blocked traffic, forcing police to shut down traffic on the nearby Ferry Street Bridge. “Although the crowd moved from 8th and Mill, they did not disperse, but continued to move together as a unit toward 13th and Alder,” according to the police report. “Multiple people who were serving as aggressors were arrested. Gas was deployed at Kincaid and 14th around 11:11 p.m. A whole group was still moving around the 15th and Lincoln area at 11:45 p.m.” Like Portland and Salem, the City of Eugene enacted a temporary nighttime curfew in the downtown corridor on from 9 p.m. Sunday through 6 a.m. Monday. During the restricted hours, people are not allowed to travel on any public street or in any public place in that area. Prohibited travel includes automobile, bicycle, foot, public transit and any other mode of personal transportation, according to police. City officials have not stated yet whether a curfew will be in place Monday night.",0.0

What do we tell our children?,https://www.registerguard.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0
1622531093,2020-06-01 12:13:08,"Violence-stricken US cities clean up, brace for more unrest",https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/violence-stricken-us-cities-clean-up-brace-for-more-unrest?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation's governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

1622586686,2020-06-01 13:50:36,"As Pride Month gets underway, the LGBQT+ community mobilizes against racism",http://abcnewsradioonline.com/national-news/as-pride-month-gets-underway-the-lgbqt-community-mobilizes-a.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Anna Sergeeva/iStockBy TONY MORRISON, ABC News  (NEW YORK) -- In a largely unprecedented move during an extraordinary time in our nation’s history, more than 100 LGBQT+ organizations have united in solidarity to combat racial violence and injustice as Pride Month gets under way.  Calling out history, that it was LGBQT+ individuals of color who essentially sparked the gay liberation movement in the 1960s, leaders from many of America’s most prominent LGBTQ+ and civil rights groups banned together to say, “We understand what it means to rise up and push back against a culture that tells us we are less than, that our lives don't matter.”  Amid what is typically a time to celebrate the accomplishments and progress of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, queer, trans and more in our country, the community has fully mobilized to support the real-time efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement and to amplify the voices of protestors marching after the death of George Floyd.  While condemning racism, racial violence and police brutality, “The LGBTQ community knows about the work of resisting police brutality and violence,” the open letter reads.  Sarah Kate Ellis, president of LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD, told GMA, “It is all of our responsibility to speak out publicly against racism, systemic injustice, and police brutality, and to elevate voices and amplify stories of people of color, especially with the LGBTQ community.”  “We know that social change is often built on the pain and outrage of moments like the ones we are seeing in America today,” she said. “It is important to remember that the revolutionary riots at Stonewall in 1969 were spearheaded by many LGBTQ people of color, and that none of the progress made for the acceptance and equality of LGBTQ people over the past 51 years would be possible if not for the action and courage of those protestors,” Ellis added.  Ellis went on to tell GMA how this Pride Month will undoubtedly be completely different: “We’ll be centering and lifting up the voices of queer people of color, whose struggles are shared by the entire LGBTQ community. There can be no pride if it is not intersectional. We are, Together in Pride.”  The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), who coordinated the open letter, echoed GLAAD and told GMA, “Pride Month reminds us of our roots in struggle.""  “We honor the uprisings against police brutality at Stonewall and elsewhere,"" said HRC president Alphonso David. ""And we celebrate the fact that today many more of us may live as our true selves in the open."" .@HRC and more than 100 LGBTQ organizations are joining together to send a clear message and take action against systemic violence, racism and police brutality faced by the Black community. #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/UJPNG4ZiCS — Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) May 30, 2020 “This year, as righteous protesters march the streets across America to affirm that black lives matter, the LGBTQ community joins with them in combating racism,” David said.  On the matter of LGBTQ+ youth of color affected with events of current day, Amit Paley, CEO and executive director of The Trevor Project, calls out America’s young people as particularly vulnerable during this time of social and racial unrest. “We know from our research that black LGBTQ youth experience rates of depressed mood and suicidality similar to all LGBTQ youth however, despite having similar rates of mental health disparities, black LGBTQ youth are significantly less likely to receive professional care,” Paley told GMA. The senseless & unjust killings of Black Americans must stop. This racial violence is causing fear, pain, & anger among so many, including LGBTQ youth of color. @TrevorProject wants you to know that we see you & are here for you 24/7. https://t.co/vBSIuJPg1A — Amit Paley (@amitpaley) May 29, 2020 As the head of America’s leading national organization focused on crisis and suicide prevention efforts among LGBTQ+ youth, Paley aims to advocate for LGBQT+ youth that they are not alone and told GMA that crisis counselors are available for LGBTQ+ youth and LGBQT+ youth of color during this time. ""Trained and always available to support the unique needs of black LGBTQ young people, 24/7 and for free,"" Paley said.  Read the full letter:  LGBTQ Organizations Unite to Combat Racial Violence  “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” Those words, written over 30 years ago by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, remind us that indifference can never bridge the divide of hate. And, today, they should serve as a call to action to all of us, and to the Movement for LGBTQ equality.  This spring has been a stark and stinging reminder that racism, and its strategic objective, white supremacy, is as defining a characteristic of the American experience as those ideals upon which we claim to hold our democracy — justice, equality, liberty.  We listened to the haunting pleas of George Floyd for the most basic of human needs — simply, breath — as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled with cruel indifference on his neck. We felt the pain of Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend as he called 9-1-1 after plainclothes Louisville police kicked down the door of their home and shot her eight times as she slept in her bed. We watched the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery by white vigilantes in Brunswick, GA, aware that they evaded the consequence of their actions until the video surfaced and sparked national outrage. We saw the weaponizing of race by a white woman who pantomimed fear in calling the police on Christian Cooper, a Black gay man bird-watching in Central Park. We have heard and read about the killings of transgender people -- Black transgender women in particular — with such regularity, it is no exaggeration to describe it as a epidemic of violence. This year alone, we have lost at least 12 members of our community: Dustin Parker, Neulisa Luciano Ruiz, Yampi Méndez Arocho, Monika Diamond, Lexi, Johanna Metzger, Serena Angelique Velázquez Ramos, Layla Pelaez Sánchez, Penélope Díaz Ramírez, Nina Pop, Helle Jae O’Regan, and Tony McDade. All of these incidents are stark reminders of why we must speak out when hate, violence, and systemic racism claim — too often with impunity — Black Lives.  The LGBTQ Movement’s work has earned significant victories in expanding the civil rights of LGBTQ people. But what good are civil rights without the freedom to enjoy them?  Many of our organizations have made progress in adopting intersectionality as a core value and have committed to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. But this moment requires that we go further — that we make explicit commitments to embrace anti-racism and end white supremacy, not as necessary corollaries to our mission, but as integral to the objective of full equality for LGBTQ people.  We, the undersigned, recognize we cannot remain neutral, nor will awareness substitute for action. The LGBTQ community knows about the work of resisting police brutality and violence. We celebrate June as Pride Month, because it commemorates, in part, our resisting police harassment and brutality at Stonewall in New York City, and earlier in California, when such violence was common and expected. We remember it as a breakthrough moment when we refused to accept humiliation and fear as the price of living fully, freely, and authentically.  We understand what it means to rise up and push back against a culture that tells us we are less than, that our lives don't matter. Today, we join together again to say #BlackLivesMatter and commit ourselves to the action those words require.  Affirmations, Dave Garcia, Executive Director  AIDS Foundation of Chicago, Aisha N.

1622589343,2020-06-01 15:27:15,Mayor Wheeler asks Gov. Brown for Oregon National Guard activation. Again,http://rssfeeds.kgw.com/~/625776242/0/kgw/local~Mayor-Wheeler-asks-Gov-Brown-for-Oregon-National-Guard-activation-Again,en,False,,1407,kgw nbc,http://www.kgw.com/,"""Leaders are working as hard as they can to give protesters the right to assemble peacefully,"" Mayor Wheeler said at a Monday morning news conference. PORTLAND, Ore. — After three nights of unrest in downtown Portland, Mayor Ted Wheeler addressed the community Monday morning. He extended a curfew that's been in place since Friday and he reiterated U.S. Attorney Billy Williams' request for Gov. Kate Brown to activate the Oregon National Guard. Governors in 23 states and the mayor in Washington D.C. have brought in National Guard troops to help with civil unrest, with about 17,000 active troops nationwide. Wheeler said he asked Gov. Brown three times on Sunday for National Guard help, and that she offered alternatives. He asked again on Monday. When U.S. Attorney Williams was asked by a reporter during the Monday morning briefing whether activating the Oregon National Guard could exacerbate the situation, he said, ""That's always a potential, but at some point you have to do the right thing and right now our law enforcement partners are in desperate harms way. ""Is there a risk? Yeah, there's a risk everyday and sometimes you just have to accept it and draw a line in the sand and do everything you can to support law enforcement."" Wheeler later echoed the sentiment. ""I agree with what the U.S. Attorney said: We do need more resources, more people. I want to be clear to those who serve in the National Guard, I respect the difference between the mission of the National Guard and local issues,"" he said. ""If the National Guard is deployed, they'd protect facilities. Crowd control and policing will be left to law enforcement who are trained for that. The National Guard are our citizen soldiers. They're from here, live here."" On Sunday night, an estimated 6,000 protesters took to the streets in a peaceful demonstration. But at about 11:30 p.m. police said the protest had become an unlawful assembly and declared it a civil disturbance. ""Emotions are boiling over in the streets of America and in the streets of Portland,"" Mayor Wheeler said Monday morning. He said leaders are working as hard as they can to give protesters the right to assemble peacefully. ""They deserve to be heard. I am listening. Your police chief and fire chief are listening,"" he said. ""But last night a small number of demonstrators provoked conflict. ""Those who demonstrated peacefully, I want to say thank you. I'm proud to stand with you,"" he said. ""I do not believe violence or destruction is the answer to heal the deep racial wounds in America."" The mayor also said he looks forward to working alongside the phenomenal black leaders in Portland to find solutions to the inequities that have long targeted people of color. He said as long as the demonstrations continue, he will provide updates the following morning to let people know that Portland is a safe place. ""I've promised to keep creating space for black voices to be elevated and sacred,"" he said. ""We will continue to create that space until we have lasting change."" He reiterated that there were a few moments that gave him hope, like the scene of police officers kneeling with protesters in downtown Portland. Raw video: Portland police officers kneel with protesters Portland Police Deputy Chief Chris Davis said during the press conference that he saw people at their very worst, and at their very best. ""Our strategy was: Whatever happened, it would not be the police bureau that was the cause,"" he said. ""We saw broken glass at the Justice Center, then after that protesters threw projectiles at officers and very large mortars."" ""If you continue to demonstrate, do so peacefully,"" he said. ""This is your home, this is our home. Help us move our community in a positive direction."" Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese also spoke, saying looting, property damage and violence take away from our community's safety and our ability to move forward. ""The destruction in our community must stop,"" he said. ""I was personally there when our officers came under fire from projectiles, bottles and other items thrown at them. It was incredibly violent last night in front of the Justice Center at times."" He said police are actively looking for the people responsible for the damage at the Justice Center. Police have released photos of those suspects. Wheeler said the curfew will be in place Monday night and will be reassessed on a day-by-day basis.",0.0
1622597648,2020-06-01 14:19:17,"LA has seen racial uprisings, many not shocked by new round",https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/la-has-seen-racial-uprisings-many-not-shocked-by-new-round?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"LOS ANGELES (AP) "" When violent protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned down by a white Minneapolis officer, reached Los Angeles, people of color expressed heartbreak but not necessarily surprise "" they had seen it nearly 30 years ago during the Rodney King riots. On April 29, 1992, thousands in the city's largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking King, a black driver, after a traffic stop. The outcome outraged a community that watched video of King being beaten with police batons, shot with stun guns and stomped on. By the time order was restored, rioting had spread across much of LA for five days, leaving more than 60 people dead, over 2,300 injured and $1 billion in property damage. Smoke enveloped the city after hundreds of buildings burned to the ground. The losses are far higher than in protests over Floyd's killing that have swept the nation for days, devolving into people setting buildings and police cars on fire, smashing their way into stores and hurling rocks and bottles at officers. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and thousands of arrests, many of them in LA. Kerman Maddox was a young radio reporter who lived just a block from one of the flashpoints in the 1992 riots. 'I had a chance to see a lot and observe a lot, and I was hoping I would never see that again,' said Maddox, who is black. But he also thought he'd never see another video recorded by a bystander as violent as the one of King's beating, Maddox said. Not until he watched footage of white Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. 'I still have a hard time seeing that,"" said Maddox, who's a public affairs consultant. He said the chaotic protests it triggered did not entirely surprise him, soon after white men were arrested in May in the February killing of black Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery and other incidents. 'The problem is this is 2020, Rodney King happened almost 30 years ago and a lot of people see this stuff is still going on,"" Maddox said. ""You're upset, and you're angry, and you're perplexed because you're trying to figure out what do we have to do for this to end.' To see Los Angeles erupt in chaos for the second time in her life has been devastating, says Aurea Montes-Rodriguez, executive vice president of the Community Coalition South Los Angeles. As a high school student, she had to walk past burning buildings and looters after her school abruptly suspended bus service during the 1992 riots. The experience inspired her to dedicate her career to public service after earning a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. 'I felt that what I was seeing on TV the first night and when I walked through the fires the second day was a civil unrest by people who were fed up believing that the legal system, that the justice system, was going to work for our community,' she said on the 25th anniversary of the King riots in 2017. That's still the problem, she said Sunday, not only in Los Angeles but in other U.S. cities. 'I'm deeply concerned and heartbroken that this is happening in our city, and worse, that it's happening in different parts of the country because our elected officials refuse to hear or see the devastation that families are hearing and experiencing,' Montes-Rodriguez said. Civil rights scholar Jody Armour has noticed that people of color now protesting are often joined by white people, something he didn't see during the 1992 uprising. That could be an indication, he says, that more white people, realizing black people were not exaggerating when they spoke of the dangers of driving or walking while black, have begun to develop an empathy and to stand with African Americans against oppression. 'Racial discrimination today isn't the old KKK racism, but racism of indifference,' says Armour, a black University of Southern California professor who has written and lectured on racial justice, criminal justice and the rule of law. 'You're not motivated by racial animus or spite, you just don't feel the pain of the out-group members as you do for your in-group members."" Still, he cautioned real change has never been easy and is often violent, from the Civil War to the 1960s civil rights movement. That it has taken this long to get to that point is especially frustrating to Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who was 13 when the Watts riots erupted near her home in 1965 after white officers got into a scuffle with a drunken driving suspect in the city's racially segregated Watts neighborhood. More than 30 people were killed. While there were substantial efforts to rebuild communities after both uprisings, she said Sunday that it's clear that ""despite what we have done, what has still not changed is the systemic racism that we're seeing across the country as it relates to the interaction between law enforcement and unarmed black men.' She said she's encouraged that several police chiefs have spoken out against Floyd's death. In New Jersey, for instance, Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki joined protesters in a march. 'I think that's where it has to start, we have to reform throughout this country our police departments,"" said Hahn, who is white and whose late father, Kenneth Hahn, was a revered figure in the largely black community he represented on the county Board of Supervisors for 40 years. 'I'm 68 years old,"" she said ruefully. ""My hope is to see in my lifetime a real change. So that I don't go through one of these again.'",0.0
1622597641,2020-06-01 14:32:25,Facebook employees speak out against company over Trump,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/facebook-employees-speak-out-against-company-over-trump?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) "" Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. 'I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,' Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual 'walkout' to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers 'took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. 'I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,' tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 'likes' and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. 'I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,' Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's 'decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.' 'I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,' she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. 'We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback,' Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. 'We need to know George Floyd's name. But it's clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don't amplify bias,' Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag.",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

A scene from a Friday night vigil for George Floyd at Portland's Peninsula Park. Alex Zielinski Good morning Portland. It's been a long weekend for our small team over here at the Merc. I apologize in advance for any sleepy-eyed blunders in this morning's news roundup. It's been just under a week since Minneapolis police officers left George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, dying on the streets of his city. In the days since, every major city (and a bunch of minor ones) has shown their outrage over another Black man's death with massive protests, some leading to property destruction, looting, and arson. In many instances, armed police officers in riot gear have responded with violence, in the form of tear gas, explosive munitions, and seemingly unprovoked aggression.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has offered somewhat contradicting responses to the weekend's events, both condemning and acknowledging the intention behind destructive rallies. Yesterday afternoon, a group of Black Portland leaders joined him at a press conference to demand he continue to improve the inequitable and racist outcomes of his governing. Wheeler placed the City of Portland under a 8 pm curfew in the past few nights. That curfew will be reactivated tonight. In a morning press conference, US Attorney Billy Williams called for Gv. Brown to activate the National Guard. ""Everyone is doing their best, but we need bodies,"" said Williams. ""We need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence."" As an example, Williams points to protesters dispersing and spreading out over the city ""at some point during each protest.""

You can't tweet. You can't text. You got to get out here.”  He added, “When you’re here, and you see how people are hurting, you can understand what it is as opposed to being in your bedroom or your living room and saying, 'Hey, I don't like this.'”  Foxx promised the crowd he would continue to show up for whatever they needed.  “I don't preach or anything like that,” he said. “But I just want to be here to let you know that you got somebody that you can call anytime.”  He concluded by encouraging protesters to remain steadfast.  “Let's not forget that they may try to pull one on us,” he said. “Even now they say we didn't see what we saw.

After tense nights of civil unrest in neighboring Portland, Desiree Williams-Rajee and fellow members of the Beaverton Black Parent Union weren't sure what kind of crowd to expect at Southridge High School on Sunday afternoon, May 31. The Black Parent Union had sent out a message to families two nights earlier encouraging them to show up Sunday for a peaceful march to protest police brutality and systemic racism, after George Floyd died May 25 while a Minneapolis police officer pressed his neck into the ground with his knee. The officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, has since been fired from the police department and arrested on murder and manslaughter charges. Floyd, who was black, had been detained after allegedly giving a counterfeit $20 bill to a cashier. An independent autopsy found Floyd died of asphyxiation caused by pressure on his back and neck. Later Friday night, large-scale protests in Portland devolved into scenes of police lobbing tear gas, demonstrators smashing windows at Pioneer Place and the Multnomah County Justice Center, and graffiti and fires being set. Portland police declared a riot. The next day, organizers of the Black Family Unity Walk in Beaverton began asking attendees not to share the event on social media. Recognizing people's anxiety over everything from the coronavirus pandemic to the clashes between police and demonstrators in Portland, they also put together a list of safety precautions for their march. And on Sunday, until 4 p.m., they waited. 'It was really unbelievable' ""When you put something out, you don't really know,"" said Williams-Rajee, admitting her expectations for how many people would show up were low: ""We thought we might get, like, 70 or 80."" Instead, it was more than 500 people who marched from Southridge High School down to Southwest Scholls Ferry Road, along the state highway to Southwest Murray Boulevard, and then back again on the Tigard side. Demonstrators wore face masks, stayed out of car lanes and waited at crossing signals, doing what they could to practice social distancing and not obstruct traffic. Joe Fischer was returning from some errands to his home near Southridge High School when he drove past marchers gathering outside the school. ""Ironically, I fired off a Tweet shortly before that wondering 'what can I do?'"" Fischer said. ""That Tweeting and posting stuff only goes so far."" Fischer pulled over, got out of his car and walked with them. He took videos along the way with his smartphone and shared some footage on Twitter. ""It was really unbelievable,"" he said, marveling at the size of the crowd in his Beaverton neighborhood. ""It was something that I didn't think was ever going to happen."" The demonstration drew officials from the Beaverton School District, the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District, and others, including U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici and Beaverton mayoral candidate Lacey Beaty. ""As an elected official, I knew my role was to listen,"" said Beaty, who has been on the Beaverton City Council since 2014. Beaty and the other elected officials didn't have a speaking role at the march. Instead, she walked with marchers, having what she estimated was about two dozen conversations along the way. ""People are hurting. I heard, over and over, the word 'hurting' is what I heard. Not anger. … Not despair,"" Beaty said. She added, ""When the black community is hurting, our entire community is hurting."" Demographically, Beaverton is diversifying. More than one in every five city residents was born in another country, and people of color now comprise nearly 40% of the population. However, Beaverton's black population accounts for only about 2% of all residents. Williams-Rajee believes it is important for the local black community to organize and have representation. After thinking for years about ways to connect black families in Portland's Westside suburbs, she and other parents in the Beaverton School District formed the Black Parent Union in November, motivated by their desire to see money from the Student Success Act go toward equity programs and initiatives. ""I think in Beaverton, because there's no community-organizing organizations like there are in in Portland … our presence here has felt largely invisible,"" Williams-Rajee said, adding, ""For us as parents, our primary goal is to create an environment of safety and opportunity for our black students."" 'Number one, we live here' Williams-Rajee and Susan Elliott are Southridge parents. They said the administration at Southridge has been very supportive, and they were heartened to see Southridge school staff and others from the Beaverton School District and Jesuit High School at Sunday's demonstration. But they also said their families haven't always felt safe in Beaverton, a politically liberal suburb with a low crime rate. ""Simon was pulled over by a cop about three months ago,"" Elliott said of her son who graduated last year. ""She saw how scared he was and put her hand on her gun. He was shaking. She asked if he was reaching into his glove compartment to get his gun. He said no."" The police officer, Elliott said, told her son to ""calm down"" and let him go on his way. ""He's still traumatized,"" she said. ""Thank God nobody was shot."" Beaty said she had conversations with people at Sunday's march who told her stories about their interactions with law enforcement — some positive, and some negative. A U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq, Beaty said she's been thinking a lot since Floyd's death about her time in the military and the ""militarization"" of police departments across the United States. Many police forces are equipped with military surplus equipment or military-style gear, which have been on display during unrest in Portland and other major cities. ""We need to delineate those things,"" Beaty said. ""Rolling in with paramilitary, it really does send the wrong message."" Beaty said she wants to see stronger civilian oversight of law enforcement agencies. In Beaverton, she suggested, residents should be consulted on use-of-force policies and de-escalation techniques, and an independent team should be set up to respond to complaints against the police. It was important for Williams-Rajee and other organizers to be able to demonstrate in Beaverton, even if Portland has grabbed much of the attention in the region lately. ""Number one, we live here,"" she said. ""And that was really important that we were able to do a demonstration in the places where we live. … This was an opportunity to see each other being a community and be seen in Beaverton."" Passersby were largely supportive, Williams-Rajee said, describing Scholls Ferry Road as ""a honking mess"" as motorists sounded their horns in support of marchers. Neighbors cheered them on from their balconies or front yards or came out to join them. Fischer said one image that sticks in his mind is seeing a young girl on her front lawn, watching raptly. ""That little girl might remember this for the rest of her life, seeing this mass of people walking by,"" Fischer said. ""People are doing these kinds of things to make their presence felt and seen so that people in these residential neighborhoods, they can see that people not just in Portland, but Beaverton and some of these smaller suburbs, they feel the same way."" Beaverton and Tigard police were aware of organizers' plans. Officer Matt Henderson, spokesperson for the Beaverton Police Department, said there were no incidents with Sunday's march, and police weren't called upon to intervene. ""It was a picture-perfect example of people exercising their First Amendment right,"" Henderson said, adding, ""We would welcome more of that, as opposed to the other route."" While footage and images of violence and looting in Portland and other major cities left him feeling discouraged and worried, Fischer said Sunday's march in Beaverton made him hopeful. ""The more I think about it, and the more I see what I saw yesterday and what people are feeling,"" Fischer said, ""this is a very pivotal moment where the straw broke the camel's back, and the camel might not be able to get up again."" Williams-Rajee said after years working on race-related issues, she is seeing a difference today in how many people are approaching the topics of policing and systemic racism in government. ""I think there's a national conversation, I think there's local conversations, and then I think there's a hyperlocal conversation,"" she said, adding, ""What we would like to do is leverage this moment, because we're seeing unprecedented numbers of people who want to engage in conversation."" ""Clearly, we're at a breaking point in this country,"" Beaty said. ""I think we have the capacity to bring the right people to have meaningful change. We have to have meaningful change. This can't continue in the direction it's going."" She added, ""Yesterday was about grieving together, and today needs to be about change. And I think that's what the community is asking us to do.""

In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes on Monday night, when protesters are expected to gather again. But there are also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must 'have adequate force' and 'go after troublemakers.' 'Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,' Barr said. The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated "" 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation's capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, D.C., said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies 'confronting the lawless actions of rioters,' the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other 'anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the 'violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups' as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy called in the entire D.C. National Guard late Sunday, adding 1,200 soldiers to join about 500 forces that had already deployed in Washington, according to two Defense Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The soldiers will also be armed, the officials said, citing the potential threat from the protesters. Additional National Guard troops from nearby states were also being called in to help assist in Washington, officials said. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

1622686848,2020-06-01 16:28:30,"Floyd's brother pleads for peace, Trump takes combative tone",https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/floyds-brother-pleads-for-peace-trump-takes-combative-tone?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation's governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

(KOIN) — For a third consecutive day, clean-up crews filled the city to shore up damaged properties and remove broken glass and graffiti. It was an overwhelming task for some small business owners who were already hurting from the pandemic and are now facing uncertain futures. The streets of downtown Portland have evolved rapidly over the past weekend. It’s challenging to find a building in the city’s core that hasn’t sustained some type of damage. While brand name stores such as the Louis Vuitton store were broken into and looted, there were also small businesses caught in the wake of vandals. Many of those shops, which haven’t been open since the pandemic began, have since been boarded up. The one exception is the Bangkok Palace Thai restaurant on SW Taylor Street. Restaurant employees have cleaned up the inside and were doing their best to still take orders and serve customers on Monday. They said business was extremely slow, and they were worried about what the future holds for the restaurant. They were not alone on Monday. Volunteers were also out in the streets, helping the cleanup effort. One Portland man, known as Nobo, said he was doing what he could to help small businesses. “I figured I might as well clean up and then people can still get their message out and people don’t get as hurt,” Nobo said. ‘Message lost with violence, looting’ by protesters Picking up the pieces: Crews clean, board up stores after riot Power washers were humming through the morning on nearly every city block as crews did their best to remove tags and graffiti.",0.0

The protests in Portland have started with nonviolent vigils and rallies, with thousands gathering to honor Floyd and other black men and women killed by police officers nationwide and to call for a stop to police violence against people of color. During that time, Floyd said ""I can't breathe"" multiple times and repeatedly said ""Mama"" and ""please,"" as well. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly three minutes after officers discovered Floyd was non-responsive. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, allegedly kept his left knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pinned to the ground for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd was accused of using a $20 counterfeit bill and he died as police were taking him into custody. Protests began four days later. Portland has joined hundreds of cities across the country where unrest and riots have occurred in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in a Minneapolis police officer's custody. ""I cannot condone last night's violence,"" Wheeler said during a press conference Saturday morning. ""I can't stand by and watch our city be destroyed, buildings set aflame. I won't. But nor will I stand silent as men like George Floyd are murdered by the very institutions that are supposed to protect and serve them."" Police arrested 13 protesters and early Saturday morning, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency and enacted a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Demonstrators used electric scooters to smash police cars at Southwest 4th Avenue and Yamhill Street. Two officers were hurt. One was hit by an incendiary device and another was struck in the head with a rock. Both will be OK. Other protesters set fires throughout downtown, torching dumpsters, trash cans, cars and pallets. Police deemed the demonstration a riot and used tear gas, flash-bang grenades and other uses of force to disperse protesters. The march reached downtown, where demonstrators broke into and started a fire inside the Multnomah County Justice Center, home to hundreds of inmates. No inmates were injured. At around 10 p.m., a protester fired a shot at an occupied car on Northeast 7th Avenue and Morris Street. A person inside the car was grazed by a bullet and treated at a local hospital. The event turned quickly, however, as some demonstrators broke away from the group and started vandalizing businesses along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The rioters and looters shattered store windows and tagged buildings with graffiti that police say stretched for 20 blocks. At around 9 p.m., the group of protesters started to march down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard while chanting, ""black lives matter,"" ""no justice, no peace,"" and ""I can't breathe."" ""We stand with the grieving family of George,"" said Rev. Roy Tate of Christ Memorial Community Church while addressing the crowd. ""Those who are in Minneapolis, we stand tonight with them."" The vigil was organized by activist group PNW Youth Liberation Front. Hundreds of people, spread out across the park, showed up to honor Floyd and listen to speakers. It started Friday afternoon with a peaceful gathering organized by the NAACP and then a vigil in the evening at North Portland's Peninsula Park. ""You're not just burning and destroying someone else's home. You're burning your community, too,"" Wheeler said. On Sunday morning, Wheeler extended the citywide curfew another day and said that ""rioters and looters"" were co-opting the protests . He said the rioters' actions didn't feel like sincere mourning for Floyd. Saturday's protest was less crowded and destructive than Friday. As of 10 p.m., only small groups remained downtown and by 2 a.m., police tweeted the protests had started to die down. A total of 48 adults were arrested during Saturday's demonstrations. Protesters threw fireworks at the Multnomah County Courthouse, projectiles at officers and assaulted an officer. Hundreds of protesters attended the initial demonstration but quickly disbursed into smaller groups as SWAT officers spread throughout the city in an effort to quell rioting and violence. By 7:15 p.m., police had declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch declared the gathering a civil disturbance at 8:30 p.m. ""This is heartbreaking,"" said Vanessa Sturgeon, chair of the Portland Business Alliance board of directors. ""These businesses were already hurting because of the COVID-19 crisis. This is just another blow. This is one of the saddest moments in our city's history."" Volunteers with groups like Central City Concern and Portland Patrol, Inc. showed up Saturday to help remove graffiti, sweep up broken glass and help store owners repair damaged storefronts. Portland business leaders thanked the volunteers and said the destruction they witnessed was devastating. ""Yesterday thousands of Oregonians mourned and spoke out for justice together. But late last night small groups decided to smash windows and light fires. Senseless violence does not honor George Floyd’s death or create accountability. Only the hard work of racial justice will,"" said Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. Leading up to Saturday's night of protests, state and city leaders spoke about the importance of standing up for change and committing to racial justice while also condemning the acts of violence and destruction from the previous night's protests. On Monday morning, Wheeler extended the curfew another day and called on Gov. Brown to deploy the National Guard, which the governor did Monday afternoon. Police used flash bangs and tear gas to disperse protesters. The group splintered into smaller groups and there were reports of vandalism and people setting fires through the early morning hours of Monday. The conversation was cut short though, because around 11:30 p.m., police said some protesters were setting off fireworks and ""aerial morters"" at officers. Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly a short time later. One of the community members, Michael Richardson, said racial injustice isn't isolated to George Floyd in Minneapolis but has been a widespread problem for generations across the country. Resch called the meeting a ""very good conversation."" For hours, the demonstration remained peaceful. A group of three community members and protesters met with Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch during the demonstration. As the crowd marched to downtown, police announced over loud speakers that they would protect the demonstrators' First Amendment rights if they remained peaceful. ""The actions of this group will set the tone for this evening. Do not destroy your city,"" police announced. The group first marched to a former police precinct building on Southeast 47th Avenue and Burnside and then peacefully marched several miles westbound, crossed the Burnside Bridge and entered downtown Portland. They reached the justice center around 9:30 p.m. The main protest, with thousands of people in attendance, started at around 6 p.m. at Laurelhurst Park in Southeast Portland. A smaller protest group gathered at the Multnomah County Justice Center early Sunday night. Police quickly declared that gathering an unlawful assembly and dispersed the group. Portland police said protesters were throwing water bottles at officers. Before the protests got underway, Portland police asked the Oregon Department of Transportation to shut down freeway off-ramps leading into downtown Portland. During an appearance on MSNBC, Wheeler said they made the unusual request because they'd received intel that some demonstrators were coming from outside the city. Small groups of protesters gathered in downtown Portland Sunday afternoon, and one passerby captured an inspiring moment on camera , as Portland police officers took a knee with protesters. Sunday's protest was larger than the protests the previous two nights and remained peaceful for hours. Chapter four : Monday, June 1 A group of thousands of demonstrators in Portland peacefully protested the killing of George Floyd, the Minnesota black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, for hours on Monday night. After they disbanded on their own accord for the night, a clash between police and a separate, smaller group of about 100 protesters took place in the early hours of Tuesday morning around Southwest 4th Avenue and Salmon Street. The Portland Police Bureau said that clash, which lasted until about 1 a.m., involved protesters throwing projectiles, including glass bottles and rocks, at officers in downtown, prompting police to declare an unlawful assembly. One officer suffered minor injuries when they were hit by an object. Police said they used crowd control munitions to disperse the small group. Police tried to stop a woman who was driving through the streets handing out items to protesters but she fled, hitting several cars in the process. The woman was arrested after officers deployed spike strips to stop the driver near Southeast 14th Avenue and Franklin Street. One officer was injured during this incident. More than a dozen protesters were arrested into Tuesday morning and two firearms were seized. ""Thousands of demonstrators participated in an extensive march without engaging in violence or destructive behavior,"" said Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch. ""Thank you for keeping this event peaceful. Your efforts to police the event yourselves created a safer environment for all. ""We will continue to arrest and hold responsible those who engage in acts of violence directed at the police, community members, or who commit other criminal acts,"" Resch said. While Monday night may have ended with that clash, the main protest group of the night remained peaceful during its hours-long demonstration. That group started the night on Portland’s east side, marched across the bridge into downtown Portland, gathered outside the Multnomah County Justice Center and then packed into Pioneer Courthouse Square before heading back to the east side where they disbanded near Revolution Hall at around 11:30 p.m.",0.0

(KOIN) — The 4th consecutive night of protests spurred by the death of George Floyd brought what may have been the largest crowd to downtown Portland, filling Pioneer Courthouse Square and surrounding streets. Earlier in the day the protesters were fanned out in the Northeast and Southeast quadrants as well as in the downtown area. But after the curfew began at 8 p.m., the groups coalesced downtown. Thousands of protesters gather in Pioneer Square on Monday night. June 1, 2020 (KOIN) Organizers did their best to maintain a peaceful atmosphere and their efforts worked. PPB tweeted: “We have not witnessed any vandalism or destruction. This has been an hours’ long protest that has remained peaceful. Thank you and we see you and hear you!” Shortly after 10 p.m. the crowd left Pioneer Courthouse Square and began marching across the Burnside Bridge again. At 11 p.m. organizers said they were ending the rally at SE 13th and Stark. Anything that may happen after that is not connected with this rally, they said. ‘We want peace, fighting for freedom’ Carlos Newell of Portland said the thousands who gathered at Pioneer Courthouse Square was “beautiful. We got black, white, every color. We’re just out here having a peaceful protest, spreading love. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life.” He said he wasn’t at the earlier protests — “I know there was little riots and stuff like that going on” — but said this crowd showed what they’re fighting for: Unity and peace. “We’re not all out here trying to cause a ruckus,” Newell said. “We want justice. We want peace. We’re fighting for freedom.” Earlier in the night Around 7:30 p.m. — a half-hour from the Portland 8 p.m. curfew — thousands of protesters crossed the Burnside Bridge into downtown. As they crossed, they held a “die in” for 9 minutes — the length of time George Floyd was kneeled on by a Minneapolis officer. It was the second time in hours that protesters crossed one of the Portland bridges, as protesters crossed the Morrison Bridge earlier. When the Burnside group got across, they merged with another group from Stark and 16th. The combined protesters then fanned out throughout the downtown Portland area. Protesters march across the Burnside Bridge. Monday, June 1, 2020 (KOIN) The crowds to this point remained peaceful, chanting “George Floyd,” “No Justice, No Peace,” Whose street? Our street!” and “Let us through” as they marched along the sidewalks. Around 8:15 p.m. police used their loudspeakers to tell the protesters not to interfere with the fencing that cordoned off a section of the core city. “If you tamper with the fencing or interfere with officer instructions you will be subject to uses of force. Stay back from the fencing.” Photos: Portland protests, June 1, 2020 The crowd at SW 4th and Salmon became agitated and asked to talk with someone from the police. “We have heard your request,” a police officer said over the loudspeaker. “We have someone coming to talk with you now.” The crowd cheered. A liaison officer came to the fencing, spoke to the crowd and tensions eased. After about 20 minutes in one location the protesters began to move again. A PPB liasion officer answered questions and addressed a crowd of protesters in downtown Portland, June 1, 2020 (KOIN) Section of downtown blocked off Blockades were addressed on Twitter, where Portland police said, “Areas of downtown Portland are now closed. You must leave the closed areas now. You may practice your First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly in a peaceful manner at places outside of the closed locations.” Map of Portland police road closures in downtown. June 1, 2020 (KOIN) Demonstrators gathered in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center, which has become a frequent site in Portland’s ongoing protests against police brutality. Around 2:30 p.m. hundreds of people began moving north through the city, marching in the street, united with chants that called for justice for George Floyd, the unarmed, handcuffed Black man who died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on Monday, May 25. After marching several blocks, the protesters were met with a line of Portland police officers who stood in the street, blocking their path. The crowd met police with chants of “You’re on the wrong side,” and “No justice, no peace.” En masse, they took a knee in front of the police. The peaceful protesters turned around and gathered in Pioneer Square where community organizer Lyfe Tavarres led demonstrators in a moment of silence for not only George Floyd, but Breonna Taylor and other Black lives lost to police violence. Protesters gather at Washington High School in SE Portland for the 4th night of George Floyd protests, June 1, 2020 (KOIN) Shortly after 5 p.m. marchers headed across the Morrison Bridge. After crossing the bridge, protesters doubled back and headed back into downtown. Around that same time, another group of protesters gathered at the Washington High School campus on SE Stark. Again, the protesters were peaceful, chanting slogans and waving signs. A demonstration to honor George Floyd, originally slated as peaceful and kid-friendly, drew a larger than expected crowd to Northeast Portland Monday afternoon. The 4 p.m. event took place at the five corners of NE Sandy and 57th as hundreds of sign-carrying people lined the sidewalks. In an early Monday morning press conference, Portland Police Chief Jami Resch said the bureau estimated more than 6,000 people attended Sunday’s demonstration, making it the largest protest the city had seen that week.",0.0

Solidarity vigils for black people killed by police and protests against police violence that spread throughout the nation over the weekend have spilled into the usually quiet suburbs south of Portland. Students from West Linn High School spent Sunday, May 31 and Monday, June 1 next to a small shrine for George Floyd — a black man killed by Minneapolis police one week ago — at the 10th Street on-ramp to I-205, bearing ""Black Lives Matter"" signs. Matilda Milner, a junior at WLHS, along with her friend Maddie Selby, organized the protests, which saw around 50 people join on Sunday. ""We know that West Linn is a town with a history of a very racist police department. Oregon is a state that was founded on white supremacy. It was founded to be a whites-only state,"" Milner said. ""We think that any kind of activism or organization advocating for people of color in Oregon is especially important."" WLPD has come under intense scrutiny over the past several months for the unlawful and racially-motivated arrest of a black man from Portland in 2017. Earlier that year, Tom Newberry, a West Linn officer, was fired for encouraging violence against Black Lives Matter activists and other racist social media posts. Milner said she hopes this week's protest ensures people stay focused on this issue, noting the fast pace of today's newscycle. ""We're hoping that people who pass us by remember that police brutality is a real and prevalent issue in America and right here in West Linn, Oregon,"" Milner said. Amanda Whittington, a WLHS junior, was at the protest all Sunday and again Monday. ""We need to keep coming out here to do what's right,"" Whittington said. ""We can't have just one day where we're fighting for this and then all the other days we just forget about it. We need to keep making change. We can't just wait around for people to die."" Sydney Robertson, a graduating senior, joined the group Monday in support of friends who were unable to come because of COVID-19. ""I want people to know that they're not alone if they feel like they're in West Linn and they're alone, (that) they don't have other people fighting for them— there are,"" Whittington said. Kenna Gubler, another student protester, said she was there because she wants people of color to be able to live their lives without fear. Milner said, for the most part, passersby were supportive, waving or honking in solidarity, though a few have been less pleased with their protest. ""There has been a little bit of heckling, a little bit of 'Go home,' or 'All lives matter,' or people flipping us off,"" Milner said. Milner said, so far, the students protesting have had no interactions with police. Whittington said that it's important for her to be a part of this movement in a peaceful way, though she understands where all the anger is coming from.",0.0

The large crowds of protestors and sizeable police response left swaths of downtown Portland inaccessible to transit trains and buses. In the midst of unpredictable protest patterns and a heavy police response, TriMet riders have been left with little warning regarding when service will be delayed or suspended, and which areas are safe to travel through. All five MAX lines and many TriMet bus routes run through downtown Portland, meaning service has been impacted throughout the region. “The past several days and nights, we have had to adjust service for the safety of our riders, operators, and equipment,” TriMet spokesperson Roberta Altstadt wrote in an email to the Mercury. “Altering train and bus service also is for the safety of the demonstrators and law enforcement who may find themselves in the streets we travel… Adjusting service has been done quickly, with little warning. That is for the safety of everyone, and following the guidance of police.” On Friday night—the first night of peaceful protests that turned into looting, property damage, and a forceful police response as the night went on—TriMet vehicles traveling through the downtown core experienced severe delays. Though Mayor Ted Wheeler declared an 8 pm curfew on Saturday night, TriMet provided service for essential workers exempt from the curfew. But as the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) used pepper balls and flashbang stun grenades to disperse crowds downtown, TriMet suspended downtown service starting at 7:30 pm. On Sunday afternoon and night, crowds of thousands marched on East Burnside and protested in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center downtown, despite an extension of Wheeler’s curfew. TriMet ceased its downtown service at 3:30 pm Sunday on PPB’s advice. The transit agency plans to stop downtown service again at 8 pm on Monday evening, as Wheeler’s curfew is extended another night and more protests are expected. “TriMet asks riders to keep a close eye on news reports and any developing demonstrations that could impact service,” reads a Monday afternoon media release from TriMet. Riders can also check TriMet’s Twitter and website, and sign up for email alerts. In addition to disrupting service, the protests have taken their toll on TriMet buses, trains, and other infrastructure. “Unfortunately, we’ve sustained quite a bit of vandalism to bus stops and MAX stations in Downtown Portland and the Lloyd neighborhood,” Altstadt wrote to the Mercury. “Along with graffiti, we’ve had shelters, benches, and information displays destroyed, that are meant to help our riders when using the transit system. Some trains and buses have been vandalized as well and we’ve had to remove them from service, causing further delays for riders.” “While we understand emotions are high, we would ask that people don’t vandalize our vehicles, stops, and stations,” she added. “It impacts our efforts to provide transit service to those who rely on it.”",0.0

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

Wm. Steven Humphrey Hey good friends, Last night was Sunday, May 31, and I along with a couple thousand others were out on the street in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center. I was covering the rally to remember George Floyd and end police brutality, because a) sure, that’s my job, b) our small staff is severely overworked, and c) I’m in the give-a-crap club. I’ve adored Portland from the moment I arrived, and while our current hellscape seems to be inexplicably getting even worse, being out there with you last night reminded me how much I adore you. Look, I know how the media can misrepresent protests—and while the Mercury tries to avoid it, even we fall into time-worn traps of focusing on the result of destruction (broken windows, looting) rather than the cause (economic and racial disparity, an unnecessarily-militarized police force). So I want to take a moment to describe something I saw last night that doesn’t fall into that narrative. It was around 11:30 pm, and I (and at least a thousand more) had been gassed, flash-banged, and chased around the downtown corridor for hours. We had returned to the Justice Center, and the crowd was overwhelmingly polite. In fact, every single time I saw someone act out—trying to distribute fireworks, toss water bottles at cops—they were immediately shut down by fellow protesters. In any case, late in the evening something happened that made the cops nervous, and once again flash bangs flew, and tear gas filled the air. The majority of the crowd was forced back into the downtown area, though one small group didn’t move. They were nose-to-nose with a line of riot cops on the south side of the building, just out of distance from the gas. I didn’t run, because they didn’t. I really didn’t expect what I saw—a line of protesters calmly talking to the cops and each other. “We are peaceful.” “Remember the name of George Floyd.” “It’s okay—you don’t need those riot suits.” “We’re here to honor and protect people of color.” When new people wandered up, they were immediately told that this space was peaceful—this tiny oasis of calm as gas hovered in the air, and police sirens blared—and anyone who intended to cause trouble was not welcome. And for the first time all evening, I felt safe. Even while I was six feet away from a riot cop’s baton. That's when a cop car suddenly sped by, loudspeaker blaring. “This is an unlawful demonstration….” Our heads jerked around and suddenly the tension ratcheted up tenfold. Looking at the faces of these unarmed protesters who were mere inches away from a line of police dressed in military gear, I was reminded that for too many people in this nation, the feeling of safety—that I as a white person take for granted—is an illusion. And yet these words pulled us back in. “We are de-escalating.” “We are peaceful.” “George Floyd.” “Breonna Taylor.” “Ahmaud Arbery.” ""We're united."" It was reverential. It was certainly as close to being in church as I can remember, even as it felt like the world around us was crumbling. There were a lot of scenes like this last night—of people passing out water, picking up trash, offering emotional support, helping wash tear gas out of the eyes of a Mercury reporter. These are important stories to share, and to do that, we need eyes on the street and especially your support. Due to the COVID pandemic, we were forced to lay off the majority of our staff, including editorial members that we adore and who would’ve happily helped us cover the protests over the past few days. Currently we have the staff that we can afford, and to be honest, after working nearly 30 hours over the past weekend alone, we’re tired. Tired, but undaunted, because that’s our job: We want you to see what we see. You can help keep our eyes and hearts on the street, and hopefully allow us to get more help in the future, by making monthly donations to the Mercury if you are able. We certainly appreciate all the help you’ve given us thus far, and trust me when I say not a penny has gone to waste. Please take care of yourselves—especially now—and if you can, join those who practice de-escalation and the protection of those who need it most. We’ll be looking out for you, too. Yer always pal, Wm. Steven Humphrey Editor-in-Chief Portland Mercury",0.0

Police shut down roads and fired tear gas on the group twice. The night’s actions followed a day of lawful protest where thousands of people flooded Eugene’s streets to support the Black Lives Matter movement. ""We had a largely lawful protest earlier today, where organizers worked to provide a safe framework for their free speech,"" said Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner in a Monday news release. ""Later, there was a group that appeared to have a different set of goals. ""These protesters we have been seeing as daylight falls appear to be younger and excited about creating conflict,"" he said. ""This comes at a cost to the community. Our local businesses and residents can’t afford and don’t deserve to have to pay for what occurs when mobs get out of control."" The conflict started at about 8 p.m. when a group of protesters gathered at Broadway and Olive Street, according to the news release. The group grew to about 50 people with some sitting in the street and some hitting light poles with hammers to make noise. The majority of people left after police told them to disperse, but some stayed. Police deployed tear gas at about 8:20 p.m. at 10th Avenue and Willamette Street. One person was arrested at this point in the night. A crowd then later formed at Kesey Square and three people were breaking mailboxes. Four were arrested at this point. Protesters continued to gather at East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street, so police shut down the Ferry Street Bridge. The city of Eugene also extended its temporary curfew to apply citywide at 11 p.m., which was announced via a press release at 10:59 p.m. ""Multiple people"" were arrested for acting as aggressors, according to the release. Police told people to disperse and deployed more gas at Kincaid Street and East 14th Avenue around 11:11 p.m. A video of the event captured by The Register-Guard shows police firing a gas canister directly at Henry Houston, a Eugene Weekly reporter, standing alone in the parking lot. EPD released a list of those arrested during the Sunday night protest. They were between the ages of 20 and 47, and the majority were arrested for curfew order violations. Four additional people were arrested on Saturday. Six of those arrested Sunday had Eugene addresses, one was from Springfield and the other four were listed as ""city unknown"" or ""no address."" The four arrested Saturday were from Eugene and Springfield. Skinner said a lot of people traveled to Eugene to participate in Sunday’s events. ""We’ve seen people travel into Eugene to take advantage of certain aspects of the demonstration or protesting, both for the right reasons and wrong reasons, unfortunately,"" he said. Eugene saw its first incident of the weekend Friday night when what began as a Black Lives Matter protest devolved into a massive bonfire in the street and looting of restaurants and businesses on West Seventh Avenue. But as with Sunday’s protests, Skinner said the instigators of the destruction were not connected to the peaceful protests earlier, and it was unclear whether the Friday provocateurs were affiliated with a group. ""There was no indication that it was organized Antifa or anarchists that were behind that,"" Skinner said. ""The instigators we had on Friday night were largely white young men and women. So I think unfortunately people have a tendency to want to lump this into a Black Lives Matter movement that is responsible for some of this violence and we’re just not seeing that at all. Our communities of color have been loud and proud and they’ve also been very respectful and lawful in the way they’ve been communicating."" Skinner said several agencies assisted this weekend, including Springfield Police Department, Eugene Springfield Fire Department and Lane County Sheriff’s Office. Many Eugene police officers were called in on their normal days off or to work overtime, and even those typically in the field less often, such as detectives, were pulled in to assist with control.",0.0

Treven Upkes addresses a crowd of about 500 protesters at the barricades on Liberty St. a block from the new police headquarters. Salem Statesman Journal A crowd of hundreds knelt in silence on the lawn of the Capitol Mall in Monday evening’s twilight. The two previous nights saw protests at the State Capitol turn into riots in downtown Salem, and the Salem Police Department responded by firing tear gas into mobs and arresting citizens. But on Monday, two uniformed Salem Police Department officers slowly made their way from the back of the crowd and up the park to the front where they surveyed the those assembled. Then, they both knelt with everyone else. The dramatic gesture made an impression on the protesters, and Salem Police Lt. Treven Upkes and Lt. Jason VanMeter exchanged handshakes and hugs with members of the audience. Upkes read a letter from the City of Salem, Salem-Keizer NAACP and the Salem Police Department supporting the crowd's right to peaceful assembly, acknowledging their concerns and that the community still has work to do to stop injustices. He then answered questions from many of the protesters. After the tensions rapidly escalated the prior nights, the gesture of the Salem Police Department was met with a round of applause from the crowd, and Monday’s protest remained peaceful. “It was a small step, but yet again a huge step at the same time,” said Juan Trevino III, a protester from Salem. “Ultimately this is showing that they are wanting to work with us, and as long as we give them the same respect to work with them, then we can pursue a better relationship with them and end the riots here in Salem, end the chaos and the violence. “And that’s ultimately the goal to end them everywhere in the nation when they get an agreement with their officers that they are wanting to bring peace.” Buy Photo Demonstrators march during a peaceful rally and march in Salem, Oregon on Monday, June 1, 2020. People gathered to protest the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police officers. (Photo: BRIAN HAYES / STATESMAN JOURNAL) In the days that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department, protests erupted around the United States, including riots in Salem that led to graffiti at the State Capitol, buildings damaged in downtown and police being targeted by protesters. Most of those who participated in the vigil and protest left the area at the event. A small group of people did not comply with the city-issued curfew and gathered near Winter and Chemeketa streets. ""Those individuals began throwing projectiles, explosive devices, water and other objects at the officers,"" Salem police spokeswoman Lt. Debbie Aguilar said Monday. Seven people were arrested and taken into custody. No injuries of participants or officers were reported. No additional property damage was reported. Off those arrested, many were in their late teens. Upkes said the Salem Police Department normally works with those who want to hold organized protests and admitted it was caught off guard by the protests and riots on Saturday and Sunday. Monday’s gesture by the officers went a long way in reaching out to the community. “Tonight looked like it was the first opportunity for us to do that,” Upkes said. “Last night, really, there didn’t seem to be someone or a group of people we could actually have a dialogue with. “This is a touchstone and a momentous time in history, and we’re going to try to be a part of that, and we got to fix the issues that people are upset about.” Until the dramatic entrance by the officers, the Salem Police Department and Oregon State Police went out of their way to not let their presence be felt, except when a passing Salem Police Department officer waved as he passed the crowd. Protesters started gathering at the State Capitol around 5 p.m. and chanted sayings like, “Say his name. George Floyd,” and “Black Lives Matter.” The group, which grew to around 200 by 7:30 p.m., started a march through city streets downtown, winding its way back to the Capitol Mall.

(Photo: BRIAN HAYES / STATESMAN JOURNAL) After that, officers from the Salem Police Department and Oregon State Police blocked off roads and watched as the protest remained peaceful and people took turns addressing the crowd on a megaphone. Salem was placed under a curfew of 8 p.m. Monday by City Manager Steve Powers, but it wasn’t enforced on those at the Capitol, even when the crowd that had grown to about 500 marched again to the site of the new Salem Police Department on Division Street by candlelight. “If they want to stand on the Capitol steps, it’s up to Oregon State Police to make a determination, but I’m pretty sure there’s not a lot of trespassing that takes place on the people’s property,” Upkes said. “If we can talk to people that are level headed and want to take a trip through downtown, we can help provide that. It’s when we veer outside that peaceful that we got to evaluate the situation.” Many in the crowd left their candles burning at the construction barricades on Liberty Street where they again chanted and talked with police.

What seemed to ultimately change the course of the protest was the communication by the police with the protesters rather than against them as they had the previous nights. “Ultimately what had happened in Minneapolis is due to police brutality, a police officer going over with excessive force and causing his death,” said Trevino, who started a WalkWithUs Movement group on Facebook to work with the police in the protests. “And that’s ultimately the core problem and what we need to do is come together with our police and say, we don’t have this issue here in Salem, so our police office should not have a problem committing to say, hey, we’re going to go ahead and make a stand ... that we can end that.” bpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com or Twitter.com/bpoehler Buy Photo Alexis Christensen hugs Lieutenant Treven Upkes during a peaceful rally and march in Salem, Oregon on Monday, June 1, 2020.

(Photo: BRIAN HAYES / STATESMAN JOURNAL) UPDATE 11:02 p.m. The protest largely broke up by 11 p.m. with a few remaining people taking part in a candlelight vigil on the steps in front of the State Capitol. There were only minor skirmishes throughout the night, unlike the protests Saturday and Sunday nights when police fired tear gas into crowds. Organizers called for people in the crowd to come back together at 8 p.m. Tuesday for another peaceful protest. UPDATE 9:42 p.m. Marchers have reached the new police headquarters. Along the way, they stopped at the intersection of Liberty and Marion streets and took a knee. They are about a block away from the actual new police headquarters building, blocked by a construction barricades. UPDATE 9:10 p.m. Salem police have blocked Court Street from auto traffic in front of the Capitol. The number of demonstrators has grown to about 500. Lt. Treven Upkes said the 8 p.m. curfew won't be enforced on those who are part of the protest in front of the Capitol. Protesters have started marching toward the new police headquarters, still under construction at Division and Commercial streets. Police are closing streets as marchers make progress. UPDATE 8:45 p.m. After two nights of protests ended in tear gas and arrests, the Salem Police Department made a dramatic statement Monday night on the steps of the Oregon Capitol. A crowd of demonstrators had swelled to more than 200 people by the time it left the Capitol and marched through downtown, blocking some streets before winding back to the Capitol Mall. Many then took a knee despite the sprinklers spraying many of them. With the crowd silent, Salem Police Lt. Treven Upkes and Lt. Jason VanMeter walked to the front of the crowd and took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Upkes and VanMeter then read a letter to the crowd and talked with demonstrators at length. “Tonight looked like it was the first opportunity for us to do that,” Upkes said. “Last night, really, there didn’t seem to be someone or a group of people we could actually have a dialogue with. Quite honestly, Saturday night we were caught a little off guard. “This is a touchstone and a momentous time in history, and we’re going to try to be a part of that, and we got to fix the issues that people are upset about.” Joint Statement by Statesman Journal on Scribd UPDATE 7:30 p.m. The crowd at the State Capitol has grown to about 150. Many enthusiastic motorists are honking their horns and waving to the crowd as they pass by. At about 7:30 p.m., the crowd started marching east of the Capitol on Court Street. UPDATE: 6:15 p.m. About 50 people gathered in front of the State Capitol by the start of Monday’s 6 p.m. planned third consecutive day of protests over the death of George Floyd.

Please consider donating to the Mercury to keep it comin'!) • This afternoon, Gov. Kate Brown gave a press conference announcing that she'll be deploying 50 National Guard troops and 100 State Troopers to Portland to assist local police in ""managing"" tonight's protest—even though I'm pretty sure that an even bigger force of militarized police will only succeed in downtown seeing twice as many protesters. However, according to Brown, the National Guard will only be there to process arrests, and will not be armed.  Every Dem mayor right now is like ""we thank you for your peaceful protests, we've heard you, we are doing nothing to fix any of these problems, your curfew is 2 minutes from now and I've given the cops brand new aerodynamic beating sticks"" — E-Town Concrete Milkshake (@lightfantastic) June 1, 2020 • This weekend, Portland saw three nights of varied protests, including a peaceful vigil in North Portland, a frenzy of broken windows, theft, burning banks, tear gas downtown, and a large march of chanting demonstrators winding through Portland's Eastside. Here's the Mercury's live, on-the-ground coverage from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Last night 12 people were arrested, and you can surely expect more tonight. In fact, it has already started. • Meanwhile, a Gresham police officer shot and killed a man in Southeast Portland yesterday evening. The exact details of the shooting have yet to come out — but we're paying attention. • Also during this crazy weekend, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown fired the head of the Oregon Employment Department for the agency's shockingly slow ability to deliver unemployment benefits—even months after jobless Oregonians have filed claims. IN NATIONAL NEWS: • Our idiot president, who spent at least some of his weekend hidden in a bunker under a darkened White House, started his Monday by calling Russian president Vladimir Putin before getting on a conference call with state governors to berate them for being ""weak,"" suggesting they ask for the ""wonderful military"" to assist in subjugating American citizens. The specific word he (repeatedly) used was ""dominate,"" in fact. This afternoon, he threatened the same governors of these states, saying if they don't send out the National Guard to quell protesters (who he calls ""domestic terrorists""), he would send in the military to do their job for them. • Related: This is where we'd link to any news outlet's running tally of the Governors, Senators, and Representatives officially asking the president to tender his resignation in response to this behavior, but that link doesn't exist because there are currently no Governors, Senators, or Representatives doing so. • It's been just under a week since Minneapolis police officers left George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, dying on the streets of his city. In the days since, every major city (and a bunch of minor ones) has shown their outrage over another Black man's death with massive protests, some leading to property destruction, looting, and arson. In many instances, armed police officers in riot gear have responded with violence, in the form of tear gas, explosive munitions, and seemingly unprovoked aggression. • Many of the police targets have been journalists. Over the weekend, a Minneapolis photojournalist lost her eye after police shot her in the face with a rubber bullet and dozens of others were directly tear gassed after identifying themselves as the media. That includes Eugene Weekly reporter Henry Houston.  My favorite part was watching the police officers inside their tank laugh as I screamed I’m a journalist. — Henry Houston (@hwhouston1) June 1, 2020 • An independent autopsy of George Floyd, commissioned by the Floyd family, concluded his cause of death was ""Homicide by Asphyxia,"" due to Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into his neck for almost 10 straight minutes. This conclusion contradicts the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office autopsy, which claimed he died from ""underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system."" • Chauvin's first court appearance, to face his third-degree murder and manslaughter charges, is scheduled for June 8. • You love to see it:  Confederate monuments across the South were vandalized during George Floyd demonstrations https://t.co/pf4rXsJMvj — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) May 31, 2020 • Emboldened by our idiot president's Twitter-declared intent to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization (despite the fact Antifa isn't an organization, and even if it were, making protests against fascism a criminal act is blatantly unconstitutional), Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton took to his Twitter and advocated deploying the 101st Airborne, the 10th Mountain, the 82nd Airborne, the 1st Cav, and the 3rd Infantry to attack protesters. • Meanwhile, at Facebook: Dozens of employees have ""walked out"" of their jobs for the day in response to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public statements criticizing Twitter for doing the barest of bare minimums to fact-check our idiot president last week.

And also like many cities, those protests didn’t always stay peaceful. In a conversation on OPB’s “Think Out Loud” Monday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty discussed the challenges of managing heated protest in Oregon’s largest city. Wheeler said he has had at least three conversations over the weekend with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, asking her to consider mobilizing the National Guard. Wheeler said that he’s not proposing for the militarization of Portland, but that National Guard troops would be on reserve. “They will not be used unless absolutely necessary, but we just don’t have the police resources available…night after night to maintain the public’s safety,” Wheeler said. Under pressure from Wheeler and U.S. Attorney Billy Williams early Monday, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced later Monday that 50 Oregon National Guard members and 100 state troopers are heading to Portland as the city braces for a fourth night of protests. Brown said the National Guard would not be on the streets or making arrests. The soldiers will only be acting as support for the city of Portland police and the Oregon State Police troopers. It’ll be the fourth night in a row of an official curfew, beginning at 8 p.m. Monday night through 6 a.m. on Tuesday, though both Wheeler and Hardesty acknowledged curfew is not maintaining order. “I actually think we should be backing off on the curfew because clearly the case is having the opposite impact we’re wanting to have,” Hardesty said. Wheeler said the curfew gave police flexibility, and that there were “legal reasons” to call for it. “The curfew will not be enforced as long as things remain peaceful,” Wheeler said. “I think tomorrow we should actually reevaluate if it even makes sense to call for a curfew.” Community organizer Lilith Sinclair with the Activism, Actually platform, emphasized that the protesters are pushing for action, not just a discussion. “I think that Ted Wheeler is right, we don’t want dialogues…instead we want actions and results,” Sinclair said. As an indication of the frustration many activists are feeling, Sinclair suggested “white privileged men” like Wheeler are part of the problem — and should be removed. “I personally think that a great action step for Ted Wheeler would be to resign, in recognition of the fact that as a privileged, white, millionaire man that has a lot of learning to do,” Sinclair said. “Not only about what it means to take action on the demilitarization and defunding of the police, but also about the day to day lives and experiences of working-class people of all abilities and races that he can’t really connect to.”",0.0

He never thought he'd get a chance to fight back, let alone make it out alive. But on Monday, Soltan, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen now living in Virginia, used a federal statute to accuse former Egyptian prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi of crimes against humanity. The 1991 Torture Victims Protection Act allows for victims of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by foreign officials abroad to seek justice through the American court system. It's the first such case against an Egyptian official, made possible by the grim coincidence that el-Beblawi now lives just miles from Soltan, in Washington, where he is an executive director of the International Monetary Fund. 'He's completely gotten away with it, and is walking free downtown,' Soltan said. 'I just want to regain some of the justice and dignity stripped away from me.' El-Beblawi, contacted through the IMF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the summer of 2013, after the military-led ouster of the country's first democratically elected but divisive president, Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian security officers descended on a protest camp packed with his Islamist supporters, killing hundreds. Soltan, an Ohio State graduate and the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was shot in the arm while working as a stringer for Western news organizations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Before long he was picked up by security forces. In a mass trial widely condemned by human rights groups, Soltan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of spreading 'fake news"" to tarnish Egypt's image. In the maximum-security Tora prison complex, Soltan says he endured unspeakable torments overseen by el-Beblawi and other high-ranking officers. He says he was denied medical care for his festering bullet wound, beaten to unconsciousness, held in solitary confinement and forced to listen to the sounds of his father being tortured in a nearby cell. He lost 160 pounds over the course of a 16-month hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. Under pressure from the Obama administration, Egypt released Soltan in 2015, although his father remains in prison. He has attempted to build a new life in Virginia, advocating for fellow political prisoners still in Egypt and pursuing a master's degree at Georgetown University. But memories from his dark cell in Tora still haunt him. 'There's this perpetual, compounded trauma every single day,' he said, 'where you get up and look in the mirror and see the scars and cigarette burns and the bullet marks...it changes you.' Eric Lewis, a lawyer with Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, who represents Soltan, says he hopes the case sends a message to Egypt's government 'that they cannot commit crimes against humanity and then seek haven in the United States.' An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in Egypt's jails, according to Human Rights Watch, including many journalists and critics held on vague terrorism charges without trial. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who came to power in 2013, has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent. The lawsuit lists el-Sissi, intelligence chief Abbas Kamel and three other former senior security officials as culpable, saying that they can be served if they set foot in the United States.",0.0

Gov. Kate Brown has dispatched 50 Oregon National Guard soldiers, plus 100 Oregon State Police troopers, to assist Portland police in the aftermath of public protests of George Floyd's death. But Brown rebuffed requests by Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and U.S. Attorney Billy Williams for a mobilization of the Guard after three nights of street disorders. Brown said the 50 soldiers will help police in a support function, so that police are on the front lines. They will not bear arms and will not have a public presence. ""Our goal, and the goal of the overwhelming number of protesters, is to reduce violence,"" Brown said at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""You don't reduce violence by putting soldiers on the streets. ""Soldiers on the streets across America is what President Trump wants. He has made that clear this morning (in a conference call) with governors across the United States. Trump wants the governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force."" While Brown was speaking, Trump called violent protests ""acts of domestic terror"" and vowed to respond with an ""overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled."" He said that would include military forces. Superintendent Travis Hampton said the Oregon State Police has good relations with the Portland Police Bureau and the Oregon National Guard. ""Demonstrations of this size pose great challenges for law enforcement,"" he said. ""But I have no reservations abut putting our personnel under the direction of Chief (Jami) Resch."" Brown said about 100 State Police troopers, of a total of 700 available, would be drawn from elsewhere in Oregon for duty in Portland. She said it stretches the agency thin. Portland City Commissioner JoAnn Hardesty said that when Brown broached the idea of the limited deployment, her initial reaction was ""no, no, no"" But Hardesty said that after she consulted with Chief Resch, who said some city officers had been on duty three straight nights, she changed her mind. ""I think we can all agree that tired police officers do not serve the public interest,"" she said. Hardesty said that in a previous role as a community organizer, she would be among those leading the protests. She has been a critic of poor relations between police and the African American community. Given the disorders of the past three nights, she said, ""we have to close this down."" Floyd died as police in Minneapolis were arresting him, one of the officers placing a knee on Floyd's neck. Sen. Lew Frederick, D-Portland, said the fear that minorities have during police stops is real. As a reporter for Portland television station in the early 1990s, Frederick said he and a photographer faced a gun drawn by a King City police officer. (Today, King City's mayor is black.) As recently as 2015, while Frederick was a state representative, he was stopped by police en route to his home in the Irvington neighborhood, where has has lived since 1977. Frederick also decried the violence that has occurred after largely peaceful demonstrations to honor Floyd and protest police misconduct. ""But it is not a reason to shut down free expression by the majority of people,"" he said. Frederick said he and other members of the People of Color Caucus within the Legislature — seven in the House and two in the Senate — plan legislation to improve police training. A series of bills will follow up on legislation passed in recent years, including a ban on racial profiling and mandatory collection by police agencies of who gets stopped. ""There is not any one fix that makes the justice system fair,"" Hardesty said. Brown said she stands with others who have protested the status quo on race relations: ""To everyone who is hurting right now, I want to say I see you. I hear you. I stand with you. And I add my voice to yours. ""Years and years of failure to reform police practices. Years of failure to hold police officers accountable. Years of failure to bring real reforms to our criminal justice system, which incarcerates Black Americans at five times the rate of white Americans. ""I count myself as one of the many white politicians whose good intentions haven't done enough to tackle the scourge of systemic racism."" This email address is being protected from spambots.

1622797302,2020-06-01 21:37:00,Fourth Night Of Portland Demonstrations Begins With Calls For Change,https://www.opb.org/news/article/fourth-night-portland-oregon-george-floyd-demonstrations-protest/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"Massive crowds gathered in Portland on Monday night for a fourth evening of protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis who was killed after an officer pushed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. But unlike previous nights of protests, there was a limited police presence on Portland streets, and demonstrators remained peaceful throughout five hours of marching. During the night, protesters demanded leaders take action to address racial inequities and police violence. Jonathan Levinson/OPB The evening’s demonstration began around 6 p.m., with a gathering near Revolution Hall in Southeast Portland. Speakers there talked about the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and informed the crowd about their legal rights during demonstrations. “We all saw the video. We all know what is going on in America,” demonstrator Lyfe Tavarres said at the gathering, referring to the video Floyd’s death that has sparked a national outcry. “We have a voice. We are the change,” Tavarres said. Jonathan Levinson/OPB That message carried throughout the evening, as the organizers of the event — many of them young people of color — implored the group to stop anyone who seemed eager to cause vandalism. At one point during the night, the crowd shouted down a person who tried to tear up an American flag at Pioneer Courthouse Square. Much of the entirely peaceful protest took place after 8 p.m. when Mayor Ted Wheeler had renewed a third night of curfew for the city. Portland leaders said the curfew was meant as a tool for police to use if necessary, but officers largely remained tolerant of people breaking the rule. “I actually think we should be backing off on the curfew because clearly it is having the opposite impact we’re wanting to have,” Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said at a press conference earlier in the day, noting people had shown up the previous night to oppose the restriction. Jonathan Levinson/OPB After marching from Revolution Hall, protesters took to the Burnside Bridge — where hundreds of people lay face down on the pavement for nearly nine minutes in memory of Floyd. Ahead of Monday’s event, Portland police closed a large swath of downtown that encompassed the Multnomah County Justice Center and other buildings that had been the scene of tensions and damage over the weekend. “The closure of this area is due to ongoing public safety concerns and ongoing criminal acts,” PPB said in a statement. “Violations of this order may result in arrest.” A crowd of thousands of people eventually made their way to the Justice Center, where police over loudspeakers warned them to stay back. The demonstrators at times took a knee, raised their fists and held up peace signs. They called on the Portland police to open a dialogue and end a militarized police response that contributed to clashes at previous nights’ protests. By 9:30 p.m., a packed crowd filled Pioneer Courthouse Square, where more speeches took place and music played from loudspeakers. “We have not witnessed any vandalism or destruction. This has been an hours-long protest that has remained peaceful. Thank you and we see you and hear you!” the Portland Police Bureau tweeted. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Though the demonstration led by Black and brown Portlanders stayed peaceful, some demonstrators criticized how focused political leaders and media coverage has been on vandalism, rather than police brutality. “When Colin Kaepernick took a knee in the NFL, they said, ‘Don’t do that, it’s not the time or place,’” Portland resident John Johnson told OPB. “One by one, Black stars stood up and used their platform to speak their mind, and they said, ‘That person should stick to what they do best.’ … So now we’re out looting and burning things — that’s also not the right way. So, which is the right way?” The peaceful demonstration in Portland capped a day of similar actions across the state, as Oregonians in Medford, Hermiston, Pendleton, Eugene, Salem and elsewhere called for equality. The lead up to Monday’s demonstrations had seen considerable tension over whether Oregon Gov. Kate Brown would deploy the state’s National Guard to help maintain order, as other states and cities have done. Jonathan Levinson/OPB Though she said she wrestled with the decision, Brown ultimately chose to send out 50 National Guard soldiers to Portland . Their presence was not seen at Monday’s demonstration. The governor drew a distinction between her deployment of the National Guard and President Trump’s calls for harsh crackdowns on protesters. Actions of demonstrators made that distinction even more clear in Portland on Monday. As helicopters buzzed low over crowds in Washington, D.C., and police continued to deploy tear gas, Portlanders chanted “Say his name! George Floyd!” and danced to music across the Burnside Bridge before wrapping their protest before midnight. “We are not entering martial law. We are not going to have armed people on every corner in the city of Portland. We will make sure that the space is there for people to exercise their Constitutional rights,” Hardesty said earlier in the day. “And I want to make sure we don’t forget why people are on the streets in the first place: People took to the street because people have enough of the inequality that African Americans experience in this country.”",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore. — Mayor Ted Wheeler told MSNBC he's heard anecdotally that ""out of towners"" were coming to Portland to cause problems at the demonstrations. Wheeler was so concerned about outsiders infiltrating Portland protests, that he closed the exit and on-ramps into the city Sunday night. While there is no way to confirm where the thousands of protesters demonstrating in Portland since Friday live, arrest records show the majority of people arrested live in the Portland metro area. According to the Portland Police Bureau, 102 people have been arrested from the demonstrations since Friday. Based on the available court filings, 26 people listed addresses in Portland, Beaverton, Salem, and Vancouver, Washington. Six people arrested were listed as transient or homeless. One person listed Roseburg, Oregon as his home address and one person was listed as living in Richmond, California. Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis said it's too early to blame to the bulk of issues on people living outside the metro area. ""It's hard to tell, we have made a large number of arrests but that's a small fraction of those involved in criminal activity,"" said Davis.

Story continues The officer ignored Floyd's pleas for him to stop: ""I can't breathe... Please, the knee in my neck, I can't breathe."" The lack of charges brought upon Chauvin nor the other three officers standing by the Minneapolis Police Department sparked nationwide outrage leading to national protests and riots against police brutality and public pressure to arrest the four officers. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

1622882320,2020-06-01 22:08:22,Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200601/trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation's governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

(AP) "" Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city's police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video. 'This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,' Fischer said. 'Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.' Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. 'This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,' the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an 'honest and transparent way that will not take months.' U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine 'the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.' Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. 'I've never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,' he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. 'Over the years he's been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,"" he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several 'persons of interest' were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant "" 'just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue' "" when the soldiers arrived. 'As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,"" Smith said. 'It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.' He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. ___ Associated Press contributors include Claire Galofaro and Rebecca Reynolds Yonker in Louisville.

Kate Brown said Monday she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that ""is exactly what President Trump wants."" At a news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and would activate 50 unarmed National Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier Monday, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as ""weak"" in teleconference and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing during some demonstrations. ""You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,"" Brown, a Democrat, countered. ""Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform."" Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. daily. On Monday, however, the police went even further and ordered all citizens out of a large area of downtown Portland starting at 4 p.m. On Twitter, the agency said demonstrators could protest outside the no-go zone. ""All persons must leave the area immediately. Failure to leave will subject you to arrest. Leave now,"" the tweets read. Police have arrested at least 75 people in the past three nights during demonstrations over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck. Eleven adults were arrested during protests Sunday and three juveniles were detained. Earlier Monday, authorities said projectiles — including ""large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks"" — were thrown at officers and windows in a federal courthouse had been shattered. Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of the demonstrators and said she refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation. ""This is a very difficult time for our state and our entire nation. Senseless violence does not honor George Floyd’s death,"" she said, adding later that ""having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants."" Earlier Monday, U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy J. Williams had asked Brown to deploy National Guard troops to the city to guard infrastructure such as federal courthouses and police offices. ""What I saw at the Justice Center …. was sickening. This has to stop and in order for that to happen in the city of Portland, we need help,"" Williams said of the protests Sunday. ""We need bodies, we need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence. This just cannot keep up."" The violence came after thousands of protesters held a largely peaceful demonstration outside the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. At one point, some police officers took a knee with protesters and three people in the crowd had a private talk with Police Chief Jami Resch, authorities said. ""We saw people at their very worst and we saw people at their very best,"" said Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis, who thanked protesters who remained peaceful. ""Our strategy last night was to make sure that whatever happened, the police bureau was not the cause and so we decided to give them a greater space and give them the time to express themselves."" The Multnomah County GOP criticized the police response in a statement, saying the Portland Police Bureau and Wheeler were being too easy on protesters and should not have allowed them to violate the curfew order without consequences. ""After all of Portland’s experience with mass protests, can the police really be so incompetent as to fail to encircle these crowds and arrest them all? Of course not. This is a deliberate policy choice to promoting further disorder,"" said Chairman James Buchal. Elsewhere in Oregon, authorities said between 7,000 and 10,000 people gathered at the federal courthouse in Eugene on Sunday and marched in a peaceful demonstration. After the event ended, about 1,000 people continued to protest. In Salem, up to 400 people marched and got into a confrontation with police that resulted in six to eight arrests. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. The encounter was caught by a bystander on video.

This was a cry for action. A call for reform. A community in mourning. Then very late at night, much smaller groups decided to break windows and damage property. Senseless violence does not honor George Floyd’s death or create accountability. Only the hard work of racial justice will.” “To everyone who is hurting right now, I want to say I see you. I hear you. I stand with you. And I add my voice to yours. Years and years of failure to reform police practices. Years of failure to hold police officers accountable.

1622903738,2020-06-01 03:00:00,Lake Oswego community members hold vigil for George Floyd,http://portlandtribune.com/lor/48-news/468757-379550-lake-oswego-community-members-hold-vigil-for-george-floyd-,en,False,,1392,canby herald,http://canbyherald.com/,"Lake Oswego residents hold vigil for George Floyd, peaceful protests Local community members peacefully protested Sunday, Thursday and Friday in downtown Lake Oswego Lake Oswego community members lined A Avenue and State Street Sunday, May 31, as candles were lit and signs were held to commemorate the life of George Floyd — an African-American man who was killed May 25 by asphyxiation after a Minneapolis police officer held him on the ground and pressed his knee into his neck for almost nine minutes. The vigil, organized by Lake Oswego's Respond to Racism organization, was meant to honor not only Floyd but also Ahmaud Arbery, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor and other victims of police violence. ""Our intent was that it was going to be peaceful and a vigil,"" said Terri Kraemer, one of Respond to Racism's organizers. ""There's a real need in our community to show support and to help with healing but also to help with change."" Roughly 40 people gathered — spaced out on the streets — holding signs with messages like ""Because I'm white I can go jogging Ahmaud Arbery could not,"" ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" Others drove by with supportive messages and honked their honors in solidarity. Willie Poinsette, co-founder of Respond to Racism, said the theme of the vigil was justice and that she was pleased with the amount of local support. The point of the vigil was to recognize ""that many, many lives have been lost over the years through (shear police brutality and murder by police),"" Poinsette said. ""We wanted to call attention to that. Sort of like, 'Wake up folks in Lake Oswego. Black lives matter: black men, black women, boys, girls.'"" Nearby businesses including the Lake Theater & Cafe showed their support by writing ""Justice for George Floyd"" on their marquee and posting on their Instagram with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. stating ""In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."" Their post also showed a hateful message from an anonymous Lake Oswego business owner, which they said wasn't the first negative email they received. ""These protests reveal the necessity of countless other sweeping changes needed to put us on paths of solidarity and equal opportunity in our society,"" Lake Theater's Instagram post read. ""Here in Lake Oswego, we are, for better or worse, sheltered from much of the hardship and conflict of these times. But be not silent."" Kraemer said the idea for the vigil came to fruition after a community member suggested it. The Respond to Racism leadership team decided to proceed with it cautiously due to COVID-19 concerns. ""So we invited a small group of people to join us in the vigil, trying to keep it around 25 to 30 people, but then word got out,"" Kraemer said. They decided to let the entire Respond to Racism community know so no one would be hurt or offended that they weren't invited, which under normal circumstances Kraemer said would not have been the case. If people didn't feel comfortable physically distancing on the streets, they were invited to drive by with signs in their vehicle windows and honk to show support. ""We had no idea the tremendous response,"" said Kraemer, adding that there were at least six or eight people who happened to walk by and stayed to join,as well as a group of four or five young adults who drove by and saw the group, made signs and came back to join the vigil. ""I believe that's because people are reeling from the murder of Mr. Floyd and also the other murders that have happened recently, so I think trying to find a way to express the anger and the hurt and trying to find a way to show support for our black community is important for most of our citizens."" A demonstration was also held in downtown Lake Oswego Thursday afternoon, with another scheduled Friday. But not every community has had such peaceful protests. And while the Sunday vigil was peaceful, Kraemer said not all protests need to be peaceful. ""We have been having peaceful protests for decades and it hasn't changed anything,"" Kraemer said in an email to the Review. ""If non-peaceful protests are what it takes for there to be systemic changes to end racism in all of our systems (justice, health care, education etc.) then so be it."" Many protests across the country have ended in violence. ""I think that it's important for people to distinguish between the protesters who are protesting about the killing of Mr. Floyd and the killing of other black men and women by police and those with other agendas,"" Kraemer said. ""We need to distinguish that grieving process and the pain from people who are using violence for other reasons and not out of respect for Mr. Floyd and not out of the desire to see a change in the justice system."" Poinsette said she wasn't pleased with the rioting and destruction of property following many of the peaceful protests across the country. ""Those people are not about what we're talking about in terms of making a change,"" said Poinsette, adding that it's important to have the old and young come together to talk about what needs to change in the United States and to bring people together rather than tear them apart. The Lake Oswego School District also sent a letter from Superintendent Lora de la Cruz to the school community expressing disgust and sadness with George Floyd's death. ""Many of our children have undoubtedly viewed this horrific event, and have now witnessed, with the rest of us, the ensuing violence and anger erupting across the country,"" the email read. ""I am heartbroken about yet another person's life being taken, another family losing a loved one, and another incident adding to the collective and historical wounding of our communities of color, and indeed each and every one of us."" De la Cruz offered support to students and said that those who wish to talk are welcome to reach out to staff, administrators, counselors, or any other trusted adult in the school community. ""To our neighbors, friends, community members of color, I want to convey this: I see you and I hear you. I understand you have a different lived experience than I do, and I want to understand so that we can grow and heal together,"" the email read. ""We strive to do our part to build an environment that is safe and inclusive. We sometimes fail in that mission when a student, a family or a staff member feels unseen, unheard or unwelcome. Please know that we'll never stop listening, learning and working to fulfill our responsibilities to our community."" Lake Oswego Police Department Sgt. Tom Hamann said the department belongs to the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, which released a letter May 28 in conjunction with Oregon State Sheriffs' Association and Oregon State Police in response to Floyd's death — and agrees with the message in the letter, reassuring communities they don't condone that type of police conduct. ""Public trust and accountability for police agencies and police officers is crucial to a safe, inclusive community. We recognize that even isolated incidents of police misconduct anywhere undermine public trust everywhere,"" the letter read. ""We are dismayed and disgusted when the actions of a few tarnish the reputation of our honorable law enforcement profession and undermine the heroic work our police officers perform in service to our communities. We will continue to work hard to strengthen the confidence Oregonians have in our work and we value the trust you place in us."" Hamann said they don't train officers to kneel on someone in that manner and do not agree with the police tactics that were used. ""It damaged the trust of the rest of the police officers that are doing the right thing every day,"" Hamann said. ""We feel that it's absolutely everyone's right to peacefully assemble and demonstrate and express their opinions about what they feel is happening in the country … The issue we have is with the violence that's been happening and the property damage that's been happening."" Bruce Poinsette, vice president of Respond to Racism, said all officers should be required to wear body cams. ""It's hard to be like, 'That's not worth it,' when we see the alternative,"" Poinsette said in response to the cost of body cameras. ""I'd like to see more defined de-escalation training with actual accountability measures."" Willie Poinsette agreed and said in the case of George Floyd, without the video footage, the story might have been different. ""I think they're (body cameras) valuable and I don't care about cost,"" Willie said. ""A body camera cannot cost more than a life."" Bruce Poinsette said he's spoken with members of the LOPD and thinks that although they are doing a lot of the right things, that it ""can't just be a few people trying to do the right thing."" ""It can't just be individuals, we're talking about systems,"" he said, adding that there must be measures in place to make sure officers are learning and applying what they learn — and if not there should be discipline. He added that people shouldn't demonize others who are upset because they don't have their basic safety rights being respected. He has noticed people discussing who's actually participating in the riots and doesn't like to feed into that conversation. ""It takes the light off the fact that people are fed up with police brutality; people are fed up with white supremacy,"" he said. Hamann said there are issues that need to be addressed and that LOPD is working hard to be transparent and are doing the right thing, right now. He said the police agency continues to try and develop positive relationships with organizations like Respond to Racism and the community as a whole. LOPD partners with Word is Bond, a Portland-based nonprofit organization whose mission is to build positive relationships between black men and law enforcement, and that has helped to better build those positive relationships and start conversation. ""It's just a sad circumstance for Mr. Floyd's family, for the community, for the department and the officers I'm sure (who) work there that are doing the right thing and are good police officers, our profession as a whole, and the unrest all this has caused in our community and in our nation,"" Hamann said. Willie Poinsette reiterated that most police aren't bad but there are some ""bad eggs."" ""So as we recruit, I hope they are recruiting people that are not of some of the old mindsets and some of the types of people that went into police work,"" she said. ""If they're trigger happy or violence happy then that's a person who needs some serious mental health support and should not be a police officer."" She added that she appreciates the relationship she has with the LOPD and that she's able to express her concerns with the police force. ""I like the fact that he (the chief) has an open door for that,"" Poinsette said. Bruce Poinsette said people showing up to the vigil to show their support and raise awareness was meaningful but there is a more consistent, everyday need. ""That tells me I think the next step especially in a place like Lake Oswego is building a larger coalition … and really mobilize with that,"" he added. ""I hope to see the momentum continue building.""",0.0

Jay Inslee said Monday that while the damage from weekend protests that turned violent must be condemned and those responsible prosecuted, “we will not allow that to obscure the justice of the underlying protest.” Inslee said that people are justifiably outraged following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota and emphasized the constitutional right to protest. But he said that “violence and destruction has no place in this.” “We just can’t allow violence to hijack peaceful protest,” Inslee said at a news conference. Demonstrators in Washington and around the country have been protesting the killing of Floyd, a black man who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. On Monday afternoon large crowds of protesters again gathered in downtown Seattle for speeches and to march through the city's core. Hundreds gathered outside City Hall. North of downtown, near the University Village shopping mall, police barricaded a grocery store's windows after some people smashed them. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced the Northwest's largest city would again have a curfew Monday evening following days of protests that turned violent, with storefronts smashed and items stolen. At a news conference, Durkan said the curfew would begin at 6 p.m. and last until 5 a.m. Bellevue also said it would have a 5 p.m. curfew following vandalism and theft in that city's downtown Sunday. There were curfews in Seattle on Saturday and Sunday nights as well. Durkan said most of the thousands of protesters were peaceful, but there was an element that engaged in “violence, looting and chaos.” In a statement, the Washington director of the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the curfew orders, calling them “chilling.” ""They open the door to selective enforcement, potentially magnifying the very harms that protestors and communities have been demanding be addressed for decades,” said Michele Storms, executive director of the ACLU of Washington. Seattle's police watchdog, the Office of Professional Accountability, said it was investigating 10 alleged incidences of aggressive behavior by police following the weekend protests following thousands of individual complaints. These include reports of police pepper spraying a young girl and punching a person on the ground who was being arrested, OPA said. Police Chief Carmen Best said a small number of protests “tore the city up” and caused “millions of dollars in damage.” Durkan said the damage was widespread Saturday, with 90 businesses in the city's International District alone affected. Authorities said 57 people were arrested Saturday. Inslee activated the National Guard following vandalism and mass theft in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities over the weekend, including Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. “The guard are unarmed peacekeepers,"" he said. “They are there to help support local communities.” Karina Shagren, a spokeswoman for the National Guard, said that about 350 National Guard members are deployed in the state Monday, with about 20 in Spokane and the remainder in the King County metro areas. Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. Inslee called the comments by the president the “rants of a very insecure man.” Monday afternoon, Trump threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests, and said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. In an emailed statement in response to the president's comments, Inslee wrote that Trump “has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office.” “He cowers at the feet of authoritarians around the world,” Inslee said. “Now he uses the most supreme power of the presidency in a desperate attempt to hide his timidity and vapidity. I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.”",0.0

'I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,' Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. 'When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.' Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation's largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They're being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation's 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. 'Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,' said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. 'Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward."" The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago's first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America's dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump's divisive tweets in which he called protesters 'thugs' and said 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' 'It's impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,' Lightfoot said. 'Being black in America should not be a death sentence.' The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,' Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures "" something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. 'I think that we're seeing some of this play out in real time,' Brown said. 'She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that's kind of a mode in which we're seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they're speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar."" Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state's third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. 'We're trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we're trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,"" Warren said. 'A lot of times we get branded with the 'angry black woman syndrome' when we're speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride."" 'No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that's coming toward them,' Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco's London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A'shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. 'This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,' Gholar said. 'Black women running for office and winning, it isn't an anomaly. They're also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they're inspiring to run."" Although gains have been made, Carr said there's still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country's population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. 'All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,' Carr said. 'So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.' ___ Kat Stafford is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

You can do it. Throw on some Kendrick Lamar and get your head in the right space. Pour yourself a big old glass of salt juice. Draw an ice bath and fire up the cryotherapy pod and the infrared sauna. Then just pull the plug on him. You know you want to. You could answer the existential question of whether @realDonaldTrump even exists if he doesn’t exist on Twitter. I tweet, therefore I am. Dorsey meets Descartes. All it would take is one sweet click to force the greatest troll in the history of the internet to meet his maker. Maybe he just disappears in an orange cloud of smoke, screaming, “I’m melllllllting.” Do Trump — and the world — a favor and send him back into the void whence he came. And then go have some fun: Meditate and fast for days on end! Our country is going through biological, economic and societal convulsions. We can’t trust the powerful forces in this nation to tell us the truth or do the right thing. In fact, not only can we not trust them, we have every reason to believe they’re gunning for us. In Washington, the Trump administration’s deception about the virus was lethal. On Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, the fat cats who carved up the country, drained us dry and left us with no safety net profiteered off the virus. In Minneapolis, the barbaric death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on him for almost nine minutes showed yet again that black Americans have everything to fear from some who are charged with protecting them. As if that weren’t enough, from the slough of our despond, we have to watch Donald Trump duke it out with the lords of the cloud in a contest to see who can destroy our democracy faster. I wish I could go along with those who say this dark period of American life will ultimately make us nicer and simpler and more contemplative. How can that happen when the whole culture has been reengineered to put us at each other’s throats? Trump constantly torques up the tribal friction and cruelty, even as Twitter and Facebook refine their systems to ratchet up rage. It is amazing that a septuagenarian became the greatest exploiter of social media. Trump and Twitter were a match made in hell. The Wall Street Journal had a chilling report a few days ago that Facebook’s own research in 2018 revealed that “our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness. If left unchecked,” Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.” Mark Zuckerberg shelved the research. Why not just let all the bots trying to undermine our elections and spreading false information about the coronavirus and right-wing conspiracy theories and smear campaigns run amok? Sure, we’re weakening our society, but the weird, infantile maniacs running Silicon Valley must be allowed to rake in more billions and finish their mission of creating a giant cyberorganism of people, one huge and lucrative ball of rage. “The shareholders of Facebook decided, ‘If you can increase my stock tenfold, we can put up with a lot of rage and hate,’” says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “These platforms have very dangerous profit motives. When you monetize rage at such an exponential rate, it’s bad for the world. These guys don’t look left or right; they just look down. They’re willing to promote white nationalism if there’s money in it. The rise of social media will be seen as directly correlating to the decline of Western civilization.” Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn’t as valuable as Facebook’s, made some mild moves against the president who has been spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. He added footnotes clarifying false Trump tweets about mail-in ballots and put a warning label on the president’s tweet about the Minneapolis riots that echoes the language of a Miami police chief in 1967 and segregationist George Wallace: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,” said one friend of the Twitter chief’s. “He’s like somebody trapped in a maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.” Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think Facebook should be “the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” It was a sickening display that made even some loyal Facebook staffers queasy. As The Verge’s Casey Newton reported, some employees objected to the company’s rationale in internal posts. “I have to say I am finding the contortions we have to go through incredibly hard to stomach,” one wrote. “All this points to a very high risk of a violent escalation and civil unrest in November, and if we fail the test case here, history will not judge us kindly.” Trump, furious that Dorsey would attempt to rein him in on the very platform that catapulted him into the White House, immediately decided to try to rein in Dorsey. He signed an executive order that might strip liability protection from social media sites, which would mean they would have to more assiduously police false and defamatory posts. Now that social media sites are behemoths, Galloway thinks that the removal of the Communications Decency Act makes a lot of sense, even if the president is trying to do it for the wrong reasons. Trump does not seem to realize, however, that he’s removing his own protection. He huffs and puffs about freedom of speech when he really wants the freedom to be vile. “It’s the mother of all cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face moves,” says Galloway. The president wants to say things on Twitter that he will not be allowed to say if he exerts this control over Twitter. In a sense, it’s Trump versus his own brain. If Twitter can be sued for what people say on it, how can Trump continue to torment? Wouldn’t thousands of his own tweets have to be deleted? “He’d be the equivalent of a slippery floor at a store that sells equipment for hip replacements,” says Galloway, who also posits that, in our hyperpoliticized world, this will turn Twitter into a Democratic site and Facebook into a Republican one. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose district encompasses Twitter, said that it did little good for Dorsey to put up a few fact-checks while letting Trump’s rants about murder and other “misrepresentations” stay up. “Facebook, all of them, they are all about making money,” the speaker said. “Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts.” She crisply concluded that “all they want is to not pay taxes; they got their tax break in 2017,” and “they don’t want to be regulated, so they pander to the White House.” C’mon, Jack.

1622947406,2020-06-03 02:04:08,Douthat: The case against riots,https://www.registerguard.com/opinion/20200602/douthat-case-against-riots?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"In the origin myth of post-1960s liberalism, all the defeats that the Democratic Party suffered in the years of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were owed to the party’s heroic support for civil rights, which rectified a great injustice but opened the way for the Republicans to build majorities on racial backlash. Like most myths, this story contains pieces of the truth. The battle over civil rights did accelerate the regional realignment of the parties; racial backlash did help the GOP make gains in the once-Democratic South. But what ultimately doomed the old liberal majority wasn’t just support for civil rights; that was on the ballot in 1964, when Barry Goldwater won the heart of the old Confederacy but Lyndon Johnson won everywhere else. Rather, liberalism unraveled amid the subsequent nationwide wave of crime, unrest and disorder, which liberal mandarins and liberal machine politicians alike were unable to successfully manage or contain. The riots of the ’60s, from Watts to Washington, D.C., were only part of this story; the wider surge of murder, battery and theft probably mattered as much to realignment. But there is a striking pattern of evidence, teased out in the research of the Princeton University political scientist Omar Wasow, showing how peaceful civil rights protests helped Democrats win white votes, and then violence pushed white voters toward Republicans. Looking at data from the civil rights era, Wasow argues that “proximity to black-led nonviolent protests increased white Democratic vote-share whereas proximity to black-led violent protests caused substantively important declines” — enough to tip the 1968 election from Hubert Humphrey to Nixon. More broadly, in news coverage and public opinion from those years, nonviolent protests (especially in the face of segregationist violence) increased support for civil rights, while violent protests tipped public opinion away from the protesters, and toward a stronger desire for what Nixon called law and order, and Wasow calls “social control.” Some of this research was published in the spring of 2015, when the protests-turned-riots in Ferguson and Baltimore attracted left-wing and radical defenders. Back then, the center-left writer Jonathan Chait cited Wasow’s findings in an essay accusing the pro-riot radicals of being politically delusional: “The physical damage inflicted upon poor urban neighborhoods by rioting,” he wrote, “does not have the compensating virtue of easing the way for more progressive policies; instead, it compounds the damage by promoting a regressive backlash.” In response, the more left-wing columnist Ryan Cooper argued that, in effect, that was then and this is now: Maybe riots weakened liberalism in the past, but the riots of 2015 were more localized and therefore less threatening, the America of 2015 was less white and therefore less easily threatened, and the Republicans of 2015 were “talking about prison reform, not Willie Horton.” I would submit that subsequent events vindicated Chait, and that in hindsight the riots of 2015 — as well as the late Obama-era crime spike, and a cluster of high-profile cop killings in 2016 — helped create a late-1960s backlash moment in miniature. Republicans didn’t abandon prison reform; indeed, they eventually helped pass a criminal-justice reform bill. But they stopped talking about that issue, or talking like civil libertarians in general, and they nominated a figure for president who sounded like Nixon on a good day and George Wallace on the rest. Which meant that 18 months after the Baltimore riots, the violence’s major legacy was a still-wounded city — and the presidency of Donald Trump. You can’t take this as proof that rioting never works, that it never succeeds in calling attention to an injustice that a more peaceful protest might incline the comfortable to downplay or ignore. But the political history of both the 1960s and the 2010s suggests a strong presumption against the political effectiveness of looting or vandalism or arson, to go along with the direct costs for the communities where riots are most likely to break out. For radicals, this presumption doesn’t require shedding tears for the insurers of, say, a ransacked Minneapolis Target. It just requires recognizing that most spasms of robbery or arson aren’t the revolution but often a ritual reaffirmation of the status quo — a period of misrule that doesn’t try to establish an alternative order or permanently change any hierarchies, as a true revolution would, but instead leaves the lower orders poorer and the well-insured upper classes more or less restored. For liberals, meanwhile, or anyone committed to reform without revolution, recognizing how the politics of riots usually play out imposes a special burden to forestall and contain them — and when that isn’t possible, to clearly distinguish the higher cause from the chaos trailing in its wake. My suspicion is that this will be more easily accomplished in 2020 than it was in 2016 or 1968. Across his presidency Trump has been more a Wallace than a Nixon, less “law and order“ than “the law for thee but not for me,” and his obvious disregard for civic peace makes it hard for him to campaign as its custodian. At the same time, the manifest injustice of George Floyd’s treatment by the Minneapolis police has imposed a limit on Trump’s demagoguery; even the president claimed to be honoring Floyd’s memory in the same breath that he attacked the rioters. And unlike four years ago, in 2020 Trump’s waning reelection hopes probably depend on winning a higher-than-usual number of black and Latino men, which mean that the politics of racial backlash are more fraught for his strategists than one might usually expect. Meanwhile Joe Biden, as a moderate Democrat with a law-and-order past who won his party’s nomination with strong African-American support, is arguably better positioned than some Democratic politicians to balance outrage over racial injustice with a message of peace, nonviolence, calm. Biden probably won’t go to war with the parts of his coalition that are inclined to portray riots as necessary uprisings or cathartic wealth-redistribution, but he has a primary season’s worth of experience ignoring them. So if Minneapolis is the beginning of a season of protest, he may find it much easier to balance moral outrage with reassurance than a nominee more beholden to the left. And in striking that balance he would carry on, rather than betray, the legacy of the most successful civil rights activists. Martin Luther King Jr. became more politically radical in his last years, but his opposition to rioting was a constant. “Every time a riot develops,” he warned just months before his death, “it helps George Wallace.” If we are headed for a long, hot, virus-shadowed summer, those are words that a liberalism that doesn’t want to help Donald Trump would do well to keep in mind.

(AP) "" Several Democratic governors on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump's threat to deploy the U.S. military unless they dispatch National Guard units to 'dominate the streets' in reaction to the violence that has erupted across the country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an 'incendiary moment' by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 'I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors 'weak' and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that 'we can use at any moment.' 'I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays 'no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.' 'This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is 'misinformed.' ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.' In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. 'You don't defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,' Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. 'Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.' She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments 'noise' and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore. — Mayor Ted Wheeler told MSNBC he's heard anecdotally that ""out of towners"" were coming to Portland to cause problems at the demonstrations. Wheeler was so concerned about outsiders infiltrating Portland protests, that he closed the exit and on-ramps into the city Sunday night. While there is no way to confirm where the thousands of protesters demonstrating in Portland since Friday live, arrest records show the majority of people arrested live in the Portland metro area. According to the Portland Police Bureau, 102 people have been arrested from the demonstrations since Friday. Based on the available court filings, 26 people listed addresses in Portland, Beaverton, Salem, and Vancouver, Washington. Six people arrested were listed as transient or homeless. One person listed Roseburg, Oregon as his home address and one person was listed as living in Richmond, California. Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis said it's too early to blame to the bulk of issues on people living outside the metro area. ""It's hard to tell, we have made a large number of arrests but that's a small fraction of those involved in criminal activity,"" said Davis. Here is a full list of people arrested by PPB since Friday: May 29-June 1: 35-year-old Anthony Leuci was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer, Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree, Resist the Arrest, two counts of Assaulting a Public Safety Officer and Riot. 22-year-old Samuel Wharton was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer 22-year-old Logan Watkin was arrested for Riot, Criminal Mischief in the Second Degree, Curfew and Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree. 31-year-old Clayton Eisaman was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer, Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Curfew. 27-year-old Julian Grijalva was arrested for Riot, Attempt to Assault a Peace Officer and Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree. 43-year-old Joseph Haddenhan was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer and Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree. 36-year-old Darren Stephens was arrested for Theft in the First Degree. 25-year-old Hannah Jaquiss was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer, Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree, and Escape in the Third Degree. 25-year-old Norman Kemp was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer, Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree, Curfew and Warrant. 29-year-old Elliot Tippie was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer and Curfew. 18-year-old Shakira Schroeder was arrested for Interfering with a Peace Officer, Curfew and Warrant. *Richard Cavanaugh-18 Years-old-Burglary II and Riot.

Thousands gathered at Revolution Hall at 6 p.m. before marching across the Willamette River on the Burnside Bridge, where they eventually congregated at Pioneer Courthouse Square for hours of speeches and demonstration. Organizers eventually led the column back onto the east side as the rally entered its fifth hour; that's when a smaller group of black-clad anti-fascists known as antifa approached police roadblocks. ""It appears that most people from the group downtown have dispersed. Officers made some arrests after glass bottles and rocks were thrown at them,"" police said around 1 a.m. on Tuesday, June 2.

The cops knew there were too man y of us to attack, so instead they hired infiltrators to take over the protest, and pacify it. This is extremely dangerous... — PNW Youth Liberation Front (@PNWYLF) June 2, 2020 Read our previous reporting below: Portland braced for the fourth straight night of protests on Monday, June 1. Portland Police Bureau announced the closure of a four-by-four square of city blocks — from Southwest 1st Avenue to 5th Avenue, and from Southwest Taylor Street to Jefferson Street — around 3:20 p.m. Police said the emergency closure would halt all vehicle and pedestrian traffic into the area containing the Multnomah County Justice Center and federal courthouse. ""The closure of this area is due to ongoing public safety concerns and ongoing criminal acts,"" police said. ""Violations of this order may result in arrest."" Police asked protesters to gather at Waterfront Park instead. Demonstrations were planned in the Buckman neighborhood near Revolution Hall and at Northeast 57th Avenue at Sandy Boulevard during the day. TriMet said it was routing buses and trains out of a 16-block area in downtown at 4 p.m. Mayor Ted Wheeler has extended the 8 p.m. city-wide curfew to continue to be in effect on Monday, and Gov. Kate Brown announced that around 50 unarmed National Guard troops would be deployed to protect facilities.

This was a cry for action. A call for reform. A community in mourning. Then very late at night, much smaller groups decided to break windows and damage property. Senseless violence does not honor George Floyd’s death or create accountability. Only the hard work of racial justice will.” “To everyone who is hurting right now, I want to say I see you. I hear you. I stand with you. And I add my voice to yours. Years and years of failure to reform police practices. Years of failure to hold police officers accountable. Years of failure to bring real reforms to our criminal justice system, which incarcerates Black Americans at five times the rate of white Americans.” To help protect property and ensure peaceful protests, the Governor also announced she would be sending 100 Oregon State Police to work with the Portland Police Bureau today, as well as 50 members of the Oregon National Guard to serve in a support function only.

Kate Brown said Monday she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that “is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and would activate 50 unarmed National Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier Monday, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as “weak” in teleconference and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing during some demonstrations. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, countered. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform."" Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. nightly. On Monday, however, the police went even further and ordered all citizens out of a large area of downtown Portland starting at 4 p.m. On Twitter, the agency said demonstrators could protest outside the no-go zone. “All persons must leave the area immediately. Failure to leave will subject you to arrest. Leave now,” the tweets read. Police have arrested at least 75 people in the past three nights during demonstrations over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck. Eleven adults were arrested during protests Sunday and three juveniles were detained. Earlier Monday, authorities said projectiles — including “large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks” — were thrown at officers and windows in a federal courthouse had been shattered. Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of the demonstrators and said she refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation. “This is a very difficult time for our state and our entire nation. Senseless violence does not honor George Floyd’s death,“ she said, adding later that ”having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants.” Earlier Monday, U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy J. Williams had asked Brown to deploy National Guard troops to the city to guard infrastructure such as federal courthouses and police offices. “What I saw at the Justice Center …. was sickening. This has to stop and in order for that to happen in the city of Portland, we need help,” Williams said of the protests Sunday. “We need bodies, we need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence. This just cannot keep up.” The violence came after thousands of protesters held a largely peaceful demonstration outside the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. At one point, some police officers took a knee with protesters and three people in the crowd had a private talk with Police Chief Jami Resch, authorities said. “We saw people at their very worst and we saw people at their very best,"" said Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis, who thanked protesters who remained peaceful. “Our strategy last night was to make sure that whatever happened, the police bureau was not the cause and so we decided to give them a greater space and give them the time to express themselves.” The Multnomah County GOP criticized the police response in a statement, saying the Portland Police Bureau and Wheeler were being too easy on protesters and should not have allowed them to violate the curfew order without consequences. “After all of Portland’s experience with mass protests, can the police really be so incompetent as to fail to encircle these crowds and arrest them all? Of course not. This is a deliberate policy choice to promoting further disorder,"" said Chairman James Buchal. Elsewhere in Oregon, authorities said between 7,000 and 10,000 people gathered at the federal courthouse in Eugene on Sunday and marched to a local park in a peaceful demonstration. After the event ended, about 1,000 people continued to protest. Some protesters surrounded a car after its driver sprayed something at them and another occupant fired a gun into the ground, angering the crowd, police said. Authorities intervened and no one was injured. In another incident, a man with semi-automatic weapon got out of a Jeep that was parked in the road but a protester was able to keep the crowd back until the man got back into the Jeep and left, said Eugene police spokesman John Hankemeier. The incident is under investigation. In Salem, up to 400 people marched and got into a confrontation with police that resulted in between six to eight arrests.

The demonstration was organized in response to the death of African American man George Floyd, who died last week while in police custody in Minneapolis. Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down during an arrest as police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on the right side of his neck for more than eight minutes, killing Floyd. The incident was caught on video by several bystanders. Chauvin has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and three other officers involved in the arrest have been fired and may also face charges. The event has since prompted substantial public outcry and prompted protests across the nation's cities that have, in multiple cases, devolved into violent and destructive riots. Plans for what was termed a ""Peaceful Black Lives Matter Protest"" in Prineville were first announced on social media early Saturday. According to Prineville Police Chief Dale Cummins, protest organizers met with local law enforcement prior to the demonstration to discuss the event and ensure it would be a carried out peacefully. Once the 5:30 p.m. start time of the protest arrived, 150-200 people had crowded in front of the courthouse. According to Cummins, who spoke to many of the protestors, much of the group was from Central Oregon, though he found less than 10 people from Prineville. The group was led in multiple chants including ""Black lives matter,"" ""George Floyd,"" ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" and ""I can't breathe,"" which Floyd said as he was held down. Across the street, in the Prineville City Hall Plaza, a counter-protest began to emerge. One hoisted sign read ""All lives matter, we are all Americans,"" and other members of the crowd waved American flags. That crowd, which grew to around 100 people as the protest progressed, shouted back at the demonstrators during their chants and occasionally engaged in some chants of their own. When the protestors marched with their signs down to the corner of Third and Main streets, the other group marched in the same direction down the other side of the street. The event drew a lot of attention from motorists passing by the courthouse. Some honked and showed support for the protestors while other drivers cheered the counter-protest. Multiple law enforcement personnel from the Prineville Police Department, Crook County Sheriff's Office and Oregon State Police were interspersed throughout the two crowds while other officials patrolled the city blocks surrounding the event. Once the protest had concluded, about three hours later, it had remained a peaceful event. Cummins said that nobody was injured, and no property damage occurred — in fact, after the demonstration ended, organizers cleaned up the area. He acknowledged that emotions were high and a few flare-ups of pushing and shoving happened, but police quickly broke them up and the people involved listened to authorities and responded in a positive manner. ""I think everything went well,"" he said.",0.0

At 11 p.m. organizers said they were ending the rally at SE 13th and Stark. Anything that may happen after that is not connected with this rally, they said. Shortly before midnight, police say a crowd of about 100 people gathered at Southwest 4th Avenue and Salmon Street. Those protesters began throwing projectiles at police, such as glass bottles and rocks, which injured at least one officer. After an unsuccessful attempt at notifying the protesters that they were required to disperse, PPB said officers used crowd control munitions and began detaining people. The crowd was diffused by 1 a.m. Police say they arrested over a dozen people and seized two guns during this time, but information on those arrests has not yet been released.

They had some ideas about different ways PPB officers cant interact with the community and suggested different people in the community in which to interact with. “They never once mentioned hatred toward the police, they were supportive of the actions that we do honorably,” Resch said. “The majority of our community is supportive of us — for when we do the right thing — and we need to be able to hold ourselves accountable when those of us do not act in a professional manner.” ​",0.0
1623358297,2020-06-02 10:53:35,Mass protests could propel a second wave of coronavirus infections,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/health-news/mass-protests-could-propel-a-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infe.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"AlxeyPnferov/iStockBy ERIN SCHUMAKER, ABC News  (NEW YORK) -- As thousands of demonstrators continue to protest the killing of George Floyd, health experts are worried that a second wave of COVID-19 infections could be sparked by the mass gatherings.  ""What we have here is a very unfortunate experiment going on with COVID virus transmission,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.  While there's lower risk for the virus to be spread outdoors, especially in a moving crowd, many of the weekend's protests culminated in police officers shooting tear gas and using pepper spray and protesters lighting fire to cars and buildings. Smoke, tear gas and pepper spray cause coughing, Osterholm explained, and coughing aerosolizes the virus, increasing the risk that it will spread.  ""If people say, 'well, these are healthy folks,' we know that at least a third of COVID patients are asymptomatic according to the CDC,"" added Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.  Not only are jails crowded indoor spaces, but protesters sat in vehicles at close range for an extended period of time, which increases the risk for onward transmission of the virus, Osterholm explained.  A 1918 a military parade sparked the second wave of flu infections  If history is any indication of how this might play out, we need look no further than the 1918 flu pandemic. In September of that year, after the first wave of spring flu infections subsided, Philadelphia decided to proceed with a military parade, which drew a crowd of 200,000. Within a day, every hospital bed in the city was filled and within six weeks more than 12,000 Philadelphians were dead, according to The Washington Post.  On Monday, mayors and governors urged demonstrators to stay home, and if they do go out, to wear a face mask and maintain social distancing.  ""We don't want people out there where they might catch this disease or spread this disease,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Monday press conference.  ""There's no question there's a danger [that] this could intensify the spread of the coronavirus just at a point when we were starting to beat it back profoundly,"" he said.  How mayors and public health departments are responding  Although government officials have warned demonstrators about the health risks posed by protesting during a pandemic, only a few have offered actionable guidance about the role COVID-19 testing can play in preventing the virus from spreading.  ""If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said during a Sunday new briefing, ""because there's still a pandemic in America that's killing black and brown people at higher numbers.""  Since most people who are infected with coronavirus develop symptoms within 14 days of being infected and can spread the disease days before they feel sick, the window to get tested and avoid infecting others is small.  Getting tested within the next seven days might not be realistic depending on where you live, explained Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, division director of infectious diseases at University of Alabama Medicine.  ""Testing sites are still not set up in our most vulnerable community settings,"" Marrazzo said, pointing to poor and rural areas, particularly in the Deep South.  ""If you are out protesting and return home, you may want to quarantine for a while,"" said Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious disease specialist at South Shore Health. ""You don’t know what you are going to bring home to your parents, grandparents, other members of the family who might have underlying conditions that place them at higher risk.""  New York City's health department stopped short of telling protesters to get tested within a certain timeline, although the department did post to Twitter recommendations for how demonstrators could reduce their risk of spreading COVID-19.  ""Health is our top priority, and with more testing capacity now available, we're inviting anyone who has participated in a demonstration over the past few days to come get tested at one of the more than 150 locations across the city,"" said Patrick Gallahue, a spokesperson for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  The next two weeks are going to give us a better sense about whether case counts will rise, according to Osterholm.  ""Hospitalizations could be 20 days away before you really start seeing that picking up,"" he noted.  Of course, those timelines assume that people who get sick will get tested. They also assume that protests will start to diminish.  Continuing protests ""could take transmission into a whole other week,"" Osterholm said.  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

The Tulsa Race Massacre began on May 21, 1921, and continued into the early morning hours of June 1. What began as a confrontation between groups of white and black residents following the arrest of a young black man ended in the destruction of 35 city blocks in the city's Greenwood District, an affluent area that had become known as ""Black Wall Street,"" home to 1,200 black residents and 300 black-owned businesses.  In addition to the confrontation, many reports on the massacre say the success of the area also fueled the violence. Part of the official report on the massacre reads, ""Many white Tulsans were especially incensed when black Tulsans disregarded, or challenged, Jim Crow practices. Others were both enraged at, and jealous of, the material success of some of Greenwood's leading citizens.""  Newspaper reports following the massacre said only 36 people died, but historians now believe as many 300 people were killed as white mobs destroyed and burned homes, businesses, churches, schools, hospitals and libraries in the predominantly black area.  No one was prosecuted for those deaths or the destruction of property, and, nearly 100 years later, many victims of the massacre have not been identified because their remains have not been found and the event has been allowed to fade from the history books. It was only earlier this year that Oklahoma lawmakers announced a plan to include the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in the curriculums of all state schools.  Rev. Robert Turner, pastor of the Historic Vernon Chapel A.M.E. Church, one of the only buildings from that time that has survived to the present day, said he was surprised to learn of the event only after moving to the city three years ago.  ""My first thought was 'Why is this not known?"" Turner told ABC News. ""Why are we not sharing this with the world?'""  Work is underway to revitalize Tulsa's Greenwood District ahead of the 100th anniversary of the massacre next year, and local leaders hope to mark the historic date with projects and programs that promote entrepreneurship, encourage cultural tourism and educate residents and visitors about an oft-overlooked tragedy.  ""This happened, it's a part of our history,"" Phil Armstrong, project director of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, told ABC News. ""Every other culture has an opportunity to address their past, things that were done to them and how they coped with that, dealt with that and still rose from that.""  The event that sparked the Tulsa Race Massacre is reminiscent of more recent headlines. On May 31, 1921, Dick Rowland, a young black man, was riding in an elevator with a white woman named Sarah Page. Details about what happened in the elevator have never been confirmed, but reports say Page screamed and Rowland ran off. According to official reports on the event, Tulsa Police arrested Rowland the next day.  An article published in the local paper led members of the black community to believe Rowland would be lynched, so a group of black residents went to the courthouse where Rowland was being held, where they were confronted by a group of white residents. Shots were fired, witnesses interviewed in the weeks and months following the event said, but as black residents returned to the Greenwood District, they were followed by white mobs, who opened fire on black residents and began looting and setting fire to buildings. The violence lasted for several days.  The case against Dick Rowland was dismissed in September 1921. According to the official report, no attempt was made to prosecute anyone responsible for the deaths or destruction.  Black families displaced during the massacre lived in tent cities set up by the American Red Cross for months. The recovery process was slow and difficult, but Greenwood residents rebuilt their homes and businesses with almost no help from local, state or federal officials.  Tulsa historian Hannibal B. Johnson says the history of Greenwood is a testament to the spirit of the African Americans who pioneered the community.  ""They suffered through the devastation of 1921 and rebuilt the community to a remarkable level and that's not known generally,"" Johnson told ABC News. ""By 1925, the National Negro Business League had its national meeting here in Tulsa. The peak of this community as a business community was in the early to mid-1940s. There were well over 200 black owned businesses here.""  In 2001, an official Race Riot (as it was then known) Commission was organized to review the details of the event and provide recommendations on providing reparations to survivors and their descendants. The commission's nearly 200-page report outlines the events of the massacre and identifies several victims based on historical reports and firsthand accounts, including several reports of victims being buried in mass graves.  Officials have identified three primary sites that could be the locations of mass graves connected to the 1921 massacre: Oaklawn Cemetery, Newblock Park and Rolling Oaks Memorial Gardens. A test excavation was scheduled to begin at Oaklawn Cemetery on April 1 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A new date for the excavation has not been set.  Current Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum is among local officials supporting a new effort to locate those graves and identify individuals buried in them.  ""As we open this investigation 99 years later, there are both unknowns and truths to uncover,"" Bynum said in a statement. ""We are committed to exploring what happened in 1921 through a collective and transparent process.""  As crowds gathered outside Tulsa's City Hall Monday to protest the death of Floyd, Bynum invited them in to talk about racism and other issues plaguing the city.  In a Facebook post, he wrote, ""99 years ago, our fellow Tulsans lost their lives because white Tulsans opted for violence instead of dialogue with black Tulsans. Today, this generation of Tulsans spent 3 hours in a room working through our differences on a number of important but challenging issues.""  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

""I kind of ignore what President Trump says,"" Pelosi told ABC News' Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on This Week.  ""To take his bait time and time again is just a gift to him, because he always wants to divert attention from what the cause of the response was, rather than to describe it in his own terms,"" she said.  The president on Friday tweeted a message suggesting protesters in Minneapolis could be shot if the demonstrations devolved into looting, which Twitter annotated with a warning that the message glorified violence. He later tweeted that the Secret Service was ready to respond to protesters gathered outside the White House on Friday with ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons.""  Stephanopoulos pressed the speaker about the president's tweets, noting that he has criticized mayors for their response to the protests and blamed antifa and the radical left for encouraging violence.  ""You ignore him, but at the same time, he's been continuing to tweet and speak out. Today, he's attacking the protesters saying it's part of the far left. He's attacking the mayors of Minneapolis and the mayor of Washington, D.C.,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""What should the president of the United States be doing right now?""  ""He should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along,"" Pelosi said, adding that Trump's predecessors brought Americans together during times of unrest, and did not ""fuel the flame.""  When asked whether the arrest of a single officer for third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter is sufficient for justice to be served in response to Floyd's death, Pelosi said she has concerns about whether the charges are severe enough.  ""I said right from the start that it was murder. We saw an execution of a person on TV,"" she said.  ""There are others there who witnessed it, who were -- would be considered, in other circumstances, accomplices to it,"" Pelosi added. ""I have my own concern about a murder-three charge.""  Americans, Pelosi said, ""should be very prayerful about how we can come together to meet the challenges that we face, as our hearts are broken over losing 100,000 Americans -- more than that -- to the coronavirus tragedy.""  ""Let's be prayerful, especially on a Sunday morning, about how we can put our differences aside, because this is the greatest country in the world, and we want to live up to the legacy of America,"" she continued.  Asked how the House would respond to Floyd's death, Pelosi pointed to a new resolution condemning police brutality and racial profiling that calls for policing reforms at the local, state and federal levels authored by Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass, D-Calif.  She also referenced a measure from Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., that would establish a commission to conduct a ""systematic study of the conditions affecting black men and boys.""  A proposal to ban police chokeholds, first introduced by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in 2015, has not moved in the House since Democrats took control of the chamber, but could be considered by the House Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks.  As protests over Floyd's murder continue across the country, Pelosi noted that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is also ""taking undue tolls among people of color.""  ""This is happening at a time of other injustices,"" she said.  Negotiations between the House and Senate over the next round of coronavirus response funding and economic relief are at a standstill, after Democrats passed a $3 trillion measure earlier this month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Friday that the Senate would begin reviewing proposals in ""about a month.""  ""Senator McConnell says we need a pause. Well, the virus isn't taking a pause, the hunger in America isn't taking a pause,"" Pelosi said. ""But they've changed their tune, they're getting closer to (saying) uncle.""

In an appearance on ABC's This Week Sunday, Robert O'Brien echoed statements from Trump and Attorney General William Barr pointing to a militant left-wing group, claiming, ""it's the violent antifa radical militants that are coming out under cover of night, traveling across state lines, using military style tactics to burn down our cities.""  But the administration's own intelligence shows that far-right groups and even white supremacists are also attempting to take advantage of the unrest.

""Everything I've seen … and the reports we're receiving is that this is antifa, they're crossing state lines, and we've seen this happen before,"" O'Brien responded. ""We'll keep our eyes open for anyone else that wants to take advantage of the situation, whether it's domestic or foreign.

Stephanopoulos pointed to a warning to law enforcement this week in which federal authorities flagged incendiary messages sent Wednesday by a racially motivated group that ""incited followers to engage in violence ... by shooting in a crowd.""  ""You said you haven't heard about any other incitement from the right, but the DHS warning that went out this week noted specifically that the white supremacist extremist telegram channel was inciting the violence as well,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""They're saying it is both sides that are inciting violence from the outside.""  Still, O'Brien insisted the images of destruction, violence and vandalism that played out live on television over the weekend were the fault of left-wing extremists.  ""I think the actual perpetrators of the violence, the ones that are on the street that are burning down minority-owned businesses and restaurants who have already suffered through this terrible COVID situation and are at risk of losing their business and now they're seeing them burn to the ground, those are antifa radical militants,"" O'Brien responded.  ""Look, I condemn all extremists on the right or on the left, but the ones who are out on the streets throwing the Molotov cocktails and attacking our police -- who are acting, you know, for the most part with restraint and heroically -- you know, that has to stop,"" he continued.  Stephanopoulos also asked O'Brien about the role the president's rhetoric is playing in stoking unrest across the country, including an inflammatory tweet Friday morning stating, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter flagged the message with an unprecedented advisory stating that it ""violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.""  ""Does the president -- should he be taking responsibility for those tweets, as well?"" asked Stephanopoulos.  ""The reason he uses Twitter is to get directly to the American people -- I think what he said about those tweets is that he wants to deescalate violence and doesn't want people looting,"" O'Brien said, after earlier noting that he was with Trump when the president first viewed the video of Floyd's death and that Trump immediately tweeted a demand for an investigation.  Stephanopoulos later probed O'Brien about the evidence that ""foreign adversaries"" are attempting to exploit the unrest, referring to a tweet by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Saturday in which he said he was ""seeing VERY heavy social media activity on #protests & counter reactions from social media accounts linked to at least 3 foreign adversaries.""  ""Sen. Rubio is spot on. And I've seen a number of tweets from the Chinese today that are taking some sort of pleasure and solace in what they're seeing here,"" O'Brien said.  He also delivered a message about the difference between the U.S. and its adversaries.  ""I want to tell our foreign adversaries, whether it's a Zimbabwe or a China, that the difference between us and you is that that officer who killed George Floyd, he'll be investigated, he'll be prosecuted and he'll receive a fair trial,"" O'Brien said.  ""There's a difference between us and you, and when this happens, we'll get to the bottom of it. We'll clean it up. It's not going to be covered up,"" he added.  When asked whether the officers who witnessed Floyd's arrest and failed to act should also be prosecuted, O'Brien called it ""an absolute outrage.""  ""I can't imagine that they won't be charged. I don't want to pre-judge anything, but what we saw was horrific, and to have stood by and allowed that to happen is, you know, shows a lack of humanity,"" he said. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

1623384906,2020-06-01 11:17:17,Former President Barack Obama puts out guidelines to 'get to work' amid George Floyd protests,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/former-president-barack-obama-puts-out-guidelines-to-get-to.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Mark Makela/Getty ImagesBy ALEXANDRA SVOKOS, ABC News  (WASHINGTON) -- Former President Barack Obama published a piece on Medium on Monday addressing the protests nationwide following the death of George Floyd -- and, specifically, how he thinks people can move forward to ""sustain momentum to bring about real change.""  ""Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe there are some basic lessons to draw from past efforts that are worth remembering.""  His message overall stressed the importance of voting and participating in politics, particularly at the local level, where decisions on ground-level criminal justice and police practices are formed.  The ""bottom line,"" he wrote, is that ""if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn’t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.""  The nation's first and only African American president began by acknowledging that ""the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,"" noting that most people demonstrating have been ""peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring."" He also noted that ""police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood"" that the protesters ""deserve our respect and support.""  He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations.  In his post, Obama requested people ""not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it.""  From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that ""the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.""  He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it's up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best.  ""The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,"" he wrote.  Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic.  ""I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting -- that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"" he wrote. ""But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful.""  He said the next moment in American history can be ""a real turning point"" if ""we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action."" I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 1, 2020 The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, ""to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action.""  This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation's unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd.  ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"" Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. ""It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend.  Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that ""thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd"" and, referencing the military, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet was flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence.""  Trump on Sunday blamed ""ANTIFA"" for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear.

1623384902,2020-06-01 20:17:14,Trump says he is mobilizing 'heavily armed' military to stop protests,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/trump-says-he-is-mobilizing-heavily-armed-military-to-stop-p.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"ABC News(WASHINGTON) -- BY: BEN GITTLESON and JORDYN PHELPS In a dramatic escalation of a national crisis, National Guard troops were deployed near the White House Monday evening hours after President Donald Trump said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country.  Shortly after, Trump came to the White House Rose Garden to call himself the ""law and order"" president, saying ""domestic terrorism"" was to blame for the unrest.  ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property,"" he said. ""We will end it now.""  He called on governors to use their National Guard military police units to ""dominate the streets"" and threatened to deploy the active duty military if governors failed to use the National Guard more forcefully.  He said he may invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which permits a president to deploy military inside the U.S. to deal with civil disorder.  Before Trump spoke, tear gas and flash bangs were used to clear what appeared to be peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and near St. John's Church, which protesters set fire to briefly Sunday night.  Trump and aides then walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to pose before cameras at the church, holding a Bible.  ""We have the greatest country in the world, we're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said, expressing resolve that the country is coming back but did not otherwise engage on reporter questions.  Attorney General Bill Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joined the president for a group photo.  He then began the walk back to the White House after just a minute or so in front of the church, his daughter Ivanka trailing him.  ""What the president did was call out the American military against American citizens,"" New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday just after Trump spoke, ""just so he could have a photo op of him walking to the church.""  ""It was just for photo opportunity. I mean it is it is amazing calling out the American military for a photo opportunity. That's what it was. I mean it was shameful,"" Cuomo told CNN. ""It was really, truly shameful.""  Several truckloads of DC National Guard military police had arrived near Lafayette Park where large groups of protesters had fought with police for the past three nights, at one point on Friday causing officials to have Trump taken to a bunker below the White House for his protection.  A U.S. official said that active duty Army military police units from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were preparing to be on standby in the Washington, D.C. area Monday night after three days of violent protests.  The National Guard troops are going to be protecting national monuments, the White House, property, and infrastructure, the official said.  Not all DC Guard troops will be armed, the official said.  Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Barr were seen walking near the police line in Lafayette Park as military vehicles were stationed nearby.  Mayor Muriel Bowser Monday afternoon declared a curfew beginning at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Tuesday.  The curfew time roughly coincided with the dispersal of the protesters and Trump's walkover to the photo op at the church.  ""During the hours of the curfew, no person, other than persons designated by the Mayor, shall walk, bike, run, loiter, stand, or motor by car or other mode of transport upon any street, alley, park, or other public place within the District,"" the mayor's order said.  Earlier, as the White House geared up for another night of protests outside its gates, President Trump lashed out at governors for their handling of demonstrations over George Floyd's death, emphasizing instances of rioting and looting that marred overwhelmingly peaceful protests across the country.  As his press secretary cited Martin Luther King Jr.'s support for nonviolence, Trump shared a message from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who suggested unleashing a U.S. Army air assault division on those carrying out ""anarchy, rioting, and looting.""  ""100% Correct,"" the president wrote.  Rather than focus on protesters' grievances -- such as systemic racism and police brutality -- Trump has increasingly turned his focus to squelching the civil unrest that has accompanied the national demonstrations and has taken a hardline stance to restoring order.  He has said, without offering evidence, that much of the rioting that has wracked American cities over recent nights has been carried out by supporters of the amorphous ""antifa"" movement -- a loose group of people who define themselves as anti-fascist. He tweeted Sunday that the U.S. would designate the group a terrorist organization, but the White House did not say Monday under what legal authority it would do so, nor did it explain how it could prosecute its members as terrorists.  The president told the nation’s governors on a call Monday that they need to “dominate” over the ongoing situation of unrest and has related the situation to a military conflict.  ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" Trump said, according to a recording of the call obtained by ABC News. ""They're gonna run over you, you're gonna look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.""  He said at another point: ""It is a war in a certain sense and we're gonna end it fast.”  In a surprising statement, the president told the governors he is putting Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley, his top military adviser, “in charge” of the response to the domestic protests. The president did not explain what he meant by putting Milley “in charge.”  Press secretary McEnany did little to clarify the president’s meaning except to tell ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl that the federal government would be deploying “additional federal assets” and that Milley would play a role in a “central command center” to coordinate the responses on the local level.  McEnany also sought to downplay the meaning of the president's call for governors to ""dominate"" the streets, saying the president's interest in calling for greater National Guard activation is not to squelch protests but to allow for them to proceed peacefully.  “When those lines are overwhelmed, law enforcement gets on the defense so what the president has said is he wants to dominate the streets with National Guard, with the police presence and what studies have shown... that when there is an overwhelming National Guard presence it actually deescalates the situation and causes less civil unrest. So Gen Milley has really been on point in talking about the National Guard. The effectiveness and ensuring that they are utilized to great effect across the country,” she said.  Some advisers have pushed the president to deliver an address to the nation about the worst civil unrest Americans have seen in decades. Trump has so far resisted, with no plan for remarks from the Oval Office, the setting for many momentous speeches during times of crises in previous presidencies.  McEnany on Monday pointed to Trump's scripted remarks about Floyd and the protests that he delivered during a trip to Florida for a space shuttle launch. She disputed the notion the president has stayed silent.  ""What I would note is that continual statements, as he has made day and day and day and day again, they don't stop anarchy,"" she told reporters at the White House. ""What stops anarchy is action, and that's what the president is working on right now.""  For three days, peaceful protests like those nationwide have ended yards from the White House, and each night the gatherings have devolved into clashes with police. On Friday, the White House went on lockdown, and the U.S. Secret Service whisked Trump to an underground bunker to shelter in place, according to senior sources familiar with the matter.  The White House has maintained an ""elevated security posture,"" with staffers on Monday discouraged from coming in and advised to hide their badges, according to an email sent to staff Sunday night.  In a series of tweets since late last week, Trump has fanned the flames of division by threatening to sic ""vicious dogs"" on protesters outside the White House -- evoking ugly images of dogs used on African Americans in the 1960a -- and writing, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The latter, made famous by a Miami police chief in the 1960s, was roundly condemned for its racist history.  Few Republicans have spoken out aside from the Senate's lone black Republican, Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who called Trump's tweets ""not constructive.""  ""I do think some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., said Monday. ""It would be helpful if he changed the tone of his message.""  Over the weekend, the entire DC National Guard was called up to assist with maintaining order, and a mix of law enforcement agencies -- among them Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, the Secret Service, and U.S. Park Police -- pushed back protesters near the White House.  Other federal units have joined, as well, including riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons and a Federal Bureau of Investigation hostage rescue team, a senior Department of Justice official said Monday.  Trump on Monday said in his call with the governors said Washington would be ""under much more control"" because ""we're pouring in and we're going to pull in thousands of people.""  ""We're going to clamp down very strongly,"" he said, later adding, ""We're going to do something that people haven't seen before."" He did not elaborate. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

""Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,"" she wrote. ""I've seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can't stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let's focus on peace, prayers & healing.""  While Melania Trump has been absent from public views for days, it's somewhat typical for the private first lady. The New York Times reported she ""opted not to travel to Florida for the rocket launch"" on Saturday amid the nation's unrest.

ABC News confirmed New York Times reporting that President Donald Trump was rushed to an underground bunker at the White House on Friday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, but it is unclear if the first lady and the couple's 14-year-old son, Barron, joined him.  A more public former first lady Michelle Obama shared a string of tweets about Floyd's death on Friday, writing in part, ""Like so many of you, I'm pained by these recent tragedies. And I'm exhausted by a heartbreak that never seems to stop. Right now it's George, Breonna, and Ahmaud. Before that it was Eric, Sandra, and Michael. It just goes on, and on, and on.""

1623384899,2020-06-02 05:37:00,Why DOJ officials say labeling antifa as a terrorist group is 'highly problematic',http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/why-doj-officials-say-labeling-antifa-as-a-terrorist-group-i.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"YinYang/iStockBy MIKE LEVINE, ABC News  (WASHINGTON) -- As fits of violence overshadowed peaceful protesters seeking justice for George Floyd, the black man who died after being kneed on the neck by a Minneapolis police officer, President Donald Trump has claimed that the radical left-wing group antifa is driving the violence.  ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.  Just hours later, Trump's chief spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, vowed on Fox News that -- under a ""law and order"" president like Trump -- antifa ""will be prosecuted as"" a ""domestic terrorism entity.""  But senior officials from within the Justice Department, which would prosecute any such cases, have publicly warned against designating any U.S.-based groups as terrorist organizations, with one senior official telling Congress that such a move would be ""highly problematic.""  ""Both sides of the aisle would share (the concerns),"" Bradley Wiegmann, a top attorney in the Justice Department's National Security Division, told the House Homeland Security Committee during a hearing last year.  In particular, current and former government officials have repeatedly worried that officially designating a U.S.-based group as a terrorist organization could have significant First Amendment consequences.  The First Amendment protects the rights of Americans who like spewing ""hateful speech"" and ""assembling with others who share the same hateful views,"" so ""unless an organization engages solely in unprotected activity, such as committing crimes of violence, any designation of a (U.S.-based) organization as a terrorist organization … would likely run afoul of the First Amendment,"" Mary McCord, the former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, told a House panel in January.  Such free speech concerns aren't implicated when dealing with groups based abroad, such as ISIS or al-Qaida. After all, foreigners outside of the United States are not protected by the First Amendment.  ""Designating domestic groups as 'domestic terrorist organization' and picking out particular groups that you say disagree with their views and so forth is going to be highly problematic, in a way that's not when you're designating al-Qaida or ISIS or an international terrorist organization,"" Wiegmann said last year.  In promising to designate antifa as a terrorist organization and to pursue prosecutions, the Trump administration has not made clear what statutes it might use or how it would actually define an antifa member.  FBI Director Chris Wray underscored the complexities during testimony before Congress last year.  ""For us, antifa (is) more of an ideology than an organization,"" he said. ""We don't think of antifa so much as an organization.""  When it comes to ISIS and other international groups designated as terrorists, U.S. terrorism statutes make it a crime to provide them with ""material support"" -- such as money or even one's own person. That's how so many Americans who fled the United States to join ISIS in Syria or elsewhere were eventually charged and arrested by the FBI.  But no such ""material support"" statute exists for a U.S.-based group.  After last year's deadly assault inside a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, many Democratic lawmakers called for certain white supremacist groups to be designated as domestic terrorist groups. At the time, Justice Department officials explained their concerns.  In many cases, though, federal authorities have used other U.S. laws, including weapons-related charges and hate-crime statutes, to prosecute so-called ""domestic terrorists.""  In a statement Sunday addressing the unrest sparked by Floyd's death in Minneapolis, Attorney General Bill Barr said, ""The violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.""  Barr's statement did not say that antifa would be designated as a domestic terrorism organization.  Nevertheless, antifa followers, white supremacists and other ""domestic terrorists"" can currently face terrorism charges if they use or attempt to use a homemade bomb.  Federal terrorism statutes make it a crime for anyone -- affiliated with a group or not -- to use or attempt to use a weapon of mass destruction, including an explosive device.

1623384897,2020-06-02 06:36:21,Senate Republicans keep mostly quiet on Trump's comments on George Floyd protests,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/senate-republicans-keep-mostly-quiet-on-trumps-comments-on-g.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"drnadig/iStockBy ALLISON PECORIN, ABC News  (WASHINGTON) -- Shortly after several truckloads of D.C. National Guard troops arrived near Lafayette Park, where large groups of protesters had fought with police for the past three nights, President Donald Trump addressed the nation in the Rose Garden, calling for a military show of force against those who are violently protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.  ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property,"" Trump said Monday. ""We will end it now.""  Just as the president concluded his commentary in the Rose Garden on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted a video clip of his earlier floor speech.  ""I have fought for civil rights and the First Amendment. I completely support Americans' rights to peaceably protest and be heard,"" McConnell tweeted. ""Our nation cannot deafen itself to the anger, pain, or frustration of black Americans. Our nation needs to hear this.""  During McConnell's speech on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, he strongly condemned the violence that led to Floyd's death before addressing protesters and saying he hoped that the federal government is prepared to ""stand in the breach"" if state and local authorities are unable to subdue demonstrators.  ""I hope state and local authorities will work quickly to crack down on outside agitators and domestic terrorists and restore some order to our cities,"" McConnell said. ""And if state and local leaders cannot or will not secure the peace and protect citizens and their property I hope the federal government is ready to stand in the breach.""  It is unclear if McConnell was suggesting sending in the military to back up officers. A McConnell aid declined to elaborate when asked for more information about the comment.  But absent in McConnell's remarks was any commentary on the president himself. He has not spoken on the nature of Trump's tweets or his public remarks surrounding Floyd's death and the ensuing protests, marking a pattern among his Republican colleagues of commenting on the protests, but not on the president's rhetoric.  Senate Republicans including Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, have also condemned violence perpetrated by the protesters without mentioning any of the statements made by the president.  Over the weekend, Trump's tweets and comments were increasingly criticized by Democrats and some community leaders who have said Trump's response to the protests, which are occurring in cities across the country, has been damaging and lead to further unrest.  On Friday, Trump tweeted, calling protesters ""THUGS"" and wrote that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" appearing to suggest violence against the demonstrators. The tweet was labeled by Twitter as ""glorifying violence.""  Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued.  ""Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,"" he said.  In the days since, Trump tweeted that if protesters breached the White House fence they would be greeted by ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons.""  Perhaps the most direct Republican response to Trump's comments came Sunday from Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who on Monday night, following the president's remarks in the Rose Garden, said he supported the president's statement.  ""We need to hear more like that from the president because frankly, the country rallies around our chief executive when he speaks about bringing the American family together,"" Scott said. ""So, I thought what he said in the Rose Garden was important, it was powerful, and it was necessary.""  On Sunday, Scott told Fox News' Chris Wallace that the president's tweets were ""not productive"" and said that he spoke with Trump and discussed ""constructive ways to have a dialogue with the nation.""  Scott is the only black Republican serving in the U.S. Senate. This is not the first time he's spoken to Trump following a moment of racial tension in the country -- the two also spoke after protests of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia lead to 28 injuries and one death in 2017.  Scott was one of the first Republicans to comment on Floyd's death, tweeting last week that he believed the Minneapolis police officer involved should be arrested.  One of a few other Republican voices to be critical of Trump's tweets was Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who told reporters that Trump's message could be tweaked.  ""I do think some of his tweets have not been helpful, and it would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message,"" Tooomey said.  And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, tweeted about Trump's tweets on Saturday.  ""What happened to George Floyd is absolutely tragic and we should all demand that those responsible be held accountable so that justice is served. While we are justifiably outraged over Mr. Floyd's death, burning and looting stores and homes is not the answer,"" Murkowski tweeted. ""Nor is the suggestion of further violence. All of us – from local residents and authorities to the President – need to focus on de-escalating the situation in Minneapolis and tackling the issues peaceful protestors are demonstrating about across this country.""  Perhaps the most notably quiet voice on Trump's language is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.  On Monday morning, Graham tweeted in defense of the use of force to subdue protesters who have turned violent.  ""I am confident those responsible for Mr. Floyd's murder will be brought to justice through the Rule of Law,"" Graham tweeted. ""However, it is now time to bring the Rule of Law to bear on the rioters and agitators who are destroying communities and corrupting the tragedy of Mr. Floyd's murder. The lawlessness we see on the streets is not the answer and I fully support the use of federal forces, if necessary, to restore order.""  ABC News reached out to Graham's office on Friday to ask if the senator had any response to Trump's controversial tweet, which was labeled by Twitter as ""glorifying violence,"" but did not receive a response.  In the past, Graham has defended the president for other remarks that have been criticized as being racially insensitive.  In 2019, in the throws of an impeachment investigation, Trump tweeted likening his treatment to that of a ""lynching."" While the tweet received push back from a number of Senate Republicans, including Scott and McConnell, Graham came to the president's defense.  ""This is a lynching in every sense,"" Graham said in October. ""This is un-American.""  Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced Friday that his committee will hold a hearing on police brutality.  ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" the statement says.  Despite Graham's silence on this matter, he did speak out about another racially divisive matter in May by former Vice President Joe Biden.  During an event last month, Biden was met with criticism for telling black voters ""you ain't black"" if they voted for Trump.  Sen. Graham tweeted that the comment was ""truly offensive."" Scott, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also criticized Biden for the remark, which he has since apologized for.  Cruz has also not spoken directly to Trump's tweets, instead criticizing Twitter for placing warning labels on the tweets alongside Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

1623384896,2020-06-02 06:40:39,"Tuesday primaries, amid dual crises, restart election transformed by coronavirus",http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/tuesday-primaries-amid-dual-crises-restart-election-transfor.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"liveslow/iStockBy KENDALL KARSON, ABC News (WASHINGTON) -- In the middle of dual crises confronting the country, voters in eight states and the nation's capital head to the voting booth on Tuesday -- for the single-biggest day of voting since the onset of the coronavirus -- restarting a primary season thrown into disarray after states postponed their contests, and injecting some new energy into a transformed campaign trail.  The presidential primary and down-ballot contests come not only amid the unprecedented circumstances of a pandemic, but as the nation remains gripped by unrest and protests, fueled by anger and frustration over systemic racial issues compounded by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minnesota police officer.  Voters in Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota and the District of Columbia are holding presidential contests, although the primaries for both parties are already settled with two presumptive nominees in former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump. Iowa, the first state in the country to hold a presidential contest with its caucuses on Feb. 3, is set to hold down-ballot primaries for the U.S. Senate and four U.S. House seats, among other lower-profile races.  The voting will be an early preview of how states attempt to run elections if the virus continues to be a risk in the fall.  But the primaries are also taking place against the backdrop of widespread clashes between police and protesters, as some leaders, including those on the frontlines of the protests, are urging Americans to vote to impel meaningful change on racial injustice.  ""If you want change in America, go and register to vote. Show up at the polls on June 9th. Do it in November. That is the change we need in this country,"" Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta and one of the women in contention to be Biden's running mate, said during a Friday night press conference as her city fell into turmoil.  One day before the primaries, former President Barack Obama, in a lengthy Medium post, refuted the suggestion that voting alone is not enough to satisfy a weary electorate's nationwide calls for reform.  ""I’ve heard some suggest that the recurrent problem of racial bias in our criminal justice system proves that only protests and direct action can bring about change, and that voting and participation in electoral politics is a waste of time. I couldn’t disagree more,"" Obama wrote.  ""If we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn’t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform,"" he continued.  The contests also come as the messages from those at the top of the ticket could not be more different.  In the last week, as the president chose to stoke longstanding racial divides rather than trying to comfort a hurting community in a series of tweets, his November rival pushed for unity.  ""We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us,"" Biden said in a statement released over the weekend.  Amid the multiple days of demonstrations in city streets, local election officials are being forced to make some 11th hour adjustments to adapt to the ongoing protests.  In Philadelphia, Gov. Tom Wolf announced on Monday he is extending the deadline for voters to return mail-in ballots by one week, until Tuesday, June 9 in six counties: Allegheny, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Montgomery and Philadelphia.  The move comes after Mayor Jim Kenney said during a press briefing Monday that the city asked for ""the state's assistance in making sure our polling places were secure"" and ""for an extension of the deadline for mail in ballots."" Philadelphia has been under curfew for three straight nights. ""These actions are appropriate and much needed,"" Kenney said.  In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser instituted a curfew through Tuesday night starting at 7 p.m., but clarified that it does not apply to voters, poll workers or election officials and volunteers participating in the election.  In Baltimore, a spokesperson for the city board of elections said they ""cannot"" predict what the protests will look like on election day or what the impact may be, but at least one ballot drop box closed early on Monday and was moved to a different location. The other locations for drop boxes in the city are set to reopen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.  In Iowa, although a spokesperson for Paul Pate, the secretary of state, told ABC News in an email that there are no last-minute changes to adapt to the protests, in an earlier email, the spokesperson noted that county election officials ""are working with local law enforcement"" and ""there are procedures and plans already in place preparing for a variety of scenarios"" without providing specific details.  Voters heading to cast their ballots on Tuesday are also facing an alternate reality due to the coronavirus -- one in which election officials abruptly changed their blueprint for running elections to adjust to social distancing and other state and federal guidelines.  Of the seven states and the nation's capital with primaries for the top of the ticket on June 2, more than half are delayed contests that were initially scheduled in April and May -- reflecting the volatility brought on by the coronavirus.  All of the states holding elections are relying on and expanding their vote-by-mail apparatus to adapt to the shifting public health conditions, even as Trump attempts to cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in voting.  Before the pandemic, six of the states holding presidential contests allowed for no-excuse absentee voting. In late March, Indiana's elections board ordered the expansion of access to absentee mail-in voting to all voters in the Hoosier state -- without requiring an excuse. Election officials have spent weeks and months preparing for the one day of contests -- second only to Super Tuesday -- which look far different from only a few months ago.  In interviews with election officials across the country, most moved quickly to prepare their staff and voters for the changes that the coronavirus placed on voting. Some states, like Rhode Island and Montana, have instituted changes to their voting system in recent years which have widely expanded vote-by-mail procedures. Others, like Pennsylvania and Indiana, are working around the clock to prepare voters and elections officials for the massive influx of absentee ballot requests.  Across geographies and party lines, secretaries of states, local election boards and candidates themselves have given a strong endorsement of the absentee voting process, encouraging voters to request their ballots through applications in states which require them.  But the contests, and the massive mail-in vote effort across each of the states, could serve as a harbinger for what is potentially ahead in the fall if the coronavirus outbreak persists.  In South Dakota, an upper Midwest state that saw the highest number of COVID-19 cases per capita for the region in mid-April but currently has one of the lowest fatality rates in the country, election officials are confident the Tuesday primaries will run smoothly.  ""Since we didn't change the laws, we're just utilizing some of the tools we already have,"" said Steve Barnett, the Republican secretary of state in South Dakota. ""A lot of people are taking advantage of absentee voting.""  But in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania where there will be only 190 in-person polling places this election, a dramatic decrease from the 831 in last November's municipal election, Commissioner Lisa Deeley told ABC News she is ""extremely worried"" over the influx of absentee ballots just for the primary, which only portends concerns expected in November when turnout is far higher.  ""The numbers that we've seen this primary are pretty incredible and we know that there's much more activity in the general election,"" she said, adding that after Tuesday's election is over, local election officials will be convening a working group to figure out a plan for processing returned ballots for the general election.  ""We all hope, as everybody does, that we’re somewhat back to normal by November, but to risk that we're not, it would really create an issue for us. We could see 400,000 to 500,000 applications in an election like that,"" she said.  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0
1623384895,2020-06-02 06:50:00,"Police used tear gas, pushed back peaceful protesters for Trump church visit",http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/police-used-tear-gas-pushed-back-peaceful-protesters-for-tru.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesBy BEN GITTLESON and JORDYN PHELPS, ABC News (WASHINGTON) -- Police reinforced by National Guard troops forcefully pushed back protesters outside the White House Monday evening to clear a way for President Donald Trump to visit a church, just minutes after he said he wanted a military show of force against violent protests gripping the country.  As television cameras showed live images of Trump's quick stop at the historic St. John's Church, where a small fire caused damage to its basement during protests the night before, the president posed with a Bible and with senior members of administration. Moments before, police had cleared largely peaceful demonstrators from the area, using tear gas and beating some with batons and shields, including at least one news photographer.  The dramatic escalation, 15 minutes before a nighttime curfew was due to go into effect, came soon after D.C. National Guard troops were deployed near the White House.  As the protesters were being cleared from the area, Trump came to the White House Rose Garden to call himself the ""law and order"" president, saying ""domestic terrorism"" was to blame for the unrest.  ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,"" he said. ""We will end it now.""  He called on governors to use their National Guard military police units to ""dominate the streets"" and threatened to deploy the active duty military if governors failed to use the National Guard more forcefully.  He said he may invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which permits a president to deploy military inside the U.S. to deal with civil disorder.  Following his remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump and his aides walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to pose before cameras at the church, holding a Bible.  ""We have the greatest country in the world, we're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said, expressing resolve that the country is coming back but did not otherwise engage in reporter questions.  Attorney General Bill Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joined the president for a group photo.  He then began the walk back to the White House after just a minute or so in front of the church, his daughter Ivanka trailing him.  Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde issued a response to the president's visit to the church: ""The President just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for. To do so, he sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard. I am outraged."" In a tweet, Arlington County Board Member Libby Garvey said that officers from the northern Virginia city were recalled from Washington.  ""Appalled mutual aid agreement abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op,"" she wrote.  Contacted by ABC News, Garvey said about 40 Arlington police officers had been in Washington as part of a mutual aid agreement with the U.S. Park Police serving as backup to help keep people safe.  In a statement Monday, the Arlington County Board said, ""At the direction of the County Board, County Manager and Police Chief, all ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 tonight. The County is re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.""  New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday just after Trump spoke, ""What the president did was call out the American military against American citizens, just so he could have a photo op of him walking to the church.""  ""It was just for photo opportunity. I mean it is it is amazing calling out the American military for a photo opportunity. That's what it was. I mean it was shameful,"" Cuomo told CNN. ""It was really, truly shameful.""  A White House spokesman said in a statement that law enforcement forces pushed people in order to enforce Washington's 7 p.m. curfew.  ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the city's 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before,"" Judd Deere, a White House deputy press secretary, said. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police.""  But most protesters were largely peaceful, and law enforcement began moving on them 15 minutes before the curfew even started, according to ABC News' Rachel Scott. Minutes earlier, Trump had declared himself an ""ally"" of peaceful protesters.  ""I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he said in the Rose Garden.  Several truckloads of D.C. National Guard military police had arrived near Lafayette Park Monday evening where large groups of protesters had fought with police for the past three nights. At one point on Friday, the protests prompted officials to have Trump taken to a bunker below the White House for his protection.  Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Barr were seen walking near the police line in Lafayette Park as military vehicles were stationed nearby.  A U.S. official said that active duty Army military police units from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were preparing to be on standby in the Washington, D.C. area Monday night.  The National Guard troops are going to be protecting national monuments, the White House, property and infrastructure, the official said, and not all D.C. Guard troops will be armed.  Earlier, as the White House geared up for another night of protests outside its gates, Trump lashed out at governors for their handling of demonstrations over George Floyd's death, emphasizing instances of rioting and looting that marred overwhelmingly peaceful protests across the country.  As his press secretary cited Martin Luther King Jr.'s support for nonviolence, Trump shared a message from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who suggested unleashing a U.S. Army air assault division on those carrying out ""anarchy, rioting, and looting.""  ""100% Correct,"" the president wrote.  Rather than focus on protesters' grievances -- such as systemic racism and police brutality -- Trump has increasingly turned his focus to squelching the civil unrest that has accompanied the national demonstrations and has taken a hardline stance to restoring order.  He has said, without offering evidence, that much of the rioting that has wracked American cities over recent nights has been carried out by supporters of the amorphous ""antifa"" movement -- a loose group of people who define themselves as anti-fascist. He tweeted Sunday that the U.S. would designate the group a terrorist organization, but the White House did not say Monday under what legal authority it would do so, nor did it explain how it could prosecute its members as terrorists.  The president told the nation's governors on a call Monday that they need to ""dominate"" over the ongoing situation of unrest and has related the situation to a military conflict.  ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" Trump said, according to a recording of the call obtained by ABC News. ""They're gonna run over you, you're gonna look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.""  He said at another point: ""It is a war in a certain sense and we're gonna end it fast.""  In a surprising statement, the president told the governors he was putting Milley, his top military adviser, ""in charge"" of the response to the domestic protests. The president did not explain what he meant by putting Milley ""in charge.""  McEnany did little to clarify the president's meaning except to tell ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl that the federal government would be deploying ""additional federal assets"" and that Milley would play a role in a ""central command center"" to coordinate the responses on the local level.  McEnany also sought to downplay the meaning of the president's call for governors to ""dominate"" the streets, saying the president's interest in calling for greater National Guard activation is not to squelch protests but to allow for them to proceed peacefully.  ""When those lines are overwhelmed, law enforcement gets on the defense so what the president has said is he wants to dominate the streets with National Guard, with the police presence and what studies have shown ... that when there is an overwhelming National Guard presence it actually deescalates the situation and causes less civil unrest. So Gen. Milley has really been on point in talking about the National Guard. The effectiveness and ensuring that they are utilized to great effect across the country,"" she said.  The White House has maintained an ""elevated security posture,"" with staffers on Monday discouraged from coming in and advised to hide their badges, according to an email sent to staff Sunday night.  In a series of tweets since late last week, Trump has fanned the flames of division by threatening to sic ""vicious dogs"" on protesters outside the White House -- evoking ugly images of dogs used on African Americans in the 1960s -- and writing, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The latter, made famous by a Miami police chief in the 1960s, was roundly condemned for its racist history.  Over the weekend, the entire DC National Guard was called up to assist with maintaining order, and a mix of law enforcement agencies -- among them Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, the Secret Service, and U.S. Park Police -- pushed back protesters near the White House.  Other federal units have joined, as well, including riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons and a Federal Bureau of Investigation hostage rescue team, a senior Department of Justice official said Monday.  Trump on Monday said in his call with the governors that Washington would be ""under much more control"" because ""we're pouring in and we're going to pull in thousands of people.""  ""We're going to clamp down very strongly,"" he said, later adding, ""We're going to do something that people haven't seen before.""  He did not elaborate. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation,” Biden said.  Biden, who held his first in-person campaign event in over two months Monday in Wilmington, Delaware, hearing from members of the African American community about their priorities in the wake of Floyd’s death, also emphasized that the protests, coupled with the disproportionate impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on minority communities, highlight the need to address systemic racial injustices.  “They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment -- with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities,” he said.  The Democrat took direct aim at President Trump, following a night defined by the decision to use tear gas to push back peaceful protestors near the White House so that Trump could walk to the historic St. John’s Church nearby and pose with a Bible alongside senior members of administration.  “When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden said.  ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care,” Biden added. “For that’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us.”  “The president held up the Bible at St John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while. Instead of brandishing it. If he opened it he could have learned something. They're all called to love one another as we love ourselves, it's really hard work. But it's the work of America,” Biden said, adding that Trump has “no interest” in doing that work.  “In addition to the Bible, the president might also want to open the U.S. Constitution once in a while. If he did he'd find a thing called the First Amendment. And what it says, in the beginning, it says: 'The right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential notion built into this country. Mr. President, that's America. That's America,” Biden added.  He said that while no person can promise to be a perfect president, the former vice president pledged to try to unite the country and “heal the racial wounds.”  ""I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,"" Biden said. ""I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me. It’s about you. And I’ll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was.""  The focus on President Trump’s exploitation of division has long been a focus for Biden in his presidential campaign, launching his run with a video that focused on the events of Charlottesville in 2017 as the catalyst prompting his third run for the White House.  “That’s when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world, and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were 'very fine people on both sides.' Very fine people on both sides?” Biden said in the April 2019 video launching his campaign.  ""With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had seen in my lifetime,” Biden continued.  During a roundtable on Monday with mayors from major American cities, Biden described the widespread protests as a manifestation of “justifiable” anger, but urged those protestors to refrain from violence and looting, which he argues overshadows their main message.  “We need that anger. We need that to tell us to move forward. It helps us push through this pain and reach the other side to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion,” Biden said. “But we're also seeing a justifiable public outrage and protests turned to acts of needless destruction in cities across the country, which are not justified.”  “I think we all agree that the act of protesting should never be overshadowed by the reason we're protesting. It shouldn't drive people away from a just cause that a protest is meant to advance, but violence is endangers lives, it guts local businesses, it is no way forward,” he added, speaking with the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul.

'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said.

1623402444,2020-06-02 10:25:34,Pelosi to Trump: Be a 'healer in chief',https://www.registerguard.com/ZZ/news/20200602/pelosi-to-trump-be-healer-in-chief?rssfeed=true,en,True,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday urged President Donald Trump to be a 'healer in chief' while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged 'racism in America' as the wrenching debate fueling protests over the treatment of black people in the United States arrived in Congress. Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reeforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose.

Kate Brown for what he called the ""mischaracterization"" of his request for National Guard troops. Wheeler spoke at a Tuesday, June 2, press conference. Wheeler said that the vast majority of Monday night's protesters were peaceful, he is hopeful the curfew — which was in effect Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights — will not be needed again. Although a small group of demonstrators clashed with police early Tuesday after most protesters had left downtown, the damage appeared less than on previous nights. Wheeler also accused Brown of misrepresenting his request for National Guard troops to support weary local first responders, including police. Wheeler publicly made the request Monday morning, asking for troops who would be used to protect facilities, freeing up officers for crowd management. He said, on Monday, that he previously had asked for the troops and Brown had declined to send them. Speaking at her own press conference later on Monday, Brown authorized 50 troops to be deployed in Portland, but in a support capacity and unarmed. She implied that Wheeler had asked for the troops to be put on the front lines. ""Our goal, and the goal of the overwhelming number of protesters, is to reduce violence,"" Brown said at her press event, at which Wheeler was not present but City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty was. ""You don't reduce violence by putting soldiers on the streets,"" Brown said. ""Soldiers on the streets across America is what President Trump wants. He has made that clear this morning (in a conference call) with governors across the United States. Trump wants the governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force,"" Brown continued. Wheeler, on Tuesday, said he had always been clear the troops would not be put on the front lines. ""I was alarmed last night by the governor's mischaracterization of the city's request for the national guard,"" he said. ""I have said from the beginning that I stood in solidarity for our demonstrators fighting for justice and for reform — I stand with them. The National Guard were requested by me and the bureau for protecting buildings, not to be on the front lines directly engaging with demonstrators, that was never the case."" Wheeler said he'd requested the troops because of the long hours put in by police over the weekend. ""We've been relying on our regional and local law enforcement partners for several days now. They're exhausted. No matter how well-trained somebody is, exhaustion can take a toll on clear decision making. So when the governor said I requested that the National Guard be deployed in direct confrontation with protesters, I called her and we had a conversation about mischaracterization,"" Wheeler continued. Wheeler said several people were on his phone calls with Brown who could confirm the nature of his request. Portland Police Chief Jami Resch said she was always clear that the troops would be used to protect property, not deal with protesters. At the Tuesday press conference, Hardesty appeared to back Brown's interpretation of the request. Hardesty said she initially opposed bringing the troops to Portland, but changed her mind when it was agreed they would serve in a support capacity and would not be armed. ""We are not entering martial law,"" Hardesty said at Brown's press conference. ""We are not going to have armed people on every corner in the city of Portland."" Joining Brown and Hardesty at the Tuesday press conference were State Sen. Lew Fredricks of Portland, State Rep. Janelle Bynum of Happy Valley and Oregon State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton. Brown also called for Wheeler to rebuild collaborative relationship with other cities in the area. Some have pulled out of protest-related mutual aid agreements in the past year due to their concerns about added liability exposure. Multiple agencies currently are assisting Portland, including the Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. KOIN News 6 contributed to this story.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that Canadians are watching what’s unfolding in the United States with “horror and consternation” and he paused for 21 seconds when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump and the use of tear gas against protesters to clear the way for a photo opportunity. Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. “We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,” he said. “It is time to pull people together.” Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John’s Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn’t mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn’t comment about Trump’s actions. “Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,” he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. “Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn’t mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,” Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn’t be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.” He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

Demonstrations across the country have turned violent and deadly for U.S. police officers who find themselves walking a delicate balance between protecting protesters' First Amendment rights and guarding property from being looted and destroyed.  A police officer was shot and critically wounded in Las Vegas Monday night when a peaceful demonstration turned violent, authorities said. The officer, whose name was not immediately released, was engaging with protesters near the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino when the shooting occurred, officials said. In a second incident in Las Vegas, police shot a suspect they alleged was wielding multiple weapons outside a courthouse. The man was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  In St. Louis, four officers were shot and wounded during a protest that drew several thousand people and turned into a free-for-all in which fireworks and gas were hurled at police and mobs began looting businesses, officials said.  In New York City, video emerged of an officer being attacked by a group of men in the Bronx who appeared to throw a heavy object at the officer while he was on the ground. Several officers were struck by cars Monday night and there was widespread looting and vandalism across the city, including at luxury stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD). At least 500 arrests were made Monday night and into Tuesday morning in New York, where a curfew went into effect at 11 p.m. Monday.  On Friday night, Dave Patrick Underwood, a Federal Protective Service contract officer, was shot and killed at the federal building in Oakland, California. Underwood was slain while on duty and the FBI says shots were fired by an unidentified person in a vehicle. Authorities are investigating whether it was tied to a protest.  “This is what we’re looking at right now. It’s a tough place to be in right now,"" Robert Boyce, the retired chief of detectives of the NYPD and an ABC News contributor, said of police on the front lines of American discord.  Eddie Johnson, the former Chicago police superintendent, added that police are juggling two volatile situations: legitimate protesters venting their anger in a peaceful way and violent agitators bent on destruction.  ""That’s unfortunate because it takes away from the real message of how police interact with people in general, especially people of color, African Americans,"" Johnson told ABC News. ""It’s completely taken away from that message and now all the focus is on violence and it’s a shame.""  Nearly 800 people were arrested in Chicago during protests over the weekend when groups split off from demonstrations and began looting and vandalizing businesses, police said.  On Monday afternoon, President Donald Trump, who critics say has fueled some of the violence with inflammatory tweets suggesting protesters could be shot for looting, said he has seen enough and threatened to use the military to quell the violence. In a White House Rose Garden speech, with protesters assembled right outside the gates, Trump implored governors across the nation to boost the presence of National Guard troops in cities to ""dominate the streets.""  ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,"" he said. ""We will end it now.""  The president said he is ""ally of all peaceful protesters"" while at the same time the National Guard and police were using force to disperse a peaceful protest outside the White House gates so Trump could cross the street to a vandalized St. John's Episcopal Church to be photographed holding a Bible.  Jarrod Burguan, the former police chief of San Bernardino, California, and an ABC News contributor, said police commanders nationwide are weighing how much leeway to give legitimate protesters. But when conditions deteriorate, decisions have to be made to protect lives and property, he said.  ""When things turn violent and when things have reached kind of the point that we are at now, you realize that the only way to really, truly put it down is to truly respond with force and find a way to stop the looting and stop the violence that's happening,"" Burguan said in an interview on the ABC News podcast ""Start Here.""  Caught on video  But in some cases, police officers trying to keep a lid on rising tensions while allowing peaceful protests to go on have been caught on camera seemingly committing the very acts people are protesting against.  In Seattle, a video surfaced over the weekend showing a police officer with his knee on the neck of a pinned protester, an act that was similar to circumstances surrounding Floyd's May 25 death. Protesters screamed for the officer to remove his knee until a colleague pushed it away. The incident is under investigation.  In Atlanta, two police officers were fired and three others were yanked off the streets and placed on desk duty after they were caught on video deploying stun guns on two black college students who were in a car simply driving home from a protest, authorities said.  In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a police officer was suspended after a video showed him pushing a kneeling black woman to the ground during protests.  In New York, police officers are under investigation after video footage surfaced of them using their vans to ram a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn after demonstrators hurled projectiles at their vehicles and used a metal barricade to block their path. In a separate incident, a New York City police officer is now the subject of an internal investigation after he was recorded on video aggressively shoving a female protester to the ground for apparently getting too close to him.  ""One of your biggest fears is that it only takes one officer on that front line to lose his cool because ... he's got people yelling at him,"" Burguan said. ""Maybe you got a water bottle thrown at him whatever it might be. It just takes one officer to lose their cool and pull out their pepper spray or start poking people with their baton or start doing things that are gonna agitate the crowd that's going to make your job infinitely more difficult. And I guarantee you that there are chiefs all over the country that are going to evaluate the actions of their specific officers and how things went down. And there's going to be that due process [in] those investigations that happen on the backside.""  Not only do officers assigned to skirmish lines have to deal with protesters screaming obscenities in their faces, they also have to cope with agitators who infiltrate legitimate demonstrations in order to wreak havoc and career criminals bent on looting businesses, Boyce said.  ""To be quite honest with you, these anarchists are very well organized, they’re anti-everything -- anti-religion, anti-capitalism, anti-globalism, you name it they’re anti,"" he continued. ""They want a complete breakdown of structure and that’s what we’re kind of going through right now.""  'Professional agitator'  Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, identified one of three protesters arrested on suspicion of tossing Molotov cocktails at NYPD vehicles as someone known to police across the county as a ""professional agitator."" Prosecutors, according to court records, say Samantha Shader has previously been arrested 11 times in 11 different states since 2011 for allegedly committing acts of violence and resisting arrest.  Shrader was charged with federal crimes of causing damage by fire and explosives to police vehicles. She has not yet entered a plea and remains in federal custody.  Two other suspects charged in the firebombings of police vehicles, Colinford Mattis and Urooj Rahma, are licensed attorneys who have attended prestigious universities and law schools, according to court records. They, too, were charged with federal crimes of causing damage by fire and explosives to police vehicles, but have yet to enter a plea and remain in federal custody.  “As such, the defendants were well aware of the severity of their criminal conduct when they decided to hurl a Molotov cocktail at an NYPD vehicle and to incite others to do the same,"" federal prosecutors said in court documents.  Shader was photographed in a car holding what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail at the scene of one of the New York firebombings, authorities said.  “The defendant’s criminal conduct was extraordinarily serious,” prosecutors alleged of Shader in court papers. “She hurled a Molotov cocktail at an NYPD vehicle with emergency lights on and occupied by four police officers, causing damage to the vehicle and putting the officers’ lives in serious danger.”  Boyce, who retired from the NYPD in 2017 after a 35-year career with the department, said on Friday night alone 47 police vehicles were torched and 30 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent.  He said that while he empathizes with protesters seeking justice for Floyd's killing, he added that the demonstrations are drawing a more nefarious element and police officers are often caught in the middle and often goaded into ambushes or provoked into aggressive behavior that gets caught on viral videos.  He said roving bands of well-organized anarchists have been stockpiling bricks, bottles and gasoline bombs in areas where they know protests will occur and then striking at the optimum moment, usually when news media is on hand to witness their actions.  ""You have Molotov cocktails, you have bricks and bottles being thrown at police officers,"" Boyce said. “These are riots right now. This has been completely hijacked.""  U.S. Attorney General William Barr used similar language on Saturday to describe the chaos on the streets of American cities in the wake of the Floyd killing.  “The voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,” Barr said in a televised statement at the Department of Justice.  “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda. In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom traveled from outside the state to promote the violence,” Barr said.  Chemical attacks  The Homeland Security Bureau Southeast Florida issued a bulletin on Sunday to federal and state authorities in South Florida listing the incidents in which police officers have been attacked with unknown chemicals during protests over the weekend. In Philadelphia on Saturday, police officers reported sustaining chemical burns during protests, according to the agency, while in Miami people were spotted mixing chemicals in water bottles during a demonstration there. In Fort Lauderdale, dozens of people pelted police with plastic bottles containing unknown fluid, the agency reported.  ""After the Molotov cocktail attack Friday night, law enforcement remains concerned that protests could give cover to 'agitators' looking to use chemicals or gasoline to injure police,"" according to the bulletin obtained by ABC News.  “I think that people forget, citizens forget these cops are human too and they don’t get paid to get spit on, get bricks thrown at them and the new thing of the day is to throw water bottles at them,"" Johnson said. ""Now that water bottle could contain water or various other things. They don’t get paid to be punching bags out there. But the majority of the cops do a really good job at showing restraint.""  Johnson said that during his 31 years in law enforcement, he has encountered groups of anarchists crossing state lines to cause trouble in Chicago.  ""They would come from out of town with the one thought of agitating police and what they do is they bait police into doing something or being overly aggressive then they sue,"" Johnson said. ""And they use that money to continue traveling around the country and causing headaches everywhere they go. So we do have professional people who travel around the country and do nothing but stir up these incidents.""  He said he is encouraged to see instances across the country in which legitimate protesters have called out agitators in the act of causing disturbances.  “The real protesters who are trying to change things, they don't want that message getting clouded with agitators out there just to create chaos,"" Johnson said. ""Our real protesters aren’t trying to clash with the police. They’re trying to get a message out there and they don’t want that message to get conflated with violence.""  Johnson noted that many U.S. officers on the front lines of the protests are black and face additional dynamics of weighing their own experience with racism in law enforcement agencies and doing their jobs and watching the backs of their colleagues.  “If you saw that video of George Floyd's life being snuff out and you think that’s OK and you're a cop then you need to turn in your badge right away because there’s nothing that I saw that was right about that,"" said Johnson, who is African American. ""Now having said that, I understand people protesting so vigorously because we do have to have change, we do have to create a culture that everybody is looked at equally, not just treated equally, but looked at equally. And their lives have the same value that anybody else lives have. So I empathize with that.""  The Major Cities Chiefs Association, an organization comprised of police chiefs from the nation's largest cities, released a letter to its members on Monday, saying, ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now.""  ""The death of George Floyd was, by any measure of professional policing unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the letter says.  The letter referred to other notable cases in which black lives have been ""unjustly lost"" to the hands of police, including Eric Garner in New York in 2014, Walter Scott in South Carolina in 2015 and Philando Castile in Minnesota in 2016.  ""Each of these cases raised different concerns, but collectively they add new and painful chapters to our history that compels all of us to take inventory and be held accountable,"" the letter says.  ""It will take strong leadership from all of us as well as collaborative partnerships from leaders from all walks of life and all levels,"" the letter continues. ""Actions matter and so do words. Provocative statements create tension that lead to danger for police officers and the public. During challenging times, leaders need to reassure and calm, not instigate and stoke discord. Let us be the example for all leaders to follow. More than anything, this is a time for us to help facilitate healing, learning, listening and then dialogue, particularly in communities of color.""

1623499230,2020-06-02 13:12:23,Trump praises 'overwhelming force' and 'domination' in DC morning after peaceful protest broken up for photo op,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/trump-praises-overwhelming-force-and-domination-in-dc-mornin.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"Official White House Photo by Joyce N. BoghosianBy JORDYN PHELPS and BEN GITTLESON, ABC News (WASHINGTON) -- It was a made-for-TV moment.  President Donald Trump, Bible in hand, posing in front of the historic St. John’s Church a block from the White House Monday night, the day after the church’s basement apparently was set on fire by protesters.  It came at a cost.  Demonstrators who had been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting the death of George Floyd and racial injustice in policing were pushed back, forcibly, with the use of flash-bangs and tear gas to make way for the president.  But the morning after the photo-op, which has been roundly criticized, Trump found no cause for regret as he posted on Twitter with his praise for the night’s events, that included the presence of hundreds of law enforcement and National Guardsmen in front of the White House.  ""D.C. had no problems last night,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination.”  The president directly congratulated himself for what was a quieter evening than those over the weekend in both the nation’s capital and Minneapolis, writing: “Thank you President Trump!”  But even as the president congratulated himself, many others found cause for condemnation.  The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington said she was “outraged” by the president’s use of the historic episcopal church as a backdrop after breaking up the peaceful demonstration.  The Rev. Mariann Budde, the diocesan bishop who oversees St. John's Church, said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that the president's photo-op was ""as if it were spiritual validation and justification for a message that is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and to the God of justice.""  “That is not, quote, her church, that is not, quote, her Bible,” Counselor to the President KellyAnne Conway said in an interview with Fox News Tuesday. “We don’t look into other people’s hearts and souls and discern and judge what their faith is, why the president felt compelled to walk there, why he held that Bible up.”  Defending the president’s church photo op, she said, “that is a symbol to everyone that we will not allow arsonists and anarchists who set that fire ablaze … we won’t let them to dissuade us from practicing our religion.”  Trump on Tuesday morning also visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington to lay a wreath in honor of the former Pope's 100th birthday and later was to sign an executive order the White House said would ""advance international religious freedom.""  Just before he arrived, the Catholic Archbishop of Washington, Wilton D. Gregory, the nation's most senior African American bishop, issued a blistering statement along the same lines as his Episcopal counterpart, saying the Shrine, which he does not oversee, was also being ""misused"" by Trump.  ""I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,"" Gregory said.  ""Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace,"" he said.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday also condemned the night's event, expressing dismay that police ""came out and beat"" protesters to clear the way for the president.  ""What is that? That has no place and it's time for us to do away with that,"" said Pelosi.  Noting how Trump, as he stood in front of St. John's Church, held up a Bible, held up her own copy of the Bible in front of cameras and read several passages from the book of Ecclesiastes calling for healing.  Pelosi said President Trump ""has the responsibility to heal"" and used the moment to highlight the stark contrast between Trump's own words about the national protests vs what the presidents before him have said.  ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents before him and be a healer-in-chief, and not a fanner of the flame,"" Pelosi said. After police used tear gas and pushed back peaceful protesters for Trump’s church visit, Pelosi reads from the Bible.  “A time to heal, the book of Ecclesiastes,” she says, adding she hopes Trump will be “healer in chief and not a fanner of the flames.” https://t.co/EaAcLoZpUA pic.twitter.com/G6S5jiFcjm — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) June 2, 2020 Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

What a wild four days we've had, huh? Here are the headlines. • Last night saw a fourth night of protests agains police violence and the killing of George Floyd throughout Portland. It was the most peaceful night we've seen so far—both from protestors and the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). You can check out our live updates from the night here. Funny how you don’t need riot gear to have a perfect evening. Guess we didn’t need the National Guard after all. pic.twitter.com/KeWepEjvhv — Wm. Steven Humphrey (@WmSteveHumphrey) June 2, 2020 • The hours leading up to those protests, however, were decidedly less chill. PPB blocked off 16 blocks in the city's downtown core, and Gov. Kate Brown announced she would send National Guard troops and Oregon State Troopers to provide backup for PPB. They didn't make a public appearance last night, however. • Mayor Ted Wheeler is holding a press conference about the protests as I type this. You can watch the full video here—and here are some first impressions from OPB reporter Rebecca Ellis: Said Gov. Brown mischaracterized his request for the national guard.  “The national guard was never requested for direct confrontation with protesters.”  Says they were meant to relieve first-responders for protecting buildings, never for being on the frontlines. — Rebecca Ellis (@Rjaellis) June 2, 2020 • Oh, and don't think we've forgotten our dear old dictator! Yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump threatened state governors, saying if they don't send out the National Guard to quell protesters (who he calls ""domestic terrorists""), he would send in the military to do their job for them. He also tear-gassed protestors outside the White House so he could make that very important announcement from the White House lawn. • As protests continue, TriMet service and infrastructure continues to be impacted. • Don't think Portland is the only Oregon city showing up for the cause. Last night also saw demonstrations in Eugene, Salem, and... Hermiston? Go off, Hermiston! The crowd at the Black Lives Matter protest in Hermiston is growing by the minute with more than 50 people now spread throughout the intersection. A lot of drivers honking and raising a fist in solidarity but someone also just yelled the n word at them. pic.twitter.com/FKq0VCGOE7 — Jade McDowell (@jademc07) June 1, 2020 • Oh, wait, there's still a pandemic happening, right? That fact is weighing heavy on the minds of some local leaders, even as they recognize the need to protest. ""After three nights of thousands of people side by side protesting, I am very concerned that COVID-19 will be exacerbated in Multnomah County and it will be exacerbated, because we know that Black and brown people suffer three times harsher outcomes with COVID-19 than the white population,” Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said at a press conference yesterday. • Speaking of COVID-19: A new poll shows that seven in 10 Americans say they would ""likely"" get a vaccine when one becomes available.

1623506574,2020-06-02 09:00:00,Protests Force Leaders To Weigh Coronavirus Spread Against The Right To Political Expression,https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-portland-spike-coronavirus-right-to-gather/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"As thousands take to the streets to protest police brutality and demand justice for the killing of Black people in America, Oregon leaders are expressing concern that such mass gatherings could hasten the spread of the coronavirus — something that’s already taken a disproportionate toll on communities of color. Since late last week, tens of thousands of people have been gathering each evening in cities across the United States — most to express their outrage and demand justice and reforms following the killing of George Floyd. The Minneapolis man, who was African American, died May 25 after a white police officer planted his knee on Floyd’s neck, pinning him down for nearly nine minutes. The protests stretched into a fourth day in Portland on Monday. Thousands of demonstrators have taken part in events there, as well as in Salem, and Eugene. Many have worn protective face masks, but social distancing hasn’t been practiced. By Monday, Oregon state officials began to voice their concerns that the coronavirus may begin to spread once again and continue to affect Black and Brown communities whose members are on the frontlines of the protests and who are already disproportionately affected by the pandemic. During a press conference, Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said she understands the need and the reason to take to the streets and protest, but she fears for the safety and well being of the community. “After three nights of thousands of people side by side protesting, I am very concerned that COVID-19 will be exacerbated in Multnomah County and it will be exacerbated because we know that Black and Brown people suffer three times harsher outcomes with COVID-19 than the white population,” Hardesty said on Monday afternoon before Portland’s fourth day of protests were fully underway. Hardesty asked people to be mindful while protesting and if they can, to stay home and be with their families instead. “Yes, civil rights are important, racial justice is necessary, but we have to live in order to be able to change the systems that have been oppressing Black people since we got here,” Hardesty said. Gov. Kate Brown expressed similar sentiments but said she also wants people to exercise their constitutional rights while staying safe. “I want to encourage protestors to stay safe, and that means continuing to wear your face coverings. If you feel that you need to be out on the streets to maintain social distancing, 6-feet apart to the extent possible,” Brown said. There are growing concerns of a spike in coronavirus cases, especially in Multnomah County. It’s the only one of Oregon’s 36 counties that has not yet applied for a phase 1 reopening. Officials are expected on Friday to seek approval, which could lead to an initial reopening as early as June 12. One of Oregon’s seven prerequisites before approving a county for the first phase of reopening is that it must have had 14 days of decline in COVID-19 hospital admissions. The way mass gatherings can provide a breeding ground for the virus to spread, it’s possible that a spike in hospitalizations in Multnomah County would prevent it from meeting that benchmark. Despite that, during a press conference Monday, Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury said the county still expects to submit an application Friday with that June 12 reopening date as a target. “We are concerned. We’re nervous. We really don’t want to be reopening to benefit some at the expense of others. I think if we saw a big spike in the number of people who had contracted COVID-19, especially if they end up hospitalized, that would be a sign for us,” Kafoury said. “I think we would much rather slow our reopening plan then to reopen and then have to close back down.” Kafoury said Multnomah County’s plan to reopen will focus on putting the well-being of communities of colors first. But despite putting their best plan forward, she said if coronavirus has taught them anything, it’s that things never seem to go to plan. An Oregon Health Authority spokesman said it’s concerned large gatherings will increase the spread of coronavirus. OHA Lead Communications Officer Jonathan Modie said OHA recognizes and honors people exercising their constitutional right to peacefully assemble. “Right now, the state is in the midst of a pandemic. Large gatherings do raise the risk of transmitting the virus,” Modie said. “So we encourage people taking part in these protests to do everything they can to practice important prevention steps we have been talking about for the past three months.” Community organizer Fran Bittakis said she’s been doing just that: trying to encourage fellow protesters to stay safe. The group she founded, Snack Bloc, has been providing free materials to meet demonstrators’ basic needs. That includes water, food and changes of clothes. She said Snack Bloc has also passed out hand sanitizer, gloves, and face masks but this time around, groups have donated facial cloth masks. Bittakis said initially she wavered on whether she should be there. On the one hand, she wanted to keep her community safe by continuing to practice responsible social distancing and staying close to home. But in the end, she decided, “I need to use my privilege and be there and support this effort and the folks that would be there.”",0.0

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

And not all the demonstrations have been in Portland or Eugene. People upset with the status quo have gathered in Medford, Ashland, Hermiston, Pendleton and Klamath Falls. Sage Van Wing/OPB One man who didn’t expect to find himself demonstrating in the streets of Klamath Falls Sunday night is Frederick Brigham, a musician and artist who goes by the name “Wreck the Rebel.” But he told OPB’s “Morning Edition” that in advance of the rally, he heard what he calls “false narratives” about what might happen at the protest. ”People said that there was a lot of Antifa vans, that they were going to bus people in from Portland and other places to come burn down the town and come riot and cause violence,” Wreck said, “and I didn’t believe that to be true.” Wreck said that didn’t happen, and the demonstration was mostly calm. He said counter-protesters did show up; some appeared intoxicated and acted belligerent. The police were there, mostly friendly, Wreck remembered. He said as a black man living in a largely white community, he wanted to support the other protesters – especially the many women in the crowd, and elderly people. “It’s eye-opening that so many people of all races could come together and stand for love: it’s white people, Mexican people, Asian people, black people, Native American people, all coming together and loving each other,” he said. Wreck took away from the activism a sense of hope. “It’s never going to be 100%, but I’d like to see the love increase, and that’s everywhere. Because when the love increases, things like police officers killing people would happen less.”",0.0

Their chants were now familiar refrains: “Who was killed?” “George Floyd!” “Who was murdered?” “George Floyd!” “Say his name!” “George Floyd!” “Say it louder!” Eugene police said in a news release protesters were blocking the road at 10th Avenue and Adams Street around 8 p.m. The news release said they also blocked traffic on 18th Avenue shortly before 10 p.m. and police advised them of a curfew. The protesters around 10:30 p.m. had occupied the intersection of Oak Street and 15th Avenue. They were staring up the block to 14th Avenue at an armored row of Eugene police blocking their path to downtown, where a curfew was in effect. The police were backed by an armored crowd-control vehicle of the same type that had been deployed the night before when police had fired chemical rounds from the vehicle and eventually dispersed the protesters with tear gas while making arrests. “A city of Eugene curfew is in effect from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., from High Street to Polk Street, from Fourth Avenue to 14th Avenue. If you fail to leave the area, you could be subject to arrest,” said a voice over the vehicle speaker. Throughout the march, protesters remained aware of police action over the past few days and seemingly did their best to avoid bringing down such a response on themselves. They warned each other about walking in the streets, and when phones later buzzed with news of a citywide curfew starting at midnight, they took notice. Instead of marching toward the police line and downtown, the demonstrators continued east on 15th Avenue. Flanked by bike-riding outriders, protected from drivers by marchers dedicated to stopping traffic for the column crossing streets and resupplied with several vehicles supporting the march with supplies and water, the crowd raised their voices and kept a steady pace up and down residential blocks. “Say his name!” “George Floyd!” There currently is a standoff between police and protestors, EPD on 14th staring down Oak Street at protesters on 13th. pic.twitter.com/iktsfjdhxR — adam duvernay (@DuvernayOR) June 2, 2020 Often, those living in the area would lean out windows and doors to chant along with them. Only once did they encounter obvious resistance: While blockers had a woman’s car stopped at an intersection, she swerved around them at a dangerous speed. Around 11:10 p.m., phones began buzzing with the emergency warning signal to inform locals of the curfew. The column came to a halt to deliberate and then turned around, marching back from E. 21st Avenue and Hillyard Street the way they came. The demonstrators arrived at the fairgrounds on 13th Avenue just before midnight, having not encountered police or problems since the standoff on Oak Street. A man at the head of the column then encouraged everyone to break up the march and head home. “We’ve been getting attacked every day,” he said of the police response to protests after curfew. “We made such a big movement today. We’ve had thousands of people watching all day. So let’s respect them and make our way back home.” They promised to return to their demonstrations Tuesday. “Our goal for tonight was to ensure people and property were safe,” Eugene police Chief Chris Skinner said in a news release. “The protest groups tonight were making efforts to stay on the sidewalk at times and although they did block traffic, there were no concerns that drew out the need to intervene tonight. The group exhibited care in the way they were moving through the community and should be commended.” Contact reporter Adam Duvernay at aduvernay@registerguard.com or 541-338-2237, and follow him on Twitter @DuvernayOR.

1623588990,2020-06-02 15:39:23,What is the Insurrection Act and why has it been invoked before?,http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/what-is-the-insurrection-act-and-why-has-it-been-invoked-bef.html,en,False,,662786,KNPT,http://www.knptam.com/,"iStock/FourOaks(WASHINGTON) -- BY: LIBBY CATHEY When President Donald Trump threatened Monday to use the active duty military to deal with nationwide violent protests over the last week, he was suggesting he might invoke a law more than 200 years old.  ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said in the White House Rose Garden.  To actually do so, he would need to employ what's known as the Insurrection Act of 1807.  Here are the basics:  What is the Insurrection Act?  Signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, the Insurrection Act empowers the American president and commander in chief to deploy military troops within the U.S. in particular circumstances, if they believe it is necessary to quell an ""insurrection"" that threatens a state or its residents.  It's essentially a legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces -- whether through federalizing the National Guard or calling in ""Title X forces"" to settle civil unrest.  The exception to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits active-duty troops from being deployed to U.S. states for routine use as police forces, is an important and expansive power granted to the president.  When has it been invoked?  The Insurrection Act has rarely been invoked in the 213 years it's been on the books -- but in modern times, presidents have typically assumed the power to deal with the American agony of racial conflict, even relying on the provision to uphold federal civil rights in the Deep South.  In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower called on the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division to safely escort nine black students into Little Rock Central High School after the Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, using the Arkansas National Guard under the guise of maintaining peace, tried to prevent the students from entering the school.  President John F. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act in 1962 and 1963 to send federal troops to Mississippi and Alabama to enforce civil rights laws. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions to Detroit when deadly riots broke out between police and residents and again invoked the law in 1968 in response to protests sparked by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  And in 1992, President George H.W. Bush responded to a request from Gov. Pete Wilson of California to help quell rioting in Los Angeles after the acquittal of the four LAPD officers who brutally beat Rodney King.  The act was revised after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to expand presidential power and again in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Under President George W. Bush and Lt. General Russell Honore, thousands of active duty troops were sent to New Orleans -- despite the objections of nearly every governor in the country at the time to expand the power.  How can it be invoked?  The Insurrection Act can be invoked at a state's request. A state legislature or governor could request assistance from the president to ""to suppress [an] Insurrection.""  The law states: ""If there is an insurrection in a State, the President, at the request of the State's legislature, or Governor if the legislature cannot be convened, may call National Guards of other States into Federal service as well as use the Federal military to suppress the insurrection.""  Two other Insurrection Act provisions allow a president to invoke it regardless of a state's wishes.  One provision permits it to be invoked if the president deems it necessary ""to suppress an insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy.""  The law states: ""Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages or rebellion against authority of United States makes it impracticable to enforce the law of the United States in any State or territory by judicial proceedings, the President may call into Federal service the militia of any State and use the Federal military to enforce the laws or suppress the rebellion.""  A third option -- the most generalized provision -- says the president can use the armed forces when there is an interference with federal or state law.  The president may use the military to suppress insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy if ""(a) it so hinders the execution of law of that State and of the United States and it deprives citizens of constitutional rights (e.g. due process); or (b) it opposes or obstructs the execution of laws or impedes the course of justice. In the event of the deprivation of rights, the State is deemed to have denied its citizens equal protection of laws.""  But first, a proclamation to disperse:  Prior to invoking the Insurrection Act, the president and the attorney general must first issue a ""proclamation to disperse.""  If the situation is not cleared, the president may then issue an executive order to send in troops, according to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service.  Has Trump invoked it?  The White House has not issued a proclamation text, and President Trump didn't use the words ""Insurrection Act"" in his Monday night statement.  But at least one Republican has already recommended it: Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a staunch conservative, advocated on Twitter that Trump employ the 101st Airborne Division.  The most notable time 101st Airborne Division was in Cotton's home state was in 1957 when Eisenhower used the Insurrection Act to force desegregation and safely escort nine black students into Little Rock Central High School.  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, was quick to dispute Trump's comments, rejecting the idea that the government can send troops to his jurisdiction.  ""I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker told CNN. ""He wants to change the subject from his failure over coronavirus, a miserable failure, and now see a moment when there's unrest because of the injustice that was done to George Floyd that he now wants to create another topic and something where he can be the law and order president.""  An ABC analysis:  John Cohen, former Acting Undersecretary for Intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, who is now an ABC News contributor, noted the U.S. military, as formidable as it is, isn't trained specifically to deal with civil unrest in the U.S.  ""Placing U.S. military personnel in the position of potentially using deadly force against other U.S. citizens is not something that should be done in a cavalier manner,"" Cohen said.  ""The experience of its deployment during the Los Angeles riots faced many logistical communication and operational challenges,"" added Cohen, also a former police officer who worked in Los Angeles county. ""It wasn't seen as a successful operation by many.""  Read the original text:  The original text of the act, which has been amended several times since it was first passed on March 3, 1807, reads as follows:  ""An Act authorizing the employment of the land and naval forces of the United States, in cases of insurrections. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases of insurrection, or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States, or of any individual state or territory, where it is lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection, or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ, for the same purposes, such part of the land or naval force of the United States, as shall be judged necessary, having first observed all the pre-requisites of the law in that respect.""  One more thing:  When the Insurrection Act was used in 1992, Attorney General William Barr was serving as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.  Editor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that President Lyndon B. Johnson invoked the Insurrection Act in 1967 and 1968 and that President John F. Kennedy did so in 1962 and 1963.

Mayor Ted Wheeler thanked protesters and organizers who kept an hours-long march and gathering peaceful and said he saw ""a community ready for healing and reconciliation."" The protest marked a turning point for Oregon's largest city after demonstrations the previous three nights spun into violence. Crowds set fires, shattered windows and broke into police headquarters and a corrections center during demonstrations over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck. ""I know that if we truly want justice for George Floyd, we have a long way to go. I know that, but last night I saw a community that's ready for both healing and reconciliation. I saw a progressive and mindful police bureau that deeply cares to to that work,"" Wheeler said. The evening was not without some violence, however. After the protest disbanded late Monday, about 100 people confronted police officers guarding the downtown Justice Center and threw projectiles at them, Police Chief Jami Resch said. Twelve people were arrested and two guns were seized from protesters, she said. A visibly angry Wheeler lashed out at Gov. Kate Brown for what he called her ""mischaracterization"" of his initial request for National Guard members to assist police. He had requested the Guard in a supportive role, to protect critical buildings, and not for crowd control or to make arrests, he said. Brown had told reporters that Wheeler asked her to deploy the Guard on the streets. ""Mayor Wheeler asked me over the weekend to mobilize the National Guard and put them in direct confrontation with protesters,"" Brown said during a Monday news conference. Wheeler said he called the governor after her remarks Monday and expressed his alarm. ""On an issue as sensitive as this, we have to, as leaders, get the facts straight,"" the mayor said Tuesday. ""'And the idea that I would ask the (governor) for the National Guard for the purpose of direct confrontation with demonstrators on the very same day that Trump said the military should be deployed into states to crush even peaceful demonstrations is incendiary.""

""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly.' On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump 'arguably' has the authority to use military force, 'so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. 'Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.' Thune said he would 'prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump's actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation's capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. 'This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. ... All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story.",0.0

Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as 'Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn's personality was 'bigger than life,' said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. 'He was a fun guy, a happy guy."" Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. 'We lost a wonderful citizen,' Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. 'David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.' Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee's business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. 'This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,' Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as 'Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. 'I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,' coach Tom Allen said in a statement. 'Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of Beaty's shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. 'She was always smiling, always laughing. That's why it's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,' Hale said. 'That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.' Separately, authorities said an officer was 'ambushed' with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn't released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report.",0.0

Omari Salisbury / phloating_man on Reddit [The following was originally posted in Seattle's The Stranger.—eds] You’ve probably seen the video by now: A line of protesters faces a line of cops on Seattle's Capitol Hill, an eye-catching purple umbrella held toward police as a shield. There’s no sign of aggression until a cop decides he wants the umbrella; there’s a short tussle; and then the police let loose the chemical agents against the crowd. As they spray, other protestors hold up shields of their own, which the cops dart forward to try to grab as well. But most of those shields are just out of reach, allowing a small group of protestors to remain on the south side of the street. In similar protests against state violence around the world, shields have emerged as an important mechanism to keep people safe from security forces—so let’s take a look at how other protestors have shielded themselves and others. Umbrellas seem to be the most ubiquitous and effective means of protection, provided that the people wielding them stay out of melee range. In particular, umbrellas became a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong in 2014, and remained in steady use through the protests of 2019. They’re cheap, lightweight, and it’s easy to carry several of them or hand them off. Hong Kong’s protesters developed a system of hand signals to indicate that umbrellas, hard hats, and other supplies were needed on the front lines of a protest, and created human chains to quickly deliver them. In some locations, a larger supply of items was kept at the back of the crowd and passed from person to person to the front, with runners carrying them for the last stretch. If an umbrella was snatched by police seeking to do harm, another was quickly put in its place. Other actions have involved shields made of … let’s say sturdier materials. In Kiev, citizens wielded large metal sheets with handles affixed to the back, allowing them to block rubber bullets. (For something more light-weight, cosplayers will tell you it’s easy to make a shield out of a garbage can lid and cabinet handle.) They also erected nets over police barricades, blocking stun grenades. As in Hong Kong, many came prepared with helmets. In Chile, protesters came with whatever they could to protest human rights abuses: A kitchen sink to deflect bullets, street signs, cardboard boxes, and sheets of plywood. One protester became known as “Pare Man” or “Captain Pare” after he was photographed shielding himself with a stop sign, along with a street dog named Matapacos who was hostile to riot police. There’s rain in the forecast for this coming weekend. But you never know when you might need an umbrella.",0.0

In a call with President Donald Trump and governors on Monday -- a recording of which was obtained by ABC News, Esper urged states ""to dominate the battle space"" so that civil unrest ""dissipates and we can get back to the right normal.""  Over the last week, thousands of Americans have peacefully protested systemic racial inequality sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. But looting and riots in many American cities have caused states to activate the National Guard to support law enforcement -- with the president threatening to deploy the active duty military to quell the violence.  Two retired four-star generals took the rare step of publicly condemning Esper's comments on Monday, arguing the language was inappropriate to describe the current situation.   Congrats to @EsperDoD for making his mark in history.  Today he both ensured his name will be into countless future articles of how not to act in civil-military relations, and jumped much higher up the ranking list of worst Secretary of Defenses in history. https://t.co/sIX5pZcj43 — Peter W.

"" Not what America needs to hear...ever, unless we are invaded by an adversary or experience a constitutional failure...ie a Civil War...""Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed a similar sentiment, tweeting, ""America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy.""Asked about Esper's use of the term ""battle space,"" a senior defense official, who declined to be identified, told Pentagon reporters on Tuesday that the ""DOD often communicates in a parlance unique to the profession of arms.""""He was using the terms that we have,"" the official said. ""Nothing should be read into the use of that term to denote anything other than it's a common term to denote the area we are operating in.""Esper served 10 years in the U.S. Army on active duty and another 11 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve.A former senior administration official told ABC News that congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have privately expressed concerns about Esper's words because they could be seen as laying the groundwork for the invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy active duty troops within the United States under limited circumstances. The president would have to invoke the act because the active duty military -- unlike the National Guard -- is barred from carrying out law enforcement activities under Posse Comitatus Act.On Tuesday, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called on Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley to testify before his committee next week to explain the role they envision the U.S. military playing in response to protests.He also told reporters that language like ""battle space"" is ""deeply concerning in terms of how the U.S. military would be used for domestic law enforcement,"" though he had not personally spoken to Esper about it.As of Tuesday, governors in 28 states and the District of Columbia had activated more than 20,400 National Guard members to assist state and local law enforcement operations, according to the National Guard.But overnight, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, along with active duty military police units from Fort Bragg, Fort Drum and Fort Riley, staged at Joint Base Andrews outside of the nation's capital in case they were requested, according to two U.S. officials.""The decision to use active military forces in crowd control in the United States should only be made as a last resort,"" said ABC News analyst Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East.""The National Guard is fully capable and trained for these operations. They are from these communities and likely have been activated many times to support people after fires, hurricanes, or pandemics. Some of the people they helped are the ones protesting.

1623632446,2020-06-02 14:25:00,Portland Mayor Halts Curfew Amid 'Significant Shift in Tenor' Of Protests,https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-mayor-end-curfew-george-floyd-oregon-protest/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (5:51 p.m. PT) — Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has decided not to continue the city’s curfew into Tuesday night. City leaders have acknowledged the measure meant to control protests was largely ineffective at calming the surge of people who came onto the streets to demonstrate against police brutality. The announcement came after a night of overwhelmingly peaceful protests. Demonstrators made a slow loop from Revolution Hall to downtown’s Pioneer Courthouse Square and back, as they protested the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis. The protests saw little if any of the tear gas or vandalism that rocked the end of the previous three nights of protests. Rather, a handful of demonstrators acted as organizers for the night, leading a crowd of thousands across the city and bringing them to their destination outside Revolution Hall around 11:30 p.m. The demonstrators who had taken the lead thanked the crowd for gathering peacefully and told them to go home — a first since the demonstrations began Friday evening. “Last night marked a significant shift in the tenor of recent demonstrations,” Wheeler said appreciatively at a Tuesday morning conference. “And that’s worth calling out. Thousands of people filled our streets, and they did so peacefully.” Of the thousands who demonstrated peacefully, Police Chief Jami Resch said about 100 did not. She said a small group gathered downtown half an hour after the main demonstration ended and began throwing glass bottles and rocks at police. A dozen people were arrested, according to Resch. Police said they seized two guns. The morning post-protest press conference, which has become a daily event since protests took hold in Portland, also served as a chance for both Resch and Wheeler to push back against Gov. Kate Brown’s remarks Monday that the mayor had asked for the National Guard to confront protesters on the front lines. “I was alarmed last night to see the governor’s mischaracterization of the city’s request for the National Guard,” Wheeler said, adding he had asked for the troops to protect buildings and not to engage with demonstrators. “The idea I would ask the governor for the National Guard for the purpose of direct confrontation with demonstrators on the same day Donald Trump is saying military should be deployed into states to crush even peaceful demonstrations,” he continued later, “that is potentially incendiary.” In the absence of a curfew, protesters will be free to fill the streets Tuesday — and potentially many more nights to come — after 8 p.m. Without action from leadership that addresses the concerns of the protesters, Wheeler indicated he sees more nights of demonstrating on the horizon. “I don’t see how we move out of this current mode of thinking, which is large demonstrations demanding justice,” he said. “Until we get to the OK, we’ve now heard it, we’ve acknowledged it, so what concrete actions are we taking next, and I want to hear more from the community about what they think we should do.” The mayor indicated that both he and Resch would be meeting later Tuesday with people who he said he had been leaders of the demonstrations over these first four nights of protest. Afterward the police bureau invited media outlets to attend an event outside Self Enhancement Inc., where Wheeler, Resch, Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese, District Attorney Rod Underhill and U.S. Attorney Billy Williams met with four young protesters. The event was billed as “a small group of individuals representing the protesters,” though the people who met with city leaders readily said they weren’t well-known activists. “None of us are protest leaders or activists or any of that — we are just people that have concern for the communities that wanted to help,” said Michael Richards, 38, who grew up in North Portland. The demonstrators in Tuesday’s meeting said they met Friday, the night of the first protest, and began talking with police officers, which eventually landed them at SEI to meet with city leaders. But other well-known organizers expressed frustration in the aftermath of the meeting that four men without deep ties to groups that have been calling for changes for years were brought to ostensibly speak on behalf of protesters. “I’ve literally never seen these men before this week in my life,” tweeted community organizer Lilith Sinclair, who has emphasized the protests are a leaderless movement. “These people don’t represent us.” Wheeler said he had come to hear the perspectives of the four men, calling it the “beginning of the positive impetus for change in our community.” “This was an opportunity for us to have a frank conversation, to hear expectations,” the mayor said, adding that he plans more conversations in the future. Tony Hopson, the senior president and CEO of Self Enhancement Inc. said he was encouraged by the dialogue, which he said focused on what transparency, inclusion and accountability could look like in Portland. “It’s a great start. It’s only a start — got a lot more conversation we need to have going forward,” he said.",0.0

A 36-year-old Multnomah County woman died of COVID-19 this past weekend, the youngest known fatality yet in Oregon from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The Oregon Health Authority said the woman died Sunday, May 31, at Adventist Hospital. She tested positive for the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the same day. Oregon's death toll has risen to 157 with the updated numbers on Tuesday, June 2. A 66-year-old woman in Multnomah County and an 81-year-old woman in Washington County were also counted as part of COVID-19's growing death toll. Both of them died at home late last month, and both first tested positive for the coronavirus in early April. All three of the newest reported victims had underlying medical conditions, according to the OHA. Oregon has seen 4,335 confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 so far, and it has tested more than 134,000 people. The positive test rate is 3.1%, lower than the national average. New cases were reported Tuesday in nine counties. Multnomah County added 10 cases to its tally, Marion County added eight, and both Washington and Hood River counties added four. Lincoln and Wasco counties each saw two new cases. Benton, Linn and Umatilla counties added one apiece. All Oregon counties but Multnomah County have been given the go-ahead to partially reopen under ""Phase 1"" of a plan developed by state authorities. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown cautioned last month that case counts are expected to rise as businesses and public buildings open back up and people begin to gather in larger numbers. Additionally, demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody last week have turned out thousands of people onto the streets of Portland and Eugene, along with smaller rallies and marches in cities like Beaverton, Hermiston and Medford. Dr. Jerome Adams, the U.S. surgeon general, warned Monday, June 1, that mass gatherings to protest Floyd's death and police brutality will likely result in new COVID-19 outbreaks.

""All my money, I had I put into the store,"" Zola Dias, 38, told ABC News. ""And now I don't have a choice: It's over.""  He said that no police officers showed up to stop the looting at his shop late Friday night, but 15 cops appeared on Sunday afternoon after receiving a call that it was being vandalized while he was in there cleaning it up with some friends.  ""I was traumatized,"" Dias said. ""I was with three black men and 15 police come to us and they're thinking I was trying to vandalize my own store.""  ""To me, it was a double shock,"" he added. ""I cannot even speak.""  Dias said he found out on Friday night via social media that his fashion and sneaker shop, Attom, was being looted, and watched as clips rolled in of people smashing the windows with baseball bats.  ""They just stole everything,"" Dias said.  He said he didn't expect it to happen to his store because people in the area know him, and that he's the only black business owner in the posh Buckhead shopping center.  Dias said he supports the demonstrations over the killing of Floyd, but added, ""We have people protesting, and we have people who just want to vandalize. It's two different things.""  ""The people who came to vandalize my store, they weren't protesting anything, and it's not the way to protest,"" he said. ""You can protest peacefully, but there is a little group that is trying to take advantage of everything that's happening right now.  ""It's not the same. The people protesting and the people doing all this crazy stuff is not the same.""  Dias said he was under immense financial pressure to reopen after being closed for about three months because of COVID-19.  ""We planned to open on Monday, and then they broke [into] the store on Friday,"" he said.  Dias said right now it's looking like he'll have to close, as he's still behind on rent from when the store was recently closed. But he's not giving up hope, trying to raise funds to reopen via a GoFundMe page. He said that while he has insurance ""it doesn't cover everything.""  ""I'm with the people protesting, but don't be confused, because like I said there are people that are just trying to take advantage,"" he said. 'I'm ready to rage, I'm ready to protest, but I want to do it the right way'  Kris Shelby, the general manager and curator at Attom, said that he'd been following the protests on Friday, but ""the last thing on my mind was, are they going to start looting.""  He lives in an apartment with a view of the store, and said he saw a bunch of cars start pulling into the shopping center after midnight on Friday.  ""I'm just hearing glass break ... I hear people screaming and yelling,"" he said. ""And then I hear gunshots.""  He said he immediately wanted to go try to protect the store, but was worried about his safety ""or me hurting someone else.""  Shelby said he didn't sleep that night and when he walked to the store early the next morning ""everything was gone.""  ""I understand what's going on in our world right now -- I am a young black male who has been dealing with police since I was at a young age,"" he said. ""I've been dealing with that my entire life and having the fear of the police, it sucks.""  ""I'm mad, I'm pissed, I'm ready to rage, I'm ready to protest, but I want to do it the right way,"" he added. ""I'm out here because I want to see a change and make a difference, I'm not here because I want to tear down the city. I'm here to build up our community.""  Shelby's been at the store since the first day it opened in 2016, and said it's always strived to be a part of the community.  ""People just come hang out with us at Attoms shop, so that's why I didn't think that was going to happen to us,"" he said. ""We've shown nothing but love to the city of Atlanta, and we've helped a lot of local designers.""  He said he strongly supports the protests, but that looting ""isn't going solve anything.""  ""Go out there and protest, do what's right, try to get your voices heard,"" he said. ""But going out and looting isn't going to solve anything at all, the only thing that is going to do is set us back, because you are tearing down the places that we live at. You all live in this city as well.""  If there was one message he would give to his community right now, Shelby said it would be to ""beat the system"" by voting.  ""When it's time for us to vote, we need everybody out there at the voters poll so we can have a better world,"" Shelby said. ""I'm sick and tired. I just want to go to living a regular life where it doesn't matter what race you are, we can all live in this world together.""  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.' He underlined that Europeans 'support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are 'understandable and more than legitimate.' 'I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,' Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. 'It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,' Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., 'that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.' Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color 'is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.' ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP's latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Courtesy of Wikiquote Late last night and early this morning, a flood of black squares filled my Instagram feed. The posts were part of Blackout Tuesday, a ""social media movement"" (a.k.a. chainmail) meant to visually symbolize a moment of silence taken in honor of George Floyd, a Black man killed by Minneapolis police, and express solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. These posts quickly became counterproductive—many users included #BlackLivesMatter in their caption, flooding the hashtag with blacked-out posts. People who were using the hashtag to communicate about bail funds and other important protest information suddenly drowned in a sea of well-meaning non-Black people posting about not posting. This then prompted a wave of Black Lives Matter organizers and other users on both Twitter and Instagram asking to remove #BlackLivesMatter from the posts. Here is St. Louis activist Kenidra Woods demonstrating the problem: It has come to my attention that many allies are using #BlackLivesMatter hashtag w black image on insta. We know that’s it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message. We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!! pic.twitter.com/eG2fPaybNW — Kenidra4Humanity ~ BLACK LIVES MATTER ~ (@KenidraRWoods_) June 2, 2020 The call to amplify Black voices and movements turned into non-Black people amplifying their own willing silence. At best, the black squares represent a virtue signaling attempt at showing solidarity with Black people. Posting a square along with a hashtag is a surefire way to associate your brand with the radical work Black people are doing on the ground. But, ultimately, the confusion around Blackout Tuesday is an example of how, despite our best intentions, Instagram is extremely manipulative and primed to exploit misunderstanding to everyone's detriment. Originally, Blackout Tuesday was meant to target the music industry specifically, asking major players and labels to cease operations for one day to protest police brutality against Black people. Started by Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, two black women music executives, they intended to hold an industry that profits from Black art accountable for their (lack of) support of Black lives. Using #TheShowMustBePaused, the women listed a plan of action as well as bail funds and petitions for those looking to help out. But the movement quickly picked up momentum both inside and outside the industry, surpassing the organizers' original intentions and morphing into an endless black grid of posts on Instagram. It's still unclear exactly how their specific campaign turned into users posting black squares on their accounts under #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackoutTuesday. Though, we'd do well to remember that Instagram is owned by the Grand Daddy of Misinformation and Viral Posts—Facebook. Russian troll accounts used the social media site to spread discord and disinformation in the lead up to the 2016 election, creating social justice Facebook groups such as ""Black Matters U and ""Don't Shoot Us"" to increase tensions online. A part of me wonders if the momentum behind #BlackoutTuesday that ended up obscuring Black Lives Matter information channels was part of some sort of troll strategy, Russian or otherwise. While Twitter still suffers problems with misinformation and Black bot accounts, it's much more apt for posting and resharing news and organizing content than Instagram. My advice for non-Black people looking to help would be to continue to amplify the voices of Black people and organizers during this time, opening your purse, and remembering social media sites like Instagram aren't working for you, but against you. Don't share the black square!",0.0

Gore was referring to unrest in California in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed last month by a now-terminated Minneapolis police officer who knelt on the handcuffed man's neck. In one post, captioned ""Curfew,"" Gore is pictured wearing a face covering and holding an AR-style rifle. Another comment has Gore referring to unrest that happened on Sunset Boulevard Monday evening, saying he would ""light motherf***ers up who are trying to f*** w/ my property."" Another TV production crew member, Drew Janda, tweeted Gore's Facebook post to Meloni, and the actor responded by saying, in part, ""I have no idea who this person is or what they do.""

The news comes amid mounting reports of disinformation being spread online amid the protests over the killing of George Floyd.  The account, with the handle @ANTIFA_US, was traced back to be a false facade for the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. It was specifically called out by U.S. law enforcement as an example of a left-wing radical group attempting to incite violence amid the unrest and nationwide protests.  ""This account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. We took action after the account sent a Tweet inciting violence and broke the Twitter Rules,"" a Twitter spokesperson told ABC News.  Donald Trump Jr. even referenced the bogus account before it was taken down, calling it a ""terrorist organization"" and tweeting, ""They're not even pretending anymore.""  Twitter has taken action on other fake accounts linked to Identity Europa. The accounts were engaged in hateful conduct focused on issues of race, religion and sexual orientation.  Before the fake Antifa account was suspended, it drew significant media attention for a tweet that incited violence, according to Twitter.  Antifa -- short for ""anti-fascists"" -- is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups, according to the Associated Press.  Meanwhile, as the protests over Floyd's death continue to roil the nation, social media has become ripe with disinformation.  ""Time and time again we have seen public figures, media personalities and even government officials amplifying disinformation and extremist rhetoric intended to inspire violence,"" John Cohen, a former senior Department of Homeland Security official and current ABC News contributor, said. ""A great step in deescalating the violence currently facing the Nation would be for this to end.”  Twitter said it is also actively investigating the hashtag #dcblackout and have suspended hundreds of ""spammy accounts"" that were using it on Monday.  The hashtag first started trending on Monday morning. Twitter users posted about an internet blackout in Washington, D.C., and a cover-up attempt to silence protesters via the hashtag.  Internet monitor NetBlocks said, however, there was no indication of mass-scale internet disruption in the nation's capital in the last 48 hours. As disinformation spread about the internet blackout, a counter-narrative was also apparently being boosted by bots alerting people that the #dcblackout was ""misinformation.""  It appears the goal of these efforts was to sow confusion and fear.  ""Our teams have been taking action proactively on any coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation around this issue,"" a Twitter spokesperson said.  Meanwhile, the National Capital Region Threat Intelligence Consortium issued an alert Monday, saying that in the last 24 hours unknown entities have been spreading disinformation in order to fuel violence amid the ongoing protests and unrest. ""Late Sunday night, May 31, 2020, social media reports began to surface claiming that protesters 'broke into' the White House, gun shots around the area were heard, and that President Trump and his family fled to Kansas,"" the alert stated.  The alerted added that the Twitter post featured a video with a large group of people running up steps toward a building with white columns.  ""However, this video did not feature the White House, but appeared to be filmed in front of the steps of the State House in Columbus, Ohio,"" it added. ""Multiple Twitter accounts, some of which appeared to behave in a bot-like manner and featured Arabic writing on their profiles, began to retweet this video, perpetuating the spread of disinformation. Some Twitter users recognized the building featured in the video and attempted to correct the narrative.""  The analysts also wrote about the #dcblackout hashtag, saying a number of ""legitimate and bot-controlled accounts retweeted this message.""  The actors behind the social media campaign remain unknown, ""but the intent of the messaging appears to be an attempt to instill fear and cause confusion among the populace,"" according to the alert.  A report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Washington field office analyzing the impact of the demonstrations in the D.C. area found online messages calling for attacks on places including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee headquarters in D.C. and Federal Reserve banks across the country.  Fake videos have also been distributed online that purportedly showed D.C. cops shooting black people and bogus messages willing to pay people to be ""professional anarchists,"" according to the FBI report.  Even though President Donald Trump and other senior officials insist that law enforcement's concerns are confined to agitators on the political left, the FBI report states that ""some militia members issued calls to travel to participate in the demonstrations, as part of their anti-law enforcement and anti-government agenda.""

(KOIN) — Government leaders from around the region met with a small group of young black men Tuesday to discuss peace and change. The theme at the meeting was clear: a lot of learning and listening needs to happen among government leaders and also among people in the black community. The four men–who all provided only their first names–didn’t even know each other until Friday night’s protest. They all admit that despite their limited background in activism and politics, they all have a deep concern for the prosperity of the black community. Andre: “I think most people are scared right now with all that’s going on. So I think poise is necessary. Self control for our own people is very much necessary.” Lyfe: “Last night’s demonstration […] was so peaceful. That is the goal. I understand some people fight fire with fire and we cant control that. But, if you listen to the words of George Floyd’s own brother, he does not want any violence.” Xiaa: “The people walking through the streets are not the same people burning the city.

PORTLAND, Ore. — After a night of mostly peaceful protests Monday night, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said he won't extend the citywide curfew for Tuesday. Wheeler spoke to the media Tuesday morning about the ongoing protests in Portland. He was joined by Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch. KGW is streaming the press conference live on kgw.com and on our social media channels (YouTube, Facebook and Twitter). Wheeler said Monday night's protests marked a significant shift in the tone of the demonstrations. ""What we're witnessing is a truly extraordinary moment in our country. People uniting to support our black community,"" Wheeler said. ""Yes again, there were a limited few who stayed behind to attempt to wreak havoc, but they were encouraged by demonstrators to stop taking away from their message. Demonstrators set the tone for peace and non-violence. ""That is why tonight, I am not extending the curfew,"" Wheeler said. During Tuesday's press conference, Wheeler said Oregon Gov. Kate Brown mischaracterized the reason he and other Portland leaders asked for the National Guard to be deployed. ""I was alarmed last night to see the governor's mischaracterization of the need for the National Guard. They were requested by me and by the Bureau to protect buildings, not on front lines. That was never the case,"" Wheeler said. ""The National Guard was never requested for purpose of direct confrontation with demonstrators. I will always stand up for justice. I will always support the public's safety. That's my duty, obligation and my personal values,"" the mayor said. During Monday's press conference, Wheeler said the National Guard should be used only to protect facilities if deployed. ""If the National Guard is deployed, they'd protect facilities,"" Wheeler said. ""Crowd control and policing will be left to law enforcement who are trained for that."" When the governor announced the deployment of the National Guard later Monday, she said Wheeler had asked her to deploy the National Guard ""and put them in direct confrontation with protesters."" ""Mayor Wheeler asked me over the weekend to mobilize the National Guard and put them in direct confrontation with protesters. This was not the first time the mayor has asked to mobilize the National Guard and not the first time i have declined,"" Brown said. Brown said she would deploy the National Guard but in ""a support function role only."" ""They will not be on the front lines, making arrests or doing crowd control. They will be acting as support personnel, behind the scenes only,"" she said. In a follow-up question, Wheeler said he thinks Gov. Brown has done a good job in a difficult situation but he said in times like this, facts matter. ""I think the governor has done a really fine job under these circumstances. But it's a fragile time. And on sensitive issues, we have to gets facts straight. My concern is there's a danger in mischaracterization, so it's important to get facts straight,"" Wheeler said. Resch also said she never asked for the National Guard to assist on the front lines. ""I at no time, asked for the National Guard to come down here and back up police. I did ask for them to secure buildings. We used a combination of OSP troopers and guards to secure [the Multnomah County] Justice Center. I don't think they were visible but that's what they did,"" she said. Wheeler also spoke about what needs to happen next once the protests have ended. ""I don't see how we don't move forward from these large demonstrations to, 'OK, we hear you, what concrete things can we do next?'"" he said. ""While I'm out in the community, I need to be out in the community more visibly most of the time. I need to find every opportunity to connect with, meet and hear stories of those individuals. Fewer forums where I do all the talking, and I just want to listen. ""Here I am in the middle of a global pandemic and I am feeling this spark of incredible optimism and we're at a tipping point toward something transformative and positive,"" Wheeler said. Monday night marked the fourth day of protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd, the Minnesota black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. A group of thousands of demonstrators peacefully protested for hours Monday night. After that group disbanded on their own accord for the night, a clash between police and a separate, smaller group of about 100 people took place in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police say they arrested at least a dozen people and seized two firearms. ""Thousands of demonstrators participated in an extensive march without engaging in violence or destructive behavior,"" Resch tweeted early Tuesday morning. ""Thank you for keeping this event peaceful. Your efforts to police the event yourselves created a safer environment for all. ""We will continue to arrest and hold responsible those who engage in acts of violence directed at the police, community members, or who commit other criminal acts,"" Resch said. During Tuesday's press conference, Resch reiterated that police will support the right to protest. ""We had a majority peaceful evening [Monday] but we had 100 or so people who caused trouble. We have to protect that essential building down there [the Multnomah County Justice Center]. Self-policing is what police are hopeful for. We 100% support your right to come down here,"" she said. For the second straight night, Resch met with community and protest leaders for ""an open, honest discussion."" ""I met with three people who are peaceful group leaders. They requested to meet with me and we met at Central Precinct. Sometimes coming in here can be very intimidating. We sat down and had an open, honest discussion. We came to a mutual understanding. We were looking for peace, forward movement. They were supportive of the actions we do honorably. Our community is supportive when we do the right thing.""",0.0

The two previous nights saw protests at the State Capitol turn into riots in downtown Salem, and the Salem Police Department responded by firing tear gas into mobs and arresting citizens. But on Monday, two uniformed Salem Police Department officers slowly made their way from the back of the crowd and up the park to the front where they surveyed the those assembled. Then, they both knelt with everyone else. The dramatic gesture made an impression on the protesters, and Salem Police Lt. Treven Upkes and Lt. Jason VanMeter exchanged handshakes and hugs with members of the audience. Upkes read a letter from the City of Salem, Salem-Keizer NAACP and the Salem Police Department supporting the crowd's right to peaceful assembly, acknowledging their concerns and that the community still has work to do to stop injustices. He then answered questions from many of the protesters. After the tensions rapidly escalated the prior nights, the gesture of the Salem Police Department was met with a round of applause from the crowd, and Monday’s protest remained peaceful. ""It was a small step, but yet again a huge step at the same time,"" said Juan Trevino III, a protester from Salem. ""Ultimately this is showing that they are wanting to work with us, and as long as we give them the same respect to work with them, then we can pursue a better relationship with them and end the riots here in Salem, end the chaos and the violence. ""And that’s ultimately the goal to end them everywhere in the nation when they get an agreement with their officers that they are wanting to bring peace."" In the days that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department, protests erupted around the United States, including riots in Salem that led to graffiti at the State Capitol, buildings damaged in downtown and police being targeted by protesters. Most of those who participated in the vigil and protest left the area at the event. A small group of people did not comply with the city-issued curfew and gathered near Winter and Chemeketa streets. ""Those individuals began throwing projectiles, explosive devices, water and other objects at the officers,"" Salem police spokeswoman Lt. Debbie Aguilar said Monday. Seven people were arrested and taken into custody. No injuries of participants or officers were reported. No additional property damage was reported. Off those arrested, many were in their late teens. Upkes said the Salem Police Department normally works with those who want to hold organized protests and admitted it was caught off guard by the protests and riots on Saturday and Sunday. Monday’s gesture by the officers went a long way in reaching out to the community. ""Tonight looked like it was the first opportunity for us to do that,"" Upkes said. ""Last night, really, there didn’t seem to be someone or a group of people we could actually have a dialogue with. ""This is a touchstone and a momentous time in history, and we’re going to try to be a part of that, and we got to fix the issues that people are upset about."" Until the dramatic entrance by the officers, the Salem Police Department and Oregon State Police went out of their way to not let their presence be felt, except when a passing Salem Police Department officer waved as he passed the crowd. Protesters started gathering at the State Capitol around 5 p.m. and chanted sayings like, ""Say his name. George Floyd,"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" The group, which grew to around 200 by 7:30 p.m., started a march through city streets downtown, winding its way back to the Capitol Mall. After that, officers from the Salem Police Department and Oregon State Police blocked off roads and watched as the protest remained peaceful and people took turns addressing the crowd on a megaphone. Salem was placed under a curfew of 8 p.m. Monday by City Manager Steve Powers, but it wasn’t enforced on those at the Capitol, even when the crowd that had grown to about 500 marched again to the site of the new Salem Police Department on Division Street by candlelight. ""If they want to stand on the Capitol steps, it’s up to Oregon State Police to make a determination, but I’m pretty sure there’s not a lot of trespassing that takes place on the people’s property,"" Upkes said. ""If we can talk to people that are level headed and want to take a trip through downtown, we can help provide that. It’s when we veer outside that peaceful that we got to evaluate the situation."" Many in the crowd left their candles burning at the construction barricades on Liberty Street where they again chanted and talked with police. Leaders of the protest at the Capitol announced they would meet again at 8 p.m. Tuesday for another peaceful protest and encouraged those assembled to go home, most of whom had. What seemed to ultimately change the course of the protest was the communication by the police with the protesters rather than against them as they had the previous nights. ""Ultimately what had happened in Minneapolis is due to police brutality, a police officer going over with excessive force and causing his death,"" said Trevino, who started a WalkWithUs Movement group on Facebook to work with the police in the protests. ""And that’s ultimately the core problem and what we need to do is come together with our police and say, we don’t have this issue here in Salem, so our police office should not have a problem committing to say, hey, we’re going to go ahead and make a stand ... that we can end that."" bpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com or Twitter.com/bpoehler",0.0

It's part of a unique, donation-based community mural program, in which PSAA provides curatorial control and artists provide considerable open creative freedom in their work. The mural nonprofit said that female/femme/non-binary artists are highly underrepresented when it comes to overall access to painting in public space. So, not all perspectives are being told in the artistic landscape; it's an art form that has been male-dominated, PSAA said. The mural team includes Tatyana Ostepenko (born and raised in Ukraine), Salomee (Algerian/Peruvian born in Switzerland), Amaranta Colindres (Santa Ana, El Salvador), Isis Fisher (Hawaii), Kyra Watkins (Cincinnati) and Sunny Beard (Reno, Nevada). For more: www.killianpacific.com. In addition, the Old Town Mural Project started last week (#pdxartistsgive). Artists are giving time to add mural art to three boarded-up Old Town storefronts (at 115 N.W. First Ave., 223 S.W. Ash St. and 500 N.W. Davis St.). Artists include Adam Brock Ciresi, Eyedrawp, Amy Ruppel, Leah Samour, Alicia Schultz (Vine & Thistle), Sophie, Consu Tolosa, Jennifer Urquhart and Arielle Zamora. Portland Art Museum donated paint; Urquhart, the coordinating artist, is a support of PAM and is married to Don Urquhart, PAM director of collections and exhibitions. • Online lectures — The Voices Lecture Series had to cancel its remaining 2019-20 lectures, but it plans to resume lectures in spring 2021. See www.voicesinc.com for more. In the meantime, it has launched the Voices Reunion Tour, a monthly series featuring past speakers in a Q&A format on Zoom. The schedule: June 11 — Ruth Wariner, author of ""The Sound of Gravel"" July 9 — Marin Alsop, Baltimore Symphony Orchestra music director Aug. 13 — Lisa Shannon, co-founder and CEO of Every Woman Treaty and women's rights activist and scholar Sept. 9 — Asenath Andrews, founder of Catherine Ferguson Academy, a Detroit alternative public high school for teen mothers and education service for their children Oct. 15 — Elaine Sciolino, a New York Times contributing writer and former Paris bureau chief • Cool show — A Portland violinist, looper and vocalist, Joe Kye, is curating a weekly livestream on his Facebook and YouTube channels and is inviting guest artists for collaborations and conversations, performs musical improvisations, hosts a kids' corner (i.e. parental break) and instigates dance parties. It's called ""Cup o' Joe,"" and Kye calls Fred Rogers his hero and ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" his inspiration. His next show features illustrator Mike Bennett, creator of ""A to Zoo"" public art, a playful yard display with animals beginnig with every letter of the alphabet; Bennett has gained notoriety by creating cartoon wood cutouts and placing them in Portland neighborhoods. It was originally scheduled for June 6, but it has been postponed to June 13. Future guests are: Ching Ching Wong, a Princess Grace-winning dancer; Andru Defeye, a Sacramento poet; Sharon Nyree Williams, a Seattle-based storyteller and arts organizer. Kye was born in Korea and raised in Seattle. • No summit — The 2020 Pan African Festival and Black Business Summit, scheduled for August in Portland, have been canceled.

Demonstrations are being held around the country in response to Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday, May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, held Floyd, an African-American man, on the ground for several minutes by placing a knee on his neck, even after Floyd became unconscious. The incident was captured on video and shared widely the following day, kicking off protests in Floyd’s home city which quickly spread across the country by the end of the week. Chauvin was fired and has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The other officers involved with the arrest have not been charged. Sienna Kaske, an OSU ethnic studies student, was one of the organizers of the vigil and demonstration titled “Justice for Black lives: in solidarity with Minneapolis,” along with James Duncan II, Destiny Franklin, Ameer Fofanah, Xenia Velasco, Roman Cohen and Kobe Natachu, six OSU students, and Manju Bangalore, a University of Oregon graduate and activist. Kaske, a longtime activist, said she reached out to the others on Friday when she saw there had not been a demonstration scheduled already. A smaller group of demonstrators gathered Saturday, May 30. Kaske said she wants the Corvallis Police Department to receive diversity training and to listen, hear and act on the concerns raised by demonstrators, and to realize they are not going to stop fighting. On Saturday, the Corvallis Police Department shared a joint statement on Facebook from the Oregon Association Chiefs of Police, Oregon State Sheriff’s Association and Oregon State Police condemning the tactics used by Chauvin that allegedly resulted in Floyd’s death. “Corvallis should be scared because the people aren’t going to stand down,” Kaske said. Kaske wants those who did not participate in the demonstration to think about why they chose not to, saying “Your silence kills.” Kaske was pleased with the turnout and expected attendees to be loud. She said she hopes participants will continue their involvement after they go home, whether that means filming police interactions or buying a neighbor's groceries. Numerous speakers connected the demonstration to earlier eras of unrest, some feeling that nothing substantial has changed. Kaske said she believes her generation has learned from previous generations and will continue to fight until violence and discrimination are defeated. The vigil portion of the event began with a mournful song sung by Genesis Hansen, an African-American whose arrest in October on charges of interfering with an Oregon State Police officer and resisting arrest, also captured on video, sparked controversy earlier this year. Those charges against Hansen, who was an OSU student at the time, were later dropped after the DA found them to have no legal basis, and OSP ended its contract with OSU. After chants of “No justice, no peace”—which would become a refrain throughout the evening— OSU student Ameer Fofanah discussed the lack of empathy for black Americans he believes Floyd’s death indicates, as well as Fofanah’s long family history of activism in the Black Freedom Struggle. “Every person I know has had the talk about how to be black in America... so they can survive in this nation,” Fofanah said. Fofanah spoke about his experience as a child hearing from his parents not to wear hoodies or keep his hands in his pockets when he was out, for fear of scrutiny from the police. Chants of “Black Lives Matter,” another refrain heard throughout the demonstration, led into the next set of speakers, who called on attendees to remain conscious of racial discrimination at all times. A later speaker, Duncan, called on people to join together and compared the violence seen at other demonstrations around the country to the explosive riots in Los Angeles after the controversial beating of Rodney King. King’s severe beating at the hands of four L.A.P.D. officers was captured on camera and the four officers were tried on charges of police brutality. Three of the officers were acquitted and the jury failed to reach a verdict regarding the fourth, which was perceived by many as unjust, leading to riots which caused the death of more than 55 people and the destruction of 600 buildings. Two of the officers were later convicted on federal civil rights charges and King was awarded $3.8 million in damages. A high point of tension during the Corvallis demonstration came when a man across the street from the courthouse repeatedly yelled “All lives matter” and “Everybody matters,” to which Duncan responded “He can’t shut me up” and many in the crowd attempted to drown the man out with more cries of “Black Lives Matter.” According to Kaske, Sunday's demonstration remained peaceful thanks in part to volunteer crowd managers who circulated to look out for suspicious or violent behavior. At least five people have been killed nationwide in violence connected with the Floyd protests, according to The New York Times. Ricky Carson, who grew up in Corvallis, spoke next about local problems with racial discrimination, reminding attendees that the state of Oregon was founded for whites only and calling for policy change. After the speakers were finished, Cohen, one of the event organizers, urged the crowd to kneel for five minutes of silence to honor the memory of black people killed by police officers. After the silent reflection, many of these names were chanted including Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland and Ahmaud Arbery. Other call-and-response chants included “If we don’t get it, shut it down,” “End police brutality” and “When our communities are under attack, what do we do? Stand up fight back.” The demonstration broke up a little before 8 p.m., after the final, loudest chant of “Black Lives Matter.”",0.0

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

Karen Bass, D-Calif., the chair of the caucus, told ABC News.  A federal chokehold ban, a review of police training standards and a reform of the legal doctrine that shields police officers from legal liability are some of the proposals circulating among the group, which House Democratic leaders have tasked with leading the chamber’s response to Floyd’s death and the ongoing protests.  ""We are going to do everything we can, while the nation has a height of awareness on the issue, to pass transformative legislation,"" said Bass. ""We want to make sure that, in this time period, we are very visible so that African Americans around the country understand that this is our experience as well.""  Republicans and Democrats have been united in condemning the events leading up to Floyd’s death, but any broad and rapid compromise on policing reforms are unlikely on Capitol Hill -- particularly in an election year when lawmakers are already struggling to agree on how to address the ongoing coronavirus and economic crisis.  Still, the caucus hopes to use the moment to promote new ideas for policing reform, as well as proposals that have stalled in committee and previous sessions of Congress. The effort could also lead to action in 2021 depending on the results of the presidential election.  ""Of course it is a responsibility of all of us to take the time to heal. But we are looking to them for their values-based, sad experience, and their leadership in terms of legislation,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said of the caucus on Tuesday.  Former vice president Joe Biden on Tuesday endorsed a federal police chokehold ban from Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., calling it a ""down payment on what is long overdue.""  Jeffries first proposed the measure in 2015 after the death of Eric Garner. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the topic in September 2019, but the proposal has yet to advance out of committee.  On Monday, Sen. Cory Booker D-N.J., along with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called for reforming the federal statute governing police misconduct and the qualified immunity legal doctrine, which has been used to shield police officers and other government officials from some lawsuits.  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a senior member of the caucus, plans to reintroduce the Law Enforcement Trust Integrity Act of 2015, a measure that would overhaul police training standards and incentivize oversight and accountability reforms.  Beyond the caucus, Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, said he planned to introduce a bill to end qualified immunity and allow victims of excessive police force to sue officers in court, a proposal also backed by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.  ""All of us want to get at the root causes of the lack of police accountability and want to be able to hold police accountable in court for their misconduct,"" Bass told ABC News, adding that lawmakers want to ""end the careers of abusive officers"" and prevent fired officers accused of using excessive force from being hired by other police departments.  While Republicans have supported plans for police brutality hearings and condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s death, some have also called for more attention to the outbreaks of violence and looting amid the largely peaceful protests across the country.  Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the former ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler that his committee should look into anti-facist 'antifa' protestors and their activities in addition to any examination of police brutality. Nadler plans to hold a hearing on new criminal justice proposals and police brutality as soon as next week, according to aides.  In the Senate, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has pledged to hold a hearing on policing and use of force, while Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, plans to push to end a Pentagon program to transfer military equipment to American police departments, a move endorsed by a top aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. on Twitter.  Bass predicted that the House will have legislation ready for passage by the end of the month, when the chamber is expected to return to Washington for votes.  ""This is a unique time that is allowing us to come together because the people are angry,"" said Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, a member of the caucus who was pepper-sprayed at a protest in Columbus, Ohio, over the weekend, ""They’re crying out for answers.""  Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

Bill Pugliano / Getty News Here's your daily roundup of all the latest local and national news. (Like our coverage? Please consider donating to the Mercury to keep it comin'!) • Last night saw a fourth night of protests against police violence and the killing of George Floyd throughout Portland. It was the most peaceful night we've seen so far—both from the thousands of protestors and the Portland Police Bureau (PPB)—though there was a midnight clash between a crowd of 100 and cops which ended in arrests. You can check out our live updates from the night here. More protests are planned for the night, stay tuned to the Mercury for live updates.  • The hours leading up to last night's protests, however, were decidedly less chill. PPB blocked off 16 blocks in the city's downtown core, and Gov. Kate Brown announced she would send National Guard troops and Oregon State Troopers to provide backup for PPB. They didn't make a public appearance last night, however. • If you're considering protesting in the near future, it's always a good idea to bring an umbrella (and not just for rain). • Mayor Ted Wheeler has decided against extending Portland's 8pm curfew for another night, noting that it wasn't particularly effective in the first place, and cited last night's peaceful protest at Pioneer Courthouse Square as an ""extraordinary moment in history,"" and a ""significant shift"" in tone.  Police unions have become increasingly rightwing as a backlash to the Obama administration and Black Lives Matter — and that’s bad news for the cities they police. From @MelissaDSegura https://t.co/RnM93ehL0v — Oregon Justice Resource Center (@OJRCenter) June 2, 2020 • For those who think the media needs to stop focusing so much on the destruction aspect of protests, and more on the smaller stories that illuminate and address the root of the problem... well, please read this note to you from our editor-in-chief, Wm. Steven Humphrey. • David Gerstenfeld, the new interim director of the Oregon Employment Department, admits that the progress towards paying out the hundreds of thousands of valid claims the agency is behind on is ""not an easy, coasting path at this point,"" thanks to a processing system reliant on 1990s-era tech that ""routinely makes erroneous claims denials.""

He followed this speech by walking to the nearby St. John's Church (that he doesn't go to) in order to hold a Bible (that he doesn't read) upside down for the sake of using the footage in a Twitter video. • In order for him to walk to that church, he had a peaceful protest nearby tear-gassed, and used National Guardsmen to physically clear out not just protesters, but international journalists, and even church clergy.  Trudeau’s very, very long pause after being asked about what’s happening in the US speaks volumes louder than his actual responsepic.twitter.com/B1G3dZkilO — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) June 2, 2020 • The Department of Defense denied any foreknowledge of the police action that occurred before Trump's speech, despite the fact the flashbangs and tear gas were audible both before and during the president's remarks. So who did give the order to assault clergy, press, and peaceful protesters? None other than Attorney General William P. Barr! • Just because Secretary of Defense Mark Esper urged governors to use the National Guard to ""dominate the battlespace,"" in reference to growing protests around the nation, it doesn't mean you should look too much into the terrifying and hawkish term ""battlespace,"" says a senior defense official. WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE DO THAT? • Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ripped Trump a new one in a speech this morning, comparing the president's racist language to that of Southerners from the '60s, and that he's turned this country into a ""battlefield."" All true enough! • So how is Congress responding to these overtly authoritarian and fascist acts? Well... the Senate Judiciary Committee will officially begin their sham ""investigations"" into already-debunked political conspiracy theories regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on Wednesday, June 3. • Civil rights leaders are ""disappointed and stunned"" after call with top Facebook villains: “We are disappointed and stunned by Mark [Zuckerberg]’s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,” wrote civil rights leaders from various organizations. “He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump’s call for violence against protesters. Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.” • Facebook-owned social media app Instagram was rendered mostly unusable today, as the ""Blackout Tuesday"" initiative begun by the music industry was appropriated by hundreds of thousands of people, leading to actual activist accounts being drowned out by mostly-content-free black squares with a #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, preventing easy access to their informative posts about upcoming protest actions and relief efforts.  gonna be hard to find a worse one of these today https://t.co/RCFjuQnnmt — Brandy Jensen (@BrandyLJensen) June 2, 2020 • With everything going on, we totally missed this story: 'Tiger King': Joe Exotic Loses Zoo to Carole Baskin In Court Ruling • And finally, OH THANK GOD THEY'RE HERE!

""He probably wore out his remote control watching the clips of General Barr's victory over the unarmed in the battle of Lafayette Square,"" Schumer, D-N.Y., scoffed. ""Then he reveled in the sounds of Black Hawks flying overhead joyously retweeting scores of preening sycophants.""  Attorney General William Barr visited Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C. to survey law enforcement prior to the president’s church visit, and also joined Trump and several other White House officials on his journey across the park to the church Monday evening.  With reports that law enforcement used tear gas to disperse peaceful protestors in advance of Trump’s visit to the church, Schumer also called on the Pentagon’s inspector general to lead an investigation into how the military was used at Lafayette Park in tandem with the president’s photo opportunity.  ""After the gas, came the horses -- a modern-day cavalry was clearing the battlefield. The purpose, so that President Trump could wave a Bible, not read a Bible, not even his Bible, as a prop,"" Schumer said. ""It was appalling. It was an abuse of presidential power. It may well have been illegal and it was blatantly unconstitutional.""  Moments earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded local, state and federal officials for working to ""restore peace"" amid raging civil unrest across the country, maintaining his disdain for violence associated with the protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.  During remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning, McConnell called for a distinction between peaceful protests and ""violent riots.""  ""The former is a cherished constitutional right that ever single citizen should support. The latter is an unacceptable scourge that state and local leaders should have ended days ago,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""So I want to thank federal state and local leaders who are taking seriously the obligation to restore peace, protect the innocent and stop this senseless violence.""  The Kentucky Republican, who is up for reelection to a sixth term this fall, called for the nation to unite not just against the killing of Floyd but also against those who are protesting violently.  ""Our nation is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing of Mr. Floyd. We are united,"" McConnell reaffirmed. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace on our streets and peace in our community.""  ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who only seek to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing,"" McConnell continued.  Schumer also condemned violent protest methods but argued that while thousands of protesters have been detained, only one of the four police officers involved in Floyd's killing has been arrested.  ""It does not excuse the violence in anyway but explains in part why so many Americans are angry,"" Schumer said. ""There is accountability for every day citizens and protesters when they break the law, but there isn't always accountability for those in law enforcement when it does the same.""  As the Senate leaders squabbled in the chamber, Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham announced he plans to hold a hearing on June 16 to examine the death of Floyd and police misconduct in the United States, promising to ""take a deep dive"" into the issue in two weeks.  ""The topic for the country is what to do after the death of Mr. Floyd, and what does the death of Mr. Floyd mean?"" Graham, R-S.C., said at the outset of a hearing he chaired examining the country’s operation of its prisons during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Well, it’s a long-overdue wake-up call to the country that there are too any of these cases where African American men die in police custody under fairly brutal circumstances. It’s clear to me that policing and among men in the African American community is a topic that needs to be discussed and acted upon, and I expect this committee to do its part.""  Graham, who has often counted himself as one of the president’s top defenders and golfing buddies, said he has consulted with the panel’s ranking Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and they’ve penciled in June 16 for a hearing, adding that’s as ""quick as we could do it.""  ""I’d like to get to the root cause of it. Mr. Floyd’s case is outrageous on its face, but I think it speaks to a broader issue,"" Graham said in stark contrast to the president’s rhetoric on the turmoil. ""We just need to get to the bottom of what happened and what we can do to fix it. And the answer is pretty obvious: Community policing is the anecdote to this, where there is a sense of community among the police and those that are being policed. I don’t know how to make that a reality but we’ll have a hearing along those lines.""  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin lamented that ""America still lives in the shadows of its original sin: slavery, and the racism that spawned it.""  ""Is our system of justice in America so infected by racism that it cannot function in a manner consistent with our democratic values? That’s as basic as it gets in a democratic society,"" Durbin, D-Illinois, said. ""Is our president mobilizing our military to suppress dissent in a manner inconsistent with the constitution and never seen before in history? That is a question that goes to the very heart of our democracy and our role as an equal branch of government.""  Durbin urged Graham ""not to overlook the fact"" that those questions ""really go to the heart of our democracy"" -- arguing that many other issues the committee plans to examine in the coming days are ""irrelevant.""  The committee has already scheduled oversight hearings with Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general, into Crossfire Hurricane, the code name for the counterintelligence investigation undertaken by the FBI in 2016 and 2017 into links between Trump associates and Russian officials, as well as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s notice and takedown process for copyright holders to get infringing user-uploaded material removed from websites.  ""What is relevant is the question as to how America can be safe and still hold to its democratic values and principles,"" Durbin contended.  Feinstein said the ongoing civil unrest across the country is ""one of those horrible anomalies about life and when it happens it’s so graphic and so real and you can’t control it.""  ""There’s desperate need to bring people together to show the sameness among us, not to illustrate the badness,"" Feinstein, D-Calif., said. ""You had a police officer responsible for the death of a victim and people reacted, but now what has to happen, the message is clearly sent, what has to happen is we should take a look.

The measure, which is non-binding and unlikely to garner sufficient GOP support, explicitly condemns Trump ""for ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against the Americans who were peaceably protesting in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC on the night of June 1, 2020, thereby violating the constitutional rights of those peaceful protestors.""

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. 'When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,' Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. 'We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,' he said. 'It is time to pull people together.' Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John's Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn't mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn't comment about Trump's actions. 'Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. 'His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,' he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. 'Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn't mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,' Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn't be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest.' He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

(KOIN) — Despite a night of peaceful protest in Portland spurred by the death of George Floyd, and despite Mayor Ted Wheeler lifting the citywide curfew, no one is expecting the protests and violence are over. After the main group of peaceful protesters disbanded around midnight, a crowd of about 100 began to throw glass bottles and rocks. A dozen people were arrested by Portland police. Mayor Wheeler announces no new curfew Wheeler asked Gov. Kate Brown for the National Guard to be deployed only to free up PPB officers protect buildings. Brown sent 50 National Guard members but only in an unarmed support role, not involved in crowd control. She also sent 100 Oregon State Police troopers. At a morning press conference, PPB Chief Jamie Resch said, “What we could use and did is use a combination of OSP and National Guard to secure buildings only. That’s only what they did. They were not on the front line and not visible for the most part.” Peaceful Portland protesters seek ‘justice, freedom’ Wheeler: ‘Small handful of rioters hurt our city’ Photos: Protesters number in the thousands on 4th night Video: The voices of the demonstrators The mayor reiterated his request for help was never for the National Guard to have direct confrontation with demonstrators. The Guard reports to OSP, and OSP officials told KOIN 6 News they were involved with shuttling vehicles and personnel. (The governor’s full statement is below) But what if the violence escalates again? For now, Gov. Brown, Mayor Wheeler and Chief Resch all say they do not intend to call out the National Guard for crowd control. They’re concerned that would only escalate the violence. In a statement to KOIN 6 News, the governor’s Deputy Communications Director Charles Boyle said: Over the weekend, the Mayor specifically requested that the Governor mobilize Oregon National Guard members in order to be a visible presence protecting high-profile buildings, including the Justice Center downtown. This request was denied over the weekend and an equal number of additional state police troopers were sent instead. The Mayor and Governor had a difference of opinion about placing soldiers from the Guard at the epicenter of these protests, but they ultimately agreed on the use of state troopers instead. On Monday, a more limited, supporting role for National Guard members was developed. After further discussion and consultation with community leaders, the Governor agreed to this request, which allowed the use of Guard members in a support role––caring for the injured, processing arrests, and directing traffic, for example. Doing this will free up trained law enforcement officers to more directly work with the public and on crowd control. The Mayor and Governor speak frequently, and when they make critical decisions they don’t shy away from honest and sometimes tough back and forth until they come up with a plan of action. In this case, they ultimately agreed on a plan to ensure the safety of Oregonians making their voices heard on critical social justice issues.",0.0

The legislation has drawn criticism that it could allow the central government to take greater control after pro-democracy protests last year, according to AP News. Deliberation is scheduled to begin on May 29 in the National People’s Congress. Spokesman Zhang Yesui said, “Establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard national security.” China could place the draft law into Annex III of Basic Law, by legislator or decree to convert national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong, according to BBC. Hong Kong’s government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law in its constitution, which prohibits any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag according to AP News. The newly-proposed national security and anti-sedition law could reduce many of the fundamental political freedoms and civil liberties guaranteed in the agreement made when the city was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The protests began in June 2019 and lasted until September 2019 over plans that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China, according to BBC. CNN reported Beijing officials argue the law is necessary to prevent violent unrest like last year, and Chinese authorities blamed “foreign forces” for encouraging those protests. BBC also reported Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam, who is a pro-Beijing supporter, said the law will help authorities more in tackling illegal activity in the city. Hong Kong’s last colonial governor, Chris Patten, told Reuters, “You cannot trust [President] Xi Jinping’s China. That’s different from previous administrations. He tightened up as a dictator. He cannot abide anyone who disagrees with him and the Chinese government.” United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has responded to the legislation, stating “the [U.S.] strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties,” according to BBC. AP News reported spokesperson for the U.S. department of state Morgan Ortagus said, “Any effort to impose national security legislation that does not reflect the will of the people of Hong Kong would be highly destabilizing, and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community.” Ortagus added the limitations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by China to Hong Kong will affect “the United States’ current treatment of Hong Kong.” Hong Kong’s number two official, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, told CNN any sanction imposed by the Trump administration on Hong Kong is a “double-edged sword,” as it enjoys a large trade surplus with Hong Kong, “Any sanctions do nobody any good at all. It would hurt Hong Kong but it would doubly hurt the United States.” United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and his Australian and Canadian counterparts also expressed “deep concern” in a joint statement towards China’s proposal, according to BBC. “Making such a law on Hong Kong’s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy.” According to CNN, 300 people were arrested across Hong Kong on Wednesday over the new security law, as sporadic protests were contained by a massive police presence and a zero tolerance approach, with the use of pepper spray and pellets. In the wake of the arrests, former lawmaker and pro-democracy activist Nathan Law told Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK, “It’s like a de facto curfew now,” and added, “I think the government has to understand why people are really angry.”",0.0

The churches want to resume in-person worship as early as May 31. The Oregon Supreme Court is preparing to make a decision on an earlier suit against Brown by Baker County churches, consisting of 10 churches and 20 individuals. The premise of the lawsuit is Brown exceeded her authority when she ordered social distancing because of COVID-19.

On May 18, the website Gateway Pundit, which Facebook says is “known for publishing falsehoods and spreading hoaxes,” published an unverified claim that Oregon officials changed hundreds of Republicans’ ballots to non-partisan, according to The Oregonian. Instead, Oregon state election officials heard an increase in complaints from voters during primary elections who say they received non-partisan ballots when they believed they had registered as Democrat or Republican. Many of these complaints came from people who had been inactive voters for some years and had initially registered as non-partisan. The social media companies agreed to take steps to stop the information.

Portland police declared a riot around midnight as fires were set in the street near Southwest Alder and 4th Avenue.

The protest began peacefully in Peninsula Park before hundreds began marching through downtown to Portland police headquarters outside the Multnomah County Justice Center.

Brown said in a statement via AP News, “in the middle of this pandemic, the continued delays from the Oregon Employment Department in delivering unemployment insurance benefits to thousands of out-of-work Oregonians are unacceptable.” Brown asked for Erickson’s resignation on Sunday. When the pandemic hit, the employment department was quickly overwhelmed, as more than 440,000 Oregonians filed for jobless benefits and the state’s unemployment rate spiked to an all-time high at 14.2%, according to The Oregonian.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has claimed to be empathetic toward Black lives and the call for justice against police violence, but at the same time, he is urging Oregon’s Governor Kate Brown to respond with military force. Time and again, this approach has proven to be an escalation. It should stop. Responding to prodding by the United States Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams, Wheeler has affirmatively acted upon the calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to “dominate” protesters. This kind of response is a violent, angry response to calls for a move toward more humane policing and genuine care and concern for Portland’s Black community. Naturally, this kind of response has a history in the City of Portland. In a starkly similar time and place, Portland’s Albina community, the heart of Portland’s Black community, was racked with protests in 1967 at the same time other Black communities throughout the country were rising up. When police confronted a crowd of predominantly Black activists, the situation escalated into two nights of riots, largely prompted by police presence and rage at the effort to bring in state police and the National Guard. The protests seemed to confirm in the mind of the Portland Development Commission and City Hall that it was time to move forward on plans to level much of the Rose Quarter and Albina, home to Portland’s Black community due to redlining. Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Interstate 5 and Emanuel Hospital dug in, destroying much of the community’s southern half and leaving parking lots and empty lots where homes and businesses once were. The militarized response in Portland’s downtown will not serve to quiet unrest, it will only escalate things. In the end, televising images of a militarized city will not create a sense of peace, nor will it make the city feel safer. Instead, seeing that things are “so bad” that soldiers take up arms, citizens and visitors alike will have a different view of the city. In response to unrest like Albina, the City Club commissioned a report in 1968 that was highly critical of flawed attempts by City Hall to bring genuine relations with the Black community. “Satisfactory police-citizen relations are not likely to be achieved as a reality in Portland,” the report states, “in the absence of a fundamental change in the philosophy of the officials who formulate policy for the police bureau.” While it is true that there has been a change in this philosophy between then and now, it is clearly toward a far more aggressive and militarized response. Successive mayors since the 1960s have claimed to be working toward a peaceful, cooperative effort toward community relations but have spent more and more money on ensuring the police are an increasingly militarized force of stormtroopers. Taxpayer money is spent on shields, pads, guards and weapons of endless sorts, all to ensure the response to any kind of social disorder, from failing to pay MAX fare to loud chanting, are faced with the business end of high-tech weaponry, ranging from “less lethal” rounds that can maim, to actual bullets. We’ve seen how this plays out all over the country. For example, in Louisville, where the exact kind of community liaison police and mayors claim to be seeking, David McAtee, a restaurateur and friendly neighbor, was shot and killed by the Louisville police. His body now, as of writing this, is still laying in the place he was shot. The response to civil unrest, then, seems to increasingly be “kill them all.” It is natural to consider in this kind of situation whether this is a systemic or episodic problem with the police. Does it happen in rare instances of police overstep and in response to social disorder, or is it now the common protocol to simply shoot anyone who dares threaten a heavily-armed officer, even vaguely? In Portland, the answer is the latter. Just last night, Gresham Police, acting as backup to the Portland Police Bureau, shot and killed a man. All while the mayor decries injustice, his finger on the trigger.",0.0

The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would 'move into residential areas' and 'white' neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by white supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: 'It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left.' 'Usually you see this when there's an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,'said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. 'The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.' The theories about antifa "" short for 'anti-fascists' and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations "" have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in 'tips' they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho "" a rural county of 24,000 "" the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn't taper off until the sheriff's office debunked the rumor on Facebook. 'It's really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,' said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. 'When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.' Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had 'no credible information' that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren't aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn't see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. 'Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,' Clemens said. 'It was very specific: there were three busloads.' Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words 'Soros Riot Dance squad' emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don't have any words printed on them. Said Duval: 'It's frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.' ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

According to Eugene police, the protest began with two dozen people at East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street. The group grew in numbers as it marched through the downtown area, chanting ""black lives matter"" and ""say his name, George Floyd."" The group ended at the federal courthouse and after eight minutes of silence for Floyd a white officer’s knee was on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes, 46 seconds the floor was opened up for people of color to speak. One speaker brought up the legacy of Charles Landeros. Landeros was fatally shot January 2019 by Eugene police, which was ruled justified by the Lane County DA, after he pulled a gun on police while being escorted from his child’s school. Andiel Brown, director of Gospel Choirs and Ensembles at the University of Oregon and a former University of Oregon football player, told the Register-Guard he stopped by on his way home from work to make sure someone black spoke to hundreds of mostly white protesters. He told the crowd that the frustration with racism has been building for 400 years. ""What do you expect but a riot?"" Brown said. He cautioned the white protesters, ""but those who are a guest in our struggle don’t get to riot."" Another speaker, Tre Stewart, said he was accepting donations on his Venmo @Stoggrd to help local businesses affected by Saturday’s protest that ended in the vandalism of some properties downtown. Stewart has been livestreaming area protests. After the vigil at the courthouse broke up, groups continued to march and walked through the UO campus and made their way west on Franklin Boulevard. Eugene police put out an advisory, urging motorists to avoid ""the westbound Franklin Boulevard area near Hilyard and toward downtown. There is a large march."" Another evening of protests in Eugene, Oregon. Follow @TatianaSophiaPT and I for updates @registerguard pic.twitter.com/KXRSkSX0Zv — Chris Pietsch (@ChrisPietsch) June 3, 2020 The march ended at Kesey Square in downtown with drumming and dancing. ""The activities tonight appeared well organized and self-regulating,"" Eugene police Chief Chris Skinner said in an emailed news release. ""There were times the march took up roadways, but it was not hugely disruptive. Because of this, there was no need for us to intervene given the way the participants were behaving. I definitely give this group credit for maintaining such large crowds without any issues."" The city did not put a curfew in place Tuesday night as it had on previous nights. By 11:20 p.m., there were about 100 people remaining at Kesey Square, according to the news release. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and saying he couldn’t breathe. The incident was videotaped by bystanders. Floyd's death sparked protests and violence in Minneapolis and in every state around the country. Speakers at Eugene’s latest demonstration said protests would be ongoing and peaceful. Other cities’ responses Portland: The police chief in Portland issued a plea Wednesday to the city’s residents to help its leaders stop the violence that has engulfed the city for five consecutive nights in demonstrations over the death of Floyd. Chief Jami Resch said at a news conference that a peaceful march and rally Tuesday that attracted more than 10,000 people was marred when several hundred people broke off late and confronted police officers guarding a building that holds police headquarters and a sheriff’s detention center. The repeated nights of mayhem have rattled even liberal Portland, which has such a storied history of protest that the late president George H. W. Bush dubbed it ""Little Beirut."" Salem: More than 200 demonstrators met at the Oregon State Capitol on Tuesday evening for a fourth night of protests, the first night that has remained peaceful. Tuesday's event in Salem, led by organizer Jonathan Jones, included participants who sang songs, waved signs, chanted and even danced throughout the evening until crowds disbursed at the 11 p.m. curfew. ""I want (tonight) to be the interlude between the anger,"" Jones said. City of Salem officials extended the curfew for six more nights, from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. through Monday, to help the Salem Police Department maintain public safety and prevent further destruction and violence. Only a handful of people were left standing on the Capitol steps after 11 p.m. Salem officers asked remaining individuals to move along. There were no arrests made by Salem Police as of 11:15 p.m. Seattle: Large crowds marched through the city and demonstrations were mostly peaceful until late in the night, when Seattle police used tear gas and flash-bang grenades to disperse a crowd near a police precinct. Seattle police say some people in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood began throwing objects at officers. There were no immediate reports of arrests. On Tuesday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed hundreds of demonstrators and encouraged them to keep marching and keep it peaceful. ""Your voices holding me accountable are important and you should continue to raise them,"" Durkan told those assembled outside the city’s Emergency Operations Center downtown. Durkan and protest leaders planned to meet Wednesday.

1623805602,2020-06-02 03:00:00,"Court docs shed light on Portland protests, riots, looting",http://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/468936-379671-court-docs-shed-light-on-portland-protests-riots-looting-,en,False,,1392,canby herald,http://canbyherald.com/,"Court docs shed light on Portland protests, riots, looting Multnomah DA says more than 100 arrested in five nights of George Floyd protests in downtown Portland. About 100 people have been arrested during five nights of protests in downtown Portland — with most released from jail within hours and court documents filed in only about a quarter of cases. The Multnomah County district attorney's office says it has not reviewed every case yet, as only 27 have appeared on the circuit court docket. ""We will initiate a criminal case following a review of all available evidence and whenever legally and ethically appropriate,"" according to a statement provided by Brent Weisberg, the DA's spokesman. But a review of the available court records shows that county prosecutors are focusing their efforts on those accused of violence, setting fires or looting. Probable cause affidavits — an indicator that district attorneys are seriously pursuing the case — have only been submitted in five cases reviewed by the Tribune, though one affidavit lists four defendants. It is not uncommon for criminal cases in Multnomah County to never reach the affidavit stage, because prosecutors drop the charges, a plea deal has already been reached, the case is being handled by social services or the defendant waives their right to an immediate filing. Records from juvenile cases are automatically sealed unless released by a judge. Here's what prosecutors have alleged in some of the court records so far: • Richard Clay Cavanaugh of Portland; Kiara Demarro Burns, homeless per records; Ada Marie McGraw, a transient per record; and Shane Jay Anderson of Portland, face charges after allegedly being caught looting Bait, an apparel and shoe store across from Pioneer Square on Broadway early in the morning on May 30. Cavanaugh, 18, was allegedly caught by officers with his arms full of merchandise. Anderson, 40, and Burns, 31, were also found inside the store, which had smashed windows. McGraw, 32, was found hiding in the bathroom. Inside McGraw's car officers allegedly found items from the Beaver Store, GNC and a dispensary which all reported being looted that night. All four remain in custody. • The roommate of Amelia Joan Shamrowicz, 25, of Portland, is said to have contacted authorities to report Shamrowicz had allegedly thrown a Molotov cocktail into the Chase Bank on the ground floor of a 11-story building on Southwest Sixth Avenue after breaking the window with a piece of metal. The damage caused by the fire has been estimated at $1,000. ""Shamrowicz was reported to be extremely excited about being labeled a terrorist and was very animated about her hopes that police officers would be killed,"" prosecutors wrote. Shamrowicz has denied setting the fire. She remains behind bars. • Anthony Nichola Leuci, 35, homeless per court records, allegedly charged officers on May 31, inflicting a ""haymaker"" blow to the helmeted head of an Officer Sanders. Leuci was then tackled and arrested by four officers. He remains behind bars. • Patrick W. Hill, 49, a transient per records, was arrested May 30 near the federal courthouse after police alleged he punched Officer Michelle Petty in the head. Hill remains in custody downtown. • Peter Riley Lent, 21, no address listed, is accused of burning a newspaper box on May 30. He remains in custody. Local authorities have gone to strenuous lengths to differentiate between peaceful protesters and those engaging in unlawful activity. On multiple nights, protesters have gathered for hours without major incident, often shouting out ""peaceful protest"" when fireworks go off or projectiles are thrown by someone in the crowd. On Monday night, June 1, the demonstration was only broken up after the vast majority of the column had marched off. That has led some of the city's anonymous antifa accounts to call for stronger action as soon as Tuesday night, June 2.    To be clear, it is absolutely okay to not be down with vandalism or property destruction, many of us are scared and uncomfortable when it happens. THAT'S VALID!  But it's NEVER okay to work with and talk to kkkops. EVER. It endangers our friends, our allies, our whole community. — DirectActionAlliance (@DirectActionPDX) June 2, 2020 Most people who are booked at the downtown jail are released soon after because the county jail system's 1,192 beds are essentially always at capacity. Authorities don't often hold someone on misdemeanor charges if it means releasing someone awaiting trial for more serious offenses. The DA says most arrested will be arraigned in seven to nine weeks due to the public health emergency. On social media, those sympathetic to the larger protest movement have argued that the Friday night riots and subsequent civil disturbances have purposely avoided small and locally owned businesses, though eyewitness accounts by the Tribune paint a more complicated picture. Among local businesses whose damages included at least broken windows (if not stolen merchandise) are Portland Luggage, Barista coffee shop, Killer Burger, Mary's Jewelry, Jewelry & Loan Company, Artistic Portland, America's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses, Bangkok Palace, U.S. Outdoor, Packouz Jewelers, a dispensary, a convenience store, a liquor store and others. Many national corporations were also caught in the destruction, including at least four banks, the flagship Apple store, a nearby Microsoft store, retailers inside Pioneer Place mall, Starbucks, and others.",0.0

About Race The now-ended Panoply podcast starring Anna Holmes, Baratunde Thurston, Raquel Cepeda, and Tanner Colby, ""about the ways we can't talk, don't talk, would rather not talk, but intermittently, fitfully, embarrassingly talk about culture, identity, politics, power, and privilege.""

Pod Save the People Activist and organizer DeRay McKesson's popular social justice and politics podcast on the Crooked Media network, with co-hosts Brittany Packnett Cunningham, Sam Sinyangwe, and Dr. Clint Smith. Things to Watch The Black Power Mixtape: 1967-1975 Director/writer Göran Olsson admits his film isn’t comprehensive, but his outsider’s perspective lends a piquant slant unavailable to American filmmakers. He devotes almost as much time to ordinary black citizens dealing with injustice, drugs, and poverty as he does to leaders like Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, and Eldridge Cleaver, making us realize that Black people’s grievances resonate as urgently today as they did 40 years ago. DAVE SEGAL Selma Director Ava DuVernay's willingness to engage with this particularly American history of violence sets Selma apart—portraying a movement on film is an impossible task, but if DuVernay has succeeded, it's in the way Selma forces a kind of reckoning for its viewer. MEGAN BURBANK I Am Not Your Negro In 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his next project—a revolutionary, personal account of the lives and assassinations of three of his close friends: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. At the time of Baldwin's death in 1987, he left behind only 30 completed pages of this manuscript. Filmmaker Raoul Peck envisions the book James Baldwin never finished. Fruitvale Station Oscar Grant was the unarmed 22-year-old black man who was shot to death by a transit cop in an Oakland train station—Fruitvale Station—on January 1, 2009. At trial, the officer convinced the jury that he mistook his gun for a Taser. Convicted of involuntary manslaughter, he served 11 months and was home before the year was out. In a way, Grant himself is on trial in Fruitvale Station, humanized compassionately yet unflinchingly on the big screen. But ultimately, you need only ask yourself: Why does this man have to prove he doesn't deserve to be killed? In our culture, who has to prove themselves and who doesn't? JEN GRAVES Why Aren't There More Black People in Oregon? A Hidden History A filmed 2014 presentation at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art by PSU adjunct professor and writer Walidah Imarisha, covering aspects of Oregon history not taught in local schools, a history steeped in Black exclusion and discrimination, answering the question ""Why Aren't There More Black People in Oregon?"" If Beale Street Could Talk Moonlight director Barry Jenkins' masterful adaptation of James Baldwin's novel perfectly captures how macro issues—particularly the rigged systems that work against Black people in America—affect one family like shuddering, foundation-shaking aftershocks. ROBERT HAM Queen & Slim Queen & Slim may be the best—and is almost certainly the Blackest—film of 2019, and is perhaps most poignant for its gorgeous, complex, and multifaceted portrayal of the Black experience, where sparks of joy and love exist alongside pain, struggle, and oppression; a new American romance/drama written in the Black American language, told via a fully Black lens, and including a diverse array of characters who show that Black people are not a monolith. JENNI MOORE Arresting Power Making good use of rare (and expensive) archival footage from the Oregon Historical Society, the local documentary Arresting Power is at its strongest when telling the origin story of Portland’s police accountability movement—providing potent evidence that the marches and demands for change that erupted post-Ferguson are part of a decades-long tradition started by our city’s African American community. Many of those leaders also appear on camera, sharing their wisdom alongside testimonials from community members like Shirley Isadore, whose daughter Kendra James was killed by Portland police in 2003. It’s a good primer for anyone who cares about accountability. DENIS C. THERIAULT When They See Us Ava DuVernay's award-winning Netflix miniseries about the injustices visited upon Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana Jr., Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam, and their eventual exoneration. DuVernay's media company and arts collective ARRAY has released a learning guide for families and educators to use when watching the miniseries with children. Blindspotting In rapidly gentrifying Oakland, Collin (Daveed Diggs) is trying to survive his last three days of probation when the slightest infraction will send him back to jail. However, his best friend Miles (Rafael Casal) is white, wild, and reckless. Collin should avoid Miles, but he doesn’t. While trying to get home before curfew late one night, he witnesses a rogue cop pursue and shoot a fleeing black man. CARL SPENCE Priced Out Cornelius Swart’s Priced Out assembles a wealth of information about the history of gentrification in the Black neighborhoods of North and Northeast Portland. This film is a follow-up to NorthEast Passage, a documentary Swart, a longtime reporter, co-produced in 2002; that film's central figure, Nikki Williams, spoke in favor of gentrification. Priced Out juxtaposes Williams’ current perspective with the recent developments that have turned several Portland neighborhoods into playgrounds for white newcomers. It’s as fascinating to watch as it is devastating to comprehend. SUZETTE SMITH The Murder of Fred Hampton In the late '60s, Fred Hampton became one of the most powerful voices in the Black activist movement, rising to the ranks of deputy chairman of the Black Panther Party and helping found the Rainbow Coalition, a multicultural group that united a disparate batch of Chicago community groups all fighting on behalf of civil rights and racial equality. So powerful that he was deemed a radical and was killed in a raid of his apartment by the Chicago police and the FBI. Director Howard Alk's 1971 documentary, offered up for streaming via Portland's Church of Film, is a damning expose into Hampton's death and an unforgettable portrait of his short but deeply impactful life.

Blair Stenvick Due to the dangerous situation and loss of control exhibited by the Portland Police, we have pulled our reporters off the street for the night. It's simply too dangerous for them to be out there right now. We'll continue to monitor the situation and update you tomorrow. TO RECAP: The evening started out extremely uplifting with an estimated 10,000 people protesting in Portland to end police brutality, many marching across the Burnside Bridge and meeting up with thousands more downtown at Pioneer Square. At the 10 pm hour things went sideways when protesters, marching to the fenced Justice Center were gassed from the front and the rear by police. Our reporters were among the hundreds affected, many of whom were innocent bystanders. The majority of the crowd marched out of town, while roughly 1,000 protesters returned to the Justice Center. After a 30 minute standoff, police claimed that some sort of projectiles were thrown at them, sending them into tear gassing fury, throwing gas canisters at any random grouping that was in range. In short, this was FAR MORE gas than has been used during this series of protests, and under FAR LESS provocation. In short, the Portland Police department lost their shit tonight, and there will be many questions to be answered tomorrow. Thank you all for joining us tonight, and I especially thank our on-the-ground reporters Alex Zielinski and Blair Stenvick who were insanely brave, even while being gassed by police more than once. If you appreciate their dedication to keeping Portland informed, I hope you will consider donating to keep their work going at the Portland Mercury. They certainly deserve your support. We'll see you in the morning.  THREAD: The OJRC strongly condemns tonight’s actions by the City of Portland and Portland Police Bureau.

Here's what we currently know from this confusing scene. A breakaway group of protesters headed toward the Justice Center which had been fenced off since yesterday. Cops warned them to stay away from the fence at 4th and Taylor, and while it's currently unclear what set everything off (possibly someone shaking the fence?), according to our Alex Zielinski, riot police came up from behind and launched tear gas—effectively trapping the protesters (and our reporters) between the gas and fence. This meant protesters were forced to run through clouds of smoke to escape. — Alex Zielinski (@alex_zee) June 3, 2020 They got Blair, too.

""This protest is a 100 percent peaceful protest. We’re not here for violence... we’re here to show the world we can be better than those who do incite violence.” If the past two nights have been any indication, the crowds have been increasingly vigilant in policing the very few agitators among their ranks. In my reporting on the street, I've personally witnessed many immediate smack-downs applied to anyone trying to throw anything at the cops, or causing any sort of unwanted commotion. Hopefully this trend continues. One thing Blair neglected to mention... THERE'S A LLAMA THERE? (But... of course there is, right?)

You can catch up on all of our on-the-ground reporting with these links: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. And you'll find related protest content here. HERE'S THE LATEST: While last night was the most peaceful of the week's protests that will be remembered for the thousands gathered in Pioneer Square and later taking a knee while taking the Burnside Bridge, around midnight 100 or so protesters clashed with cops downtown where water bottles were thrown, tear gas was dispersed, and arrests were made. Also in the periphery, cracks are beginning to show within the resistance movement where a disagreement over who should be leading has begun—which we're keeping an eye on. The big difference? No curfew tonight, according to Mayor Ted Wheeler who seems to be coming around to the idea that heavy-handed tactics are producing the opposite effect to what he had been hoping. Tonight will probably show whether his newfound light touch will prevail. Tonight's protest will start where last night's began: at the field next to Revolution Hall (13th & Stark) at 6 pm which organizers say will continue with a march to Pioneer Square. Where it goes from there, and what will happen remains to be seen—but the Mercury will be there, starting with our own Blair Stenvick who will follow the rally at Rev Hall, and our Alex Zielinski who's stationed at Pioneer Square. Follow 'em on Twitter for the moment-by-moment updates, and this post for an overview of the evening. So saddle up, Portland! This is your protest liveblog for the evening, and as the marchers like to say, ""STAY TIGHT. STAY TOGETHER."" Stay tuned for more.",0.0
1623834639,2020-06-02 21:22:00,Large George Floyd Demonstrations Begin For First Time Without Portland Curfew,https://www.opb.org/news/article/george-floyd-demonstrations-protests-portland/,en,False,,1409,kopb,http://www.opb.org/,"UPDATE (11:16 p.m. PT) — Calls for Oregon leaders to meaningfully address systemic racism and police brutality continued Tuesday with a fifth night of widespread demonstrations in Portland. Eric Slade/OPB Several thousand people gathered across the city, congregating near Revolution Hall, Pioneer Courthouse Square and the Burnside Bridge as the protests began. It was a continuation of national protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, who killed Floyd on Memorial Day by restricting his airflow for nearly nine minutes. Tuesday’s was the first major demonstration without a curfew in place, as Portland leaders acknowledged earlier in the day that the restriction had done little to deter people from protesting. At the beginning of the evening, demonstrations seemed to aim for a similar format to the overwhelmingly peaceful march that took place Monday. Protesters gathered to hear speeches before marching through downtown. At one point, people covered nearly the entire Burnside Bridge as they laid down, hands behind their back, for nine minutes in memory of Floyd. The massive crowd packed into Pioneer Courthouse Square after 8 p.m. and listened to music and more speeches. Among the speakers was Joe Bean Keller, whose son Deonte Keller was killed by Portland police officer Terry Kruger in 1996 during a traffic stop. Keller said his son did not receive medical treatment for more than an hour after being shot “because a dead witness is the best witness.” “But we’re not having that no more … we have the proof in our hands,” Keller said, referring to cellphone footage like that of Floyd’s death that has outraged Americans. Kruger went on to become chief of the West Linn Police Department, but was placed on administrative leave in April as several investigations were launched into officers who had discriminated against and wrongfully arrested Michael Fesser, a Black man, in February 2017. “Sometimes it takes patience and time for our prayers to be answered,” Keller told the massive crowd Tuesday. Around 9:15 p.m., Portland police fired tear gas, flash bangs and other crowd control measures after people had gathered at a fence blocking off access to areas that had been hardest hit by vandalism in previous nights’ protests. Officers fired tear gas directly into large groups of protesters, splitting them into smaller groups as people fled the noxious fumes. PPB then declared the demonstration an unlawful assembly, said criminal behavior was happening and ordered people to leave downtown. The Oregon Justice Resource Center swiftly condemned police actions, calling the use of tear gas and other measures against protesters “reprehensible.” “The actions of our City and State reveal the incredible levels of willful ignorance in Oregon around police violence and the enormity of the racial justice issues we are facing,” the nonprofit legal group said in a statement. Speaking at a Tuesday morning press conference, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler noted that until he and other leaders take action to address systemic problems that have resulted in the deaths of Black Americans, demonstrations are likely to continue. Wheeler said he was still determining what those actions should be. “I don’t see how we move out of this current mode of thinking — which is large demonstrations demanding justice — until we get to the OK, we’ve now heard it, we’ve acknowledged it, so what concrete actions are we taking next? And I want to hear more from the community about what they think we should do,” Wheeler said. Meanwhile, state lawmakers of color defined some of their goals for the upcoming legislative session Tuesday. State Sen. Lew Frederick said the Oregon Legislature’s People of Color Caucus will be focused on police accountability when lawmakers meet next. Frederick said the first pieces of legislation would be focused on ensuring disciplinary actions for officers who commit misconduct, independent oversight of investigations when law enforcement kills someone, and a work group to look at state laws around the use of force.",0.0

Thousands gathered at Revolution Hall at 6 p.m. before marching across the Willamette River on the Burnside Bridge, where they eventually congregated at Pioneer Courthouse Square for hours of speeches and demonstration. Organizers eventually led the column back onto the east side as the rally entered its fifth hour; that's when a smaller group of black-clad anti-fascists known as antifa approached police roadblocks. ""It appears that most people from the group downtown have dispersed. Officers made some arrests after glass bottles and rocks were thrown at them,"" police said around 1 a.m. on Tuesday, June 2.

This is extremely dangerous... — PNW Youth Liberation Front (@PNWYLF) June 2, 2020 Read our previous reporting below: Portland braced for the fourth straight night of protests on Monday, June 1. Portland Police Bureau announced the closure of a four-by-four square of city blocks — from Southwest 1st Avenue to 5th Avenue, and from Southwest Taylor Street to Jefferson Street — around 3:20 p.m. Police said the emergency closure would halt all vehicle and pedestrian traffic into the area containing the Multnomah County Justice Center and federal courthouse. ""The closure of this area is due to ongoing public safety concerns and ongoing criminal acts,"" police said. ""Violations of this order may result in arrest."" Police asked protesters to gather at Waterfront Park instead. Demonstrations were planned in the Buckman neighborhood near Revolution Hall and at Northeast 57th Avenue at Sandy Boulevard during the day. TriMet said it was routing buses and trains out of a 16-block area in downtown at 4 p.m. Mayor Ted Wheeler has extended the 8 p.m. city-wide curfew to continue to be in effect on Monday, and Gov. Kate Brown announced that around 50 unarmed National Guard troops would be deployed to protect facilities.

Protests have taken place around the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. Police forces have used tear gas to disperse protesters in many of these protests. Some social media users have wondered if tear gas could spread or exacerbate COVID-19. THE QUESTION Can tear gas spread COVID-19? THE ANSWER: Yes. Exposure to tear gas leads to coughing and sneezing -- both spread respiratory droplets. Exposure also leads to touching the face. All of these can increase the chance of infection. WHAT WE FOUND The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website explains the effects of riot control agents, also known as tear gas, as “chemical compounds that make people temporarily unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs and skin.” Both the CDC and Healthline say the severity of symptoms can depend on the exposure to it being on an open or enclosed space, the amount of tear gas, the proximity to it or whether you have a preexisting health condition. The VERIFY team contacted Dr. Payal Kohli, KUSA’s medical correspondent, and she said that tear gas “can actually help facilitate the spread because it can lead to coughing, sneezing and shouting which spreads droplets and tearing (some reports say that tears can spread the virus) and touching of the face. So spraying this into crowds during a pandemic may not be the best idea.” When it comes to the possibility of tear gas affecting someone’s response to COVID-19, the doctor clarified that there’s not enough evidence to support that but it is an efficient way to help spread the virus as “it leads to more respiratory droplets being emitted,” Kohli said. The doctor made clear that public events like demonstrations and protests are ""super spreaders,"" and recommends people to wear masks, a form of eye protection, long sleeves, to not wear makeup or contacts, maintain social distancing and to carry hand sanitizer.",0.0

Things to Watch The Black Power Mixtape: 1967-1975 Director/writer Göran Olsson admits his film isn’t comprehensive, but his outsider’s perspective lends a piquant slant unavailable to American filmmakers. He devotes almost as much time to ordinary black citizens dealing with injustice, drugs, and poverty as he does to leaders like Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, and Eldridge Cleaver, making us realize that Black people’s grievances resonate as urgently today as they did 40 years ago. DAVE SEGAL Selma Director Ava DuVernay's willingness to engage with this particularly American history of violence sets Selma apart—portraying a movement on film is an impossible task, but if DuVernay has succeeded, it's in the way Selma forces a kind of reckoning for its viewer. MEGAN BURBANK I Am Not Your Negro In 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his next project—a revolutionary, personal account of the lives and assassinations of three of his close friends: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. At the time of Baldwin's death in 1987, he left behind only 30 completed pages of this manuscript. Filmmaker Raoul Peck envisions the book James Baldwin never finished. Fruitvale Station Oscar Grant was the unarmed 22-year-old black man who was shot to death by a transit cop in an Oakland train station—Fruitvale Station—on January 1, 2009. At trial, the officer convinced the jury that he mistook his gun for a Taser. Convicted of involuntary manslaughter, he served 11 months and was home before the year was out. In a way, Grant himself is on trial in Fruitvale Station, humanized compassionately yet unflinchingly on the big screen. But ultimately, you need only ask yourself: Why does this man have to prove he doesn't deserve to be killed? In our culture, who has to prove themselves and who doesn't? JEN GRAVES Why Aren't There More Black People in Oregon? A Hidden History A filmed 2014 presentation at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art by PSU adjunct professor and writer Walidah Imarisha, covering aspects of Oregon history not taught in local schools, a history steeped in Black exclusion and discrimination, answering the question ""Why Aren't There More Black People in Oregon?"" If Beale Street Could Talk Moonlight director Barry Jenkins' masterful adaptation of James Baldwin's novel perfectly captures how macro issues—particularly the rigged systems that work against Black people in America—affect one family like shuddering, foundation-shaking aftershocks. ROBERT HAM Queen & Slim Queen & Slim may be the best—and is almost certainly the Blackest—film of 2019, and is perhaps most poignant for its gorgeous, complex, and multifaceted portrayal of the Black experience, where sparks of joy and love exist alongside pain, struggle, and oppression; a new American romance/drama written in the Black American language, told via a fully Black lens, and including a diverse array of characters who show that Black people are not a monolith. JENNI MOORE Arresting Power Making good use of rare (and expensive) archival footage from the Oregon Historical Society, the local documentary Arresting Power is at its strongest when telling the origin story of Portland’s police accountability movement—providing potent evidence that the marches and demands for change that erupted post-Ferguson are part of a decades-long tradition started by our city’s African American community. Many of those leaders also appear on camera, sharing their wisdom alongside testimonials from community members like Shirley Isadore, whose daughter Kendra James was killed by Portland police in 2003. It’s a good primer for anyone who cares about accountability. DENIS C. THERIAULT When They See Us Ava DuVernay's award-winning Netflix miniseries about the injustices visited upon Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana Jr., Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam, and their eventual exoneration. DuVernay's media company and arts collective ARRAY has released a learning guide for families and educators to use when watching the miniseries with children. Blindspotting In rapidly gentrifying Oakland, Collin (Daveed Diggs) is trying to survive his last three days of probation when the slightest infraction will send him back to jail. However, his best friend Miles (Rafael Casal) is white, wild, and reckless. Collin should avoid Miles, but he doesn’t. While trying to get home before curfew late one night, he witnesses a rogue cop pursue and shoot a fleeing black man. CARL SPENCE Priced Out Cornelius Swart’s Priced Out assembles a wealth of information about the history of gentrification in the Black neighborhoods of North and Northeast Portland. This film is a follow-up to NorthEast Passage, a documentary Swart, a longtime reporter, co-produced in 2002; that film's central figure, Nikki Williams, spoke in favor of gentrification. Priced Out juxtaposes Williams’ current perspective with the recent developments that have turned several Portland neighborhoods into playgrounds for white newcomers. It’s as fascinating to watch as it is devastating to comprehend. SUZETTE SMITH The Murder of Fred Hampton In the late '60s, Fred Hampton became one of the most powerful voices in the Black activist movement, rising to the ranks of deputy chairman of the Black Panther Party and helping found the Rainbow Coalition, a multicultural group that united a disparate batch of Chicago community groups all fighting on behalf of civil rights and racial equality. So powerful that he was deemed a radical and was killed in a raid of his apartment by the Chicago police and the FBI. Director Howard Alk's 1971 documentary, offered up for streaming via Portland's Church of Film, is a damning expose into Hampton's death and an unforgettable portrait of his short but deeply impactful life.

Among those arrested: A high school senior who isn’t in school because of the coronavirus pandemic, two school bus drivers left unemployed because of the recession, two part-time workers for Fred Meyer and Amazon, five people who are homeless and an out-of-work restaurant cook who was described by a court interviewer as “very polite and respectful,” according to a review of court documents by The Oregonian/OregonLive. It remains difficult to draw broad conclusions about the arrests. The Portland Police Bureau’s early morning news releases frequently misstated the charges and ages of those involved. Police reports and court records describing the allegations in detail aren’t yet available. It’s also unclear whether prosecutors will pursue criminal charges against all of those arrested. More than half of the people were accused of interfering with a police officer, a misdemeanor, according to police statements and court documents. The other most frequently cited crimes by police or listed in court records are curfew violations (either a misdemeanor or fine), felony riot and felony burglary. “As police reports are submitted and received, the District Attorney’s Office will continue to review any potential violation of the law in a thorough manner and if warranted, follow the appropriate charging procedures as outlined under Oregon law,” District Attorney spokesman Brent Weisberg said in response to written questions. It’s unclear how authorities will pursue charges for violating the 8 p.m. curfew established by Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. City officials have said violators could face a fine of up to $500 or a misdemeanor prosecution. Weisberg said prosecutors would decide whether to pursue individual criminal curfew charges, and a timeline for making decisions will vary. It isn’t clear if someone who isn’t charged with a misdemeanor curfew crime could still face a civil fine. About half of Portland’s arrests are not yet accessible in the state’s electronic court system to corroborate the crimes cited by police. The Oregonian/OregonLive found at least 10 instances where the crimes listed by police did not match what had been entered into court records. The Portland Police Bureau did not immediately response to a request for comment. Based on information disclosed by police or in court records, the average age of those arrested was 25 years old, with a median of about 23. On average, the typical person arrested has been accused of about two crimes. There’s no indication that people arrested in the demonstrations Friday through Sunday are from outside Oregon or Southwest Washington. Among 32 cases with available court records listing addresses, 23 had Portland addresses, four are from Vancouver, two are from Gresham, one is from Beaverton and one is from Oregon City. Only one person disclosed a California address. Another person said he arrived in Portland only recently. That individual, a 35-year-old man, told a court interviewer he drove from Arizona a few days ago and is living in his car. The man said he has schizophrenia and isn’t taking his medication, according to court records. Among the 32 cases listed in court records with addresses and other information, 25 men and seven women were arrested. Authorities listed 21 of those people as white, seven black, three Hispanic and one Asian. Portland police said they arrested 16 people associated with Monday night’s demonstrations, which were described as largely peaceful. That pushed total arrests during the four days to more than 90. Demonstrators have been marching in Portland, and across the country, since last week in response to the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. A white police officer who kept his knee pressed to Floyd’s neck for minutes, as the black man repeatedly said he could not breathe, has been charged by prosecutors with murder. Portland’s mayor on Tuesday noted a “significant shift” in the tone of protests Monday night and said he would not extend the citywide curfew Tuesday evening. -- Brad Schmidt; bschmidt@oregonian.com; 503-294-7628; @_brad_schmidt Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.",0.0

What starts to hurt me is when you speak towards why we are angry and the systemic pieces of it, and statistics. And then you act on ways that compromises me more than you as an ally, that is when it gets scary for me,” Machar said.Machar condemned the vandalism that occurred during Monday night’s protest that led to the arrests of 23 people.“That does not represent us. Because that act had nothing to do with what we were trying to say nor did it come from our community or members of our community,” Machar said. “There are people in the crowd throwing bottles that were not part of the protest, part of the voice, but it's always going to be the black violence, because that is a stereotype. Again, that is why we are here. That is why we are in the streets to combat these narratives,” Machar said.The Rev. Kenneth Lewis said he was up until 2:30 a.m. Tuesday in contact with community leaders like Machar to see ways that he could help.Lewis was a teenager during Boston’s desegregation policies and forced bussing.“I want to be very clear, a protester is not a rioter. A protester is not a looter. A protester is someone who stands for a cause and something and wants to be heard,” Lewis said.Machar said the dismantling of Monday night’s message is a strategy of oppression and said there is a responsibility of the police department to of representation in its precincts and not make assumptions on what organizers would like for change.“I really want the black community to feel like they are going, not only in the streets, but you are willing to take us now to a meeting room, to certain tables to speak about how we can make a difference together,” Machar said.Lewis said he sees his role as lending a voice and experience to younger community organizers like Machar.",0.0

Courtesy of Wikiquote Late last night and early this morning, a flood of black squares filled my Instagram feed. The posts were part of Blackout Tuesday, a ""social media movement"" (a.k.a. chainmail) meant to visually symbolize a moment of silence taken in honor of George Floyd, a Black man killed by Minneapolis police, and express solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. These posts quickly became counterproductive—many users included #BlackLivesMatter in their caption, flooding the hashtag with blacked-out posts. People who were using the hashtag to communicate about bail funds and other important protest information suddenly drowned in a sea of well-meaning non-Black people posting about not posting. This then prompted a wave of Black Lives Matter organizers and other users on both Twitter and Instagram asking to remove #BlackLivesMatter from the posts. Here is St. Louis activist Kenidra Woods demonstrating the problem: It has come to my attention that many allies are using #BlackLivesMatter hashtag w black image on insta. We know that’s it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message. We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!! pic.twitter.com/eG2fPaybNW — Kenidra4Humanity ~ BLACK LIVES MATTER ~ (@KenidraRWoods_) June 2, 2020 The call to amplify Black voices and movements turned into non-Black people amplifying their own willing silence. At best, the black squares represent a virtue signaling attempt at showing solidarity with Black people. Posting a square along with a hashtag is a surefire way to associate your brand with the radical work Black people are doing on the ground. But, ultimately, the confusion around Blackout Tuesday is an example of how, despite our best intentions, Instagram is extremely manipulative and primed to exploit misunderstanding to everyone's detriment. Originally, Blackout Tuesday was meant to target the music industry specifically, asking major players and labels to cease operations for one day to protest police brutality against Black people. Started by Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, two black women music executives, they intended to hold an industry that profits from Black art accountable for their (lack of) support of Black lives. Using #TheShowMustBePaused, the women listed a plan of action as well as bail funds and petitions for those looking to help out. But the movement quickly picked up momentum both inside and outside the industry, surpassing the organizers' original intentions and morphing into an endless black grid of posts on Instagram. It's still unclear exactly how their specific campaign turned into users posting black squares on their accounts under #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackoutTuesday. Though, we'd do well to remember that Instagram is owned by the Grand Daddy of Misinformation and Viral Posts—Facebook. Russian troll accounts used the social media site to spread discord and disinformation in the lead up to the 2016 election, creating social justice Facebook groups such as ""Black Matters U and ""Don't Shoot Us"" to increase tensions online. A part of me wonders if the momentum behind #BlackoutTuesday that ended up obscuring Black Lives Matter information channels was part of some sort of troll strategy, Russian or otherwise. While Twitter still suffers problems with misinformation and Black bot accounts, it's much more apt for posting and resharing news and organizing content than Instagram. My advice for non-Black people looking to help would be to continue to amplify the voices of Black people and organizers during this time, opening your purse, and remembering social media sites like Instagram aren't working for you, but against you.

Omari Salisbury / phloating_man on Reddit [The following was originally posted in Seattle's The Stranger.—eds] You’ve probably seen the video by now: A line of protesters faces a line of cops on Seattle's Capitol Hill, an eye-catching purple umbrella held toward police as a shield. There’s no sign of aggression until a cop decides he wants the umbrella; there’s a short tussle; and then the police let loose the chemical agents against the crowd. As they spray, other protestors hold up shields of their own, which the cops dart forward to try to grab as well. But most of those shields are just out of reach, allowing a small group of protestors to remain on the south side of the street. In similar protests against state violence around the world, shields have emerged as an important mechanism to keep people safe from security forces—so let’s take a look at how other protestors have shielded themselves and others. Umbrellas seem to be the most ubiquitous and effective means of protection, provided that the people wielding them stay out of melee range. In particular, umbrellas became a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong in 2014, and remained in steady use through the protests of 2019. They’re cheap, lightweight, and it’s easy to carry several of them or hand them off. Hong Kong’s protesters developed a system of hand signals to indicate that umbrellas, hard hats, and other supplies were needed on the front lines of a protest, and created human chains to quickly deliver them. In some locations, a larger supply of items was kept at the back of the crowd and passed from person to person to the front, with runners carrying them for the last stretch. If an umbrella was snatched by police seeking to do harm, another was quickly put in its place. Other actions have involved shields made of … let’s say sturdier materials. In Kiev, citizens wielded large metal sheets with handles affixed to the back, allowing them to block rubber bullets. (For something more light-weight, cosplayers will tell you it’s easy to make a shield out of a garbage can lid and cabinet handle.) They also erected nets over police barricades, blocking stun grenades. As in Hong Kong, many came prepared with helmets. In Chile, protesters came with whatever they could to protest human rights abuses: A kitchen sink to deflect bullets, street signs, cardboard boxes, and sheets of plywood. One protester became known as “Pare Man” or “Captain Pare” after he was photographed shielding himself with a stop sign, along with a street dog named Matapacos who was hostile to riot police. There’s rain in the forecast for this coming weekend. But you never know when you might need an umbrella.",0.0

Wm. Steven Humphrey Hey good friends, Last night was Sunday, May 31, and I along with a couple thousand others were out on the street in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center. I was covering the rally to remember George Floyd and end police brutality, because a) sure, that’s my job, b) our small staff is severely overworked, and c) I’m in the give-a-crap club. I’ve adored Portland from the moment I arrived, and while our current hellscape seems to be inexplicably getting even worse, being out there with you last night reminded me how much I adore you. Look, I know how the media can misrepresent protests—and while the Mercury tries to avoid it, even we fall into time-worn traps of focusing on the result of destruction (broken windows, looting) rather than the cause (economic and racial disparity, an unnecessarily-militarized police force). So I want to take a moment to describe something I saw last night that doesn’t fall into that narrative. It was around 11:30 pm, and I (and at least a thousand more) had been gassed, flash-banged, and chased around the downtown corridor for hours. We had returned to the Justice Center, and the crowd was overwhelmingly polite. In fact, every single time I saw someone act out—trying to distribute fireworks, toss water bottles at cops—they were immediately shut down by fellow protesters. In any case, late in the evening something happened that made the cops nervous, and once again flash bangs flew, and tear gas filled the air. The majority of the crowd was forced back into the downtown area, though one small group didn’t move. They were nose-to-nose with a line of riot cops on the south side of the building, just out of distance from the gas. I didn’t run, because they didn’t. I really didn’t expect what I saw—a line of protesters calmly talking to the cops and each other. “We are peaceful.” “Remember the name of George Floyd.” “It’s okay—you don’t need those riot suits.” “We’re here to honor and protect people of color.” When new people wandered up, they were immediately told that this space was peaceful—this tiny oasis of calm as gas hovered in the air, and police sirens blared—and anyone who intended to cause trouble was not welcome. And for the first time all evening, I felt safe. Even while I was six feet away from a riot cop’s baton. That's when a cop car suddenly sped by, loudspeaker blaring. “This is an unlawful demonstration….” Our heads jerked around and suddenly the tension ratcheted up tenfold. Looking at the faces of these unarmed protesters who were mere inches away from a line of police dressed in military gear, I was reminded that for too many people in this nation, the feeling of safety—that I as a white person take for granted—is an illusion. And yet these words pulled us back in. “We are de-escalating.” “We are peaceful.” “George Floyd.” “Breonna Taylor.” “Ahmaud Arbery.” ""We're united."" It was reverential. It was certainly as close to being in church as I can remember, even as it felt like the world around us was crumbling. There were a lot of scenes like this last night—of people passing out water, picking up trash, offering emotional support, helping wash tear gas out of the eyes of a Mercury reporter. These are important stories to share, and to do that, we need eyes on the street and especially your support. Due to the COVID pandemic, we were forced to lay off the majority of our staff, including editorial members that we adore and who would’ve happily helped us cover the protests over the past few days. Currently we have the staff that we can afford, and to be honest, after working nearly 30 hours over the past weekend alone, we’re tired. Tired, but undaunted, because that’s our job: We want you to see what we see. You can help keep our eyes and hearts on the street, and hopefully allow us to get more help in the future, by making monthly donations to the Mercury if you are able. We certainly appreciate all the help you’ve given us thus far, and trust me when I say not a penny has gone to waste. Please take care of yourselves—especially now—and if you can, join those who practice de-escalation and the protection of those who need it most. We’ll be looking out for you, too. Yer always pal, Wm. Steven Humphrey Editor-in-Chief Portland Mercury",0.0

The large crowds of protestors and sizeable police response left swaths of downtown Portland inaccessible to transit trains and buses. In the midst of unpredictable protest patterns and a heavy police response, TriMet riders have been left with little warning regarding when service will be delayed or suspended, and which areas are safe to travel through. All five MAX lines and many TriMet bus routes run through downtown Portland, meaning service has been impacted throughout the region. “The past several days and nights, we have had to adjust service for the safety of our riders, operators, and equipment,” TriMet spokesperson Roberta Altstadt wrote in an email to the Mercury. “Altering train and bus service also is for the safety of the demonstrators and law enforcement who may find themselves in the streets we travel… Adjusting service has been done quickly, with little warning. That is for the safety of everyone, and following the guidance of police.” On Friday night—the first night of peaceful protests that turned into looting, property damage, and a forceful police response as the night went on—TriMet vehicles traveling through the downtown core experienced severe delays. Though Mayor Ted Wheeler declared an 8 pm curfew on Saturday night, TriMet provided service for essential workers exempt from the curfew. But as the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) used pepper balls and flashbang stun grenades to disperse crowds downtown, TriMet suspended downtown service starting at 7:30 pm. On Sunday afternoon and night, crowds of thousands marched on East Burnside and protested in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center downtown, despite an extension of Wheeler’s curfew. TriMet ceased its downtown service at 3:30 pm Sunday on PPB’s advice. The transit agency plans to stop downtown service again at 8 pm on Monday evening, as Wheeler’s curfew is extended another night and more protests are expected. “TriMet asks riders to keep a close eye on news reports and any developing demonstrations that could impact service,” reads a Monday afternoon media release from TriMet. Riders can also check TriMet’s Twitter and website, and sign up for email alerts. In addition to disrupting service, the protests have taken their toll on TriMet buses, trains, and other infrastructure. “Unfortunately, we’ve sustained quite a bit of vandalism to bus stops and MAX stations in Downtown Portland and the Lloyd neighborhood,” Altstadt wrote to the Mercury. “Along with graffiti, we’ve had shelters, benches, and information displays destroyed, that are meant to help our riders when using the transit system. Some trains and buses have been vandalized as well and we’ve had to remove them from service, causing further delays for riders.” “While we understand emotions are high, we would ask that people don’t vandalize our vehicles, stops, and stations,” she added. “It impacts our efforts to provide transit service to those who rely on it.”",0.0

A scene from a Friday night vigil for George Floyd at Portland's Peninsula Park. Alex Zielinski Good morning Portland. It's been a long weekend for our small team over here at the Merc. I apologize in advance for any sleepy-eyed blunders in this morning's news roundup. It's been just under a week since Minneapolis police officers left George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, dying on the streets of his city. In the days since, every major city (and a bunch of minor ones) has shown their outrage over another Black man's death with massive protests, some leading to property destruction, looting, and arson. In many instances, armed police officers in riot gear have responded with violence, in the form of tear gas, explosive munitions, and seemingly unprovoked aggression.

That includes Eugene Weekly reporter Henry Houston. My favorite part was watching the police officers inside their tank laugh as I screamed I’m a journalist. — Henry Houston (@hwhouston1) June 1, 2020 Portland saw three nights of varied protests, including a peaceful vigil in North Portland, a frenzy of broken windows, theft, burning banks, and tear gas downtown, and a large march of chanting demonstrators winding through Portland's Eastside. Here's the Mercury's live, on-the-ground coverage from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has offered somewhat contradicting responses to the weekend's events, both condemning and acknowledging the intention behind destructive rallies. Yesterday afternoon, a group of Black Portland leaders joined him at a press conference to demand he continue to improve the inequitable and racist outcomes of his governing. Wheeler placed the City of Portland under a 8 pm curfew in the past few nights. That curfew will be reactivated tonight. In a morning press conference, US Attorney Billy Williams called for Gv. Brown to activate the National Guard. ""Everyone is doing their best, but we need bodies,"" said Williams. ""We need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence."" As an example, Williams points to protesters dispersing and spreading out over the city ""at some point during each protest."" (Does not mention that police officers are using tactics—tear gas, munitions—that force these crowds to disperse). — Alex Zielinski (@alex_zee) June 1, 2020 Meanwhile, a Gresham police officer shot and killed a man in Southeast Portland yesterday evening. The exact details of the shooting have yet to come out — but we're paying attention. During the eruptive weekend, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown fired the head of the Oregon Employment Department for the agency's shockingly slow ability to deliver unemployment benefits—even months after jobless Oregonians have filed claims.

It also marks the second night of curfews instituted by Mayor Ted Wheeler for the entirety of Portland. The first night of protests were marked by fires set in the Multnomah County Justice Center and damage to high-end stores downtown. Last night, Saturday May 30, a game of cat-and-mouse was played between protesters who violated the city-wide curfew and cops, who separated the largest group and chased them to the east side of the river. The rest of the evening police focused on those who Mayor Wheeler called ""agitators""—though they were mostly unsuccessful in causing any substantive damage. Tonight starts with two protest/vigils: The first is a ""Demand Justice March"" to honor Black Portlanders killed by police at North Portland's Frazer Park at 7 pm, and the other a ""rally against police brutality"" led by the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front at Laurelhurst Park starting at 6 pm.

Norway's U.N. Ambassador Mona Juul, head of the 54-nation U.N. body, told a meeting Tuesday on financing for the coronavirus crisis and recovery that the decision by the world's 20 major economic powers to freeze debt service payments for the world's poorest countries through the end of the year isn't enough. She said the Group of 20's suspension will free about $11 billion until the end of the year, but it's estimated that eligible countries have an additional $20 billion in multilateral and commercial debt combined coming due this year. Juul said that means even if the moratorium is extended to 2021, 'many countries will have to make difficult choices between servicing their debt, fighting the pandemic, and investing in recovery.' ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: "" Protest of police use-of-force held in Paris despite virus ban "" Mayor says Chicago will proceed with easing lockdown despite vandalism, protests "" Kenya prosecutor orders arrest of officer in death of boy shot during curfew "" While the World Health Organization publicly praised China in January for its speedy response to the then-new coronavirus, the U.N. health agency was frustrated behind the scenes by China's delays in sharing information needed to fight the spread of the virus, The Associated Press has found.

All but one of the new cases were reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where hundreds of infections have been linked to entertainment venues, church gatherings and a massive e-commerce warehouse. Mayors and governors in the greater capital area have shut thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars, karaoke rooms, churches and wedding halls to slow the spread of the virus. But despite the spike in transmissions, the government has been pushing ahead with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high-school seniors on May 20.

Whelan Prine spoke over a video livestream and did not attend in person. In her words: 'This is not or should not be a partisan issue. This is a serious health issue. And you, as our representatives, must advocate for our health, our safety and our right to participate in our Americana political process.' Her 73-year-old husband was revered for his wise and witty lyrics in dozens of quirky, original songs such as 'Angel from Montgomery,' 'Sam Stone' and 'Hello in There.'hey are unconstitutional. The High Court of Gauteng Province on Tuesday gave the government 14 days to amend and republish the regulations in a way so they do not infringe on people's rights. South Africa's lockdown began on March 27 and has been gradually relaxed, but it still bans the sale of cigarettes and prevents most businesses and factories from operating at full capacity. The regulations also prohibit large public gatherings and restrict funerals to no more than 50 people. In a statement on Tuesday, the government noted the court's decision and said it would respond once it has studied the ruling. South Africa currently has the highest number of confirmed virus cases in Africa with more than 34,000, including 705 deaths. ___ PARIS "" Thousands of people are defying a virus-linked police ban in Paris and have converged on the French capital's main courthouse for a demonstration to show solidarity with U.S. protesters and to denounce the death of a black man in French police custody. The demonstration in Paris and similar protests in other French cities on Tuesday were organized to honor Frenchman Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016 and to support Americans demonstrating against the death of George Floyd' in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Paris police banned the gathering a few hours before it was supposed to start, citing virus restrictions forbidding gatherings of more than 10 people. The circumstances of Traore's death are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved says it didn't result from the conditions of his arrest but factors such as a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' ___ NAIROBI, Kenya "" Kenya's director of public prosecution has ordered the arrest and prosecution of a police officer in the death of 13-year-old Yasin Hussein Moyo. The boy was shot dead while standing on his family's balcony in March as police moved through his crowded neighborhood enforcing a coronavirus curfew. Police at first said he was hit by a stray bullet. The death caused an outcry. Also Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, established by Parliament, said 15 deaths and 31 incidents in which people sustained injuries have been directly linked to actions of police officers during curfew enforcement. ___ CHICAGO "" Mayor Lori Lightfoot says Chicago will proceed with its next stage of reopening after coronavirus stay-at-home orders despite days of unrest and violence. Vandalism and violent clashes have followed peaceful protests citywide after George Floyd's death. Numerous businesses have been destroyed. City crews helped secure about 175 buildings, many in neighborhood commercial corridors. Still, Lightfoot says the overwhelming response from business owners has been that reopening should continue Wednesday as planned. That's when restaurants, salons and other businesses can open with restrictions. Chicago has been under strict restrictions since March. Its reopening plan is tied declining COVID-19 infections. ___ BAGHDAD -- Iraq's Health Ministry is reporting a record-breaking single-day spike in confirmed coronavirus cases that it says resulted from increased testing. At least 519 new cases were confirmed Tuesday, bringing the country's total to 7,387, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. Iraq has reported a total of 235 virus-related deaths. The number of confirmed cases in Iraq tripled in the last two weeks as more people were tested. Thousands more are being tested on a daily basis, according to daily government reports. The Health Ministry said at least 3,000 were tested nationwide in the previous 24 hours. Since he was sworn in last month, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has reinforced full-day curfews, prohibited non-essential businesses from operating and banned large crowds from gathering. Iraq faces shortages of hospital beds and ventilators. Health professionals have warned that a flareup in cases could be catastrophic for the country's health system. ___ ROME "" Italy's Lombardy region has continued to register by far the highest day-to-day increase in coronavirus cases after emerging as the epicenter of the nation's outbreak in February. The Health Ministry reported Tuesday evening that Lombardy accounted for 187 of Italy's 318 new confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours. Total confirmed cases now number 233,515, although authorities say many people with mild symptoms may have had the virus but never underwent testing. Italy also reported 55 more virus-related deaths in the same 24-hour period, raising the national death toll from the pandemic to 33,530. Since many elderly people who died during the outbreak in nursing homes or in their own homes weren't tested, authorities acknowledge that the actual death toll is likely much higher. A government-ordered ban on travel between regions is set to end on Wednesday. Italy also will start allowing in tourists from most of Europe. ___ KARACHI, Pakistan -- Two Pakistani lawmakers have died after testing positive for the coronavirus amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Officials said Tuesday that Munir Khan Orakzai, a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament, died in northwest Pakistan. They said a minister in the southern Sindh province, Ghulam Murtaza Baloch, died at a hospital in the port city of Karachi. Their deaths came weeks after the first virus-related death of a lawmaker in Pakistan took place in the eastern city of Lahore. Pakistan on Tuesday reported 78 deaths in the past 24 hours from the country's outbreak. Critics blame Prime Minister Imran Khan for an increase in deaths and infections. THey accuse him of easing restrictions last month at a time when there was a need to enforce a stricter lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Pakistan has recorded a total of 76,398 confirmed cases and 1,621 deaths since February. ___ MADRID -- Spain's Health Ministry says it recorded no deaths from COVID-19 for a second day in a row. The latest official data reported Tuesday showed an increase in new confirmed cases, however -- 137 in the previous 24 hours compared with an increase of 71 cases between Sunday and Monday. Madrid accounted for over half of the new cases, with 73. The Spanish capital has been the area of the country hardest-hit by the coronavirus. The head of Spain's emergency response called the falling death rate 'very encouraging.' Fernando Sim�n added that the number of patients being treated in intensive care units has also been declining, with only nine people admitted to ICUs over the past seven days. Spain's official national death toll from the pandemic is 27,127, while the country has almost 240,000 confirmed cases. ___ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates "" Dubai has announced that shopping malls and the private sector can operate at full capacity starting Wednesday following weeks of restrictions and curfews. Still, people must adhere to social distancing and wear face masks in public. Some of Dubai's largest malls have already installed thermal scanners at gates to check the temperatures of all entering. In recent days, Dubai "" known for its sprawling malls, shopping and luxury hotels "" has also opened some public beaches, parks and gyms. Mosques, public pools, amusement parks, nurseries and schools remain closed. The capital of the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, began restricting movement in and out of the city for a week starting Tuesday. Abu Dhabi said the move is aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 there. ___ ATHENS, Greece "" Greek authorities have temporarily suspended flights from Qatar until June 15, after 12 people on a flight from Doha tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities have quarantined all 91 passengers from the flight that landed Monday. International flights to Greece are currently only allowed into Athens, with all passengers subject to compulsory coronavirus tests. The Civil Protection Agency said Tuesday nine of the passengers who tested positive were Pakistani nationals with residence permits in Greece, two were Greek citizens coming from Australia and one was a Japanese national from a Greek-Japanese family. Greece currently has a very low coronavirus rate, with 179 deaths and just over 2,900 confirmed positive cases. Health authorities announced zero deaths on Tuesday, and 19 new confirmed positive cases, including the 12 from the Doha flight. ___ ROME "" Hundreds of demonstrators have gathered in Rome shunning masks to protest against the Italian government's measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Members of a marginal political movement created last year by a retired Carabinieri general have emerged as a virus-denial camp in Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the global pandemic. The leader of the so-called Orange Vests told the protest crowd assembled in the Piazza del Popolo on Tuesday that children shouldn't be made to wear masks and he threatened to ''slap'' anyone who did. Antonio Pappalardo added that he refuses to wear a mask himself and said: ''These lungs mine. I will take care of my lungs. Breathing is sacred.'' The people packing the square didn't adhere to social-distancing guidelines set by the government. Other speakers at the protest asserted that the pandemic ''never existed'' and alleged that politicians had played it up to enhance their own powers. ___ TOKYO "" The governor of Tokyo has issued a coronavirus alert for the Japanese capital amid worries of a resurgence of infections only a week after a state of emergency ended. Governor Yuriko Koike issued a 'Tokyo alert' on Tuesday after 34 new cases were confirmed in the city, where confirmed infections had slowed to a few per day in late May. Koike said: 'The alert is to precisely inform the people of the status of infections and to advise caution.' Lighting on Tokyo's Rainbow Bridge will be changed from rainbow-colored to red as a sign of alert. However, the alert does not mean restrictions that just got eased will be reimposed immediately. Under the second phase of a three-part plan for resuming business activity, Tokyo's theaters, fitness gyms and other commercial facilities reopened. Night clubs, karaoke parlors and other highest-risk establishments are still closed. shut observing shutdown requests. ___ MOSCOW "" Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to take quick steps to repair economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported to Putin on Tuesday that the Cabinet's plan contains measures designed to stimulate economic growth, raise incomes and reduce unemployment. It envisages spending 5 trillion rubles (about $73 billion) until December 2021. A partial economic shutdown that Putin ordered in late March to stem the country's outbreak badly hurt an economy already battered by a sharp drop in oil prices. The Russian leader says the nation is now past the peak of contagion, allowing regional officials to gradually ease the restrictions. However, some experts warned that a daily increase of about 9,000 confirmed cases makes a quick lifting of the lockdown dangerous. ____ LONDON "" A leading epidemiologist said the coronavirus outbreak in the U.K. is unlikely to worsen during the summer but that the outlook from September was 'very unclear.' Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said he expects levels of coronavirus transmissions and cases to 'remain relatively flat between now and September, short of very big policy changes or behavior changes in the community.' He told a committee of lawmakers in the House of Lords on Tuesday that the 'real uncertainty' will be in September. Ferguson resigned from his position as a government adviser last month after revelations that he broke social-distancing rules. A coronavirus lockdown is being eased across the U.K., most quickly in England, raising concerns among many health officials of a potential second spike in infections. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.""",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore — Portland’s current system of police oversight is called the Independent Police Review and it's part of the city auditor’s office. It started in 2001. “In the bizarre structure of city government that we have in Portland. A lot of the accountability stuff goes under the auditor’s office. So, we report to the city auditor, who is an elected official. We don’t report to the mayor, who the police bureau reports to, so we are sectioned off in that way,” said Director Ross Caldwell. If you have a complaint or a compliment for a Portland police officer, you file it at their website. When big protests break out in Portland, there is often interaction with police, and then complaints from some about how they were treated. The phone calls are already pouring into the IPR office. “Portland has about 300 protest events a year and a lot of those are very small. These are obviously on the very big end of the spectrum. But that does bring a lot of public interest, a lot of interaction between law enforcement and the public, so that's something we're constantly hearing about,” Caldwell said. The IPR reviews hundreds of complaints a year from citizens and more from other police officers. From 2014-2019, the IPR found misconduct in a total of 200 different cases. Candace Avalos is the chair of the volunteer group of citizens who review complaints. “I think the community definitely values the work we do and we have certain community members that tend to engage with our work a lot, and we had a retreat a couple years ago and they specifically mentioned this work is important even though it’s difficult, and we don't always get done what we want to get done. But people appreciate knowing that we are there,” she said. Here's a deeper look into what happened in 2019 with regards to complaints about police in Portland: The IPR fielded a total of 408 complaints. 155 were quickly closed because they obviously had no merit. The IPR staff investigated 92 of the cases. Another 76 got a precinct referral, meaning it did not involve misconduct but the precinct commander is notified and can follow up with the person who complained. Seventy-five got supervisory investigation, which means the officer is not disciplined but the precinct commander is notified they need more coaching and the community member wants to talk to the boss. On top of that, other officers filed complaints against their fellow cops 69 times. And 50 were investigated. Of the most serious cases in 2019, 32 were sent to the chief for discipline. Of those, 13 got command counseling, nine received a letter of reprimand, six got one- or two-day suspensions without pay, three were suspended more than a week without pay and five resigned or retired before the final disciplinary ruling.",0.0

Though the first three nights of protest at the State Capitol turned into riots in downtown Salem, Tuesday's gathering remained peaceful. Protesters in Salem were part of a nationwide response to the death of George Floyd, who died after being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Tuesday's event in Salem, led by organizer Jonathan Jones, included participants who sang songs, waved signs, chanted and even danced throughout the evening until crowds disbursed at the 11 p.m. curfew. “I want (tonight) to be the interlude between the anger,” Jones said. City of Salem officials extended the curfew for six more nights, from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. June 2 to June 8, to help the Salem Police Department maintain public safety and prevent further destruction and violence. Lt. Treven Upkes said he hopes officers’ presence and availability will allow for meaningful dialogue. “Unfortunately, a lot of the conversations we are clouded by the national feeling,” Upkes said Tuesday. “A lot of these people haven’t had interactions with us so they’re just getting learn about us — and we’re willing to talk to them.""

Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect. An officer, using an expletive, orders them to go home. Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered 'essential workers"" and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds 'I don't give a s""-.' Another tells Bumsted 'get the f""- out of here you piece of s""-."" Bumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted's car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left. Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media. 'They didn't care,' Wong said. 'They were just shoving me.' NYPD officials said they would 'review this as soon as possible.' Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the U.S. over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck. Police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet. Journalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter's microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer's camera was smashed. In Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters. AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers' actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew. 'The role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,"" Easton said. ""It is unacceptable and deeply troubling when journalists are harassed simply for doing their job.'",0.0

It is exceedingly dangerous to assume that oppression and pain can be inflicted without consequence, to believe that the victim will silently absorb the injury and the wound will fade. No, the injuries compound, particularly when there is no effort to alter the system doing the wounding, no avenue by which the aggrieved can seek justice. This all breeds despair, simmering below the surface, a building up in need of release, to be let out, to lash out, to explode. As protests and rioting have swept across the country in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis, it’s evident that America has failed to learn that lesson yet again. The protests are not necessarily about Floyd’s killing in particular, but about the savagery and carnage that his death represents: The nearly unchecked ability of the state to act with impunity in the oppression of black bodies and the taking of black life. It is an anger over feeling powerless, stalked and hunted, degraded and dehumanized. It is an anger that the scenes keep repeating themselves until one feels exhausted and wrung out. It is an anger over feeling that people in power on every level — individual officers as well as local, state and federal government — are utterly unresponsive to people’s calls for fundamental change and equal justice under the law and equal treatment by it. When people feel helpless, like there is nothing left to lose, like their lives already hang in the balance, a wild, swirling, undirected rage is a logical result. You destroy people’s prospects, they’ll destroy your property. Our intransigence on the issue of social justice and use of force by the police is making last-straw extremists of members of a generation that feels unheard and disrespected. We can bemoan the violence that has attended some of these protests, but we must also recognize that to have to live in a world, in a society, in which you feel that your very life is constantly under threat because of the color of your skin is also a form of violence. It is a daily, ambient, gnawing violence. It is the kind that makes a grown man’s shoulder draw up and his jaws clench whenever officers approach, even when there has been no offense or infraction. It is the kind that forces mothers down to pray whenever a child is out late, pleading to the gods for his or her safe return. It is the kind that makes a child think to write a parent’s phone number on their skin when they sense trouble brewing, just in case. This is also violence. Indeed, America is not only the progenitor of this type of violence, but it sadly responds most to violence. That’s when people pay attention, that’s when the ears perk up, that’s when the news crews come. During the Civil Rights Movement, the protesters practiced nonviolence, but they were regularly met with violence, and it was that violence that spurred action. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed after the violence against protesters was broadcast on TV, four little girls were killed in the bombing of Birmingham, Alabama’s 16th Street Baptist Church and the killing of Medgar Evers in 1963. The Civil Rights Act of 1968, popularly known as the Fair Housing Act, was passed after Martin Luther King was assassinated and rioting swept the country. If America wants peace it must be responsive in peacetime. You can’t demonize an athlete who peacefully takes a knee to protest against police brutality, labeling him a “son of a bitch,” as President Donald Trump did, and then pine for peaceful protests now. It seems that no form of protest has been effective in this fight for justice. It seems that what the public and the power structure want is a continuation of the status quo. They want stillness and passivity. They want obedience. They want your suffering to be silent, your trauma to be tranquil. That won’t happen. Some of the people now breaking things and burning things and looting things are ironically participating in a storied American tradition. There has long been a penchant for destruction in this country, an insatiable bloodlust, that the country conveniently likes to forget. American violence is learned violence. It is the American way. White people in America have rioted, slaughtered, massacred and destroyed for centuries, often directing their anger and violence at black people and Native Americans, to take what they had or destroy it, to unleash their rage and assert their superiority, to instill terror, to maintain power. Sunday marks the 99th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre in which a whole prosperous black neighborhood known as “Black Wall Street” was destroyed and as many as 300 people killed because of a violent white mob. White riots have often, historically, targeted black people, while black people have rioted to protest injustice. On either side, racism is the root. And we have refused to sufficiently address it. Now, that chicken is coming home to roost. Charles M. Blow writes for the New York Times.",0.0

Experts fear protests in some of the nation's hot spots could spread the coronavirus. Oklahoma State linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga says he tested positive for COVID-19 after he attended a protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ogbongbemiga made the announcement in a Twitter post. The 21-year-old Ogbongbemiga says he was ""well protective"" of himself during the protest. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe,” he wrote. Ogbongbemiga was a second team All-Big 12 selection last season. He finished with 100 tackles and five sacks.

Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___",0.0

I chose to stay on the periphery, as being in the thick of things felt uncomfortable for this 68 year old. I was on the west side of Ferry Street, across from the courthouse. There were two moments that stood out to me. The first was when a Eugene police officer, standing beside his vehicle on High Street, thanked me for coming. He didn’t have to do that. The second, and most powerful, was standing on the northeast corner of the Ferry Street bridge and observing wave after wave of community members coming over the crest of that bridge. It was impossible to witness that display of solidarity without choking up. Thank you to the organizers and to the concerned, engaged citizens of Eugene who showed up and for the EPD employees. It felt like everyone was working together to make an important statement in a safe and effective way. I am proud to be part of this community. Joan Rawlings-Boyd, Eugene",0.0
1623995303,2020-06-04 02:04:08,Editorial: Protests won't stop until police brutality does,https://www.registerguard.com/opinion/20200603/editorial-protests-wont-stop-until-police-brutality-does?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"“Stop Killing Us.” Three words, scrawled on a sign held by a 5-year-old black boy at a Tampa, Florida, protest against police brutality. Messages don’t get any clearer than that. Yet to judge by the days of protests sweeping the country, this message still hasn’t gotten through. Last week it was George Floyd, who died while restrained by a police officer in the middle of a Minneapolis street in daylight, though he posed no physical threat. His alleged offense? Passing a counterfeit bill to buy a pack of cigarettes. Before him it was Breonna Taylor, an emergency room technician in Louisville, Kentucky, shot dead in her own apartment by officers who used a battering ram to burst through her front door. Before Taylor it was Laquan McDonald. And Eric Garner. And Michael Brown. And Sandra Bland. And Tamir Rice. And Walter Scott. And Alton Sterling. And Philando Castile. And Botham Jean. And Amadou Diallo. The list goes on and on, and on and on. Black Americans brutalized or killed by law enforcement officers, who rarely if ever face consequences for their actions. Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of kneeling on Floyd’s neck until he was dead, had 18 prior complaints filed against him. In the name of all these men and women and countless more, this is why thousands of Americans have taken to the streets — to express a rage born of despair. Despair that their government has failed to provide one of the most fundamental protections in the Constitution: the right to life, and to not be deprived of that life without due process of law. Stop killing us. What the protesters want is a country where bad cops are fired rather than coddled. They want a country where cops who beat demonstrators aren’t protected by their unions, but instead lose their jobs. A vast majority of these protests have been peaceful. But not all. Where they are not, police officers are often the target of that violence. Officers may feel left with no good options in that moment, but how they respond does matter. Riots are “socially destructive and self-defeating,” the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1967, during an earlier spasm of unrest. In the same passage he wrote, “It is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots.” “In the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard,” King said. “As long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.” More than half a century later, justice is still being postponed. Racial inequality remains rampant in wealth, housing, employment, education — and enforcement of the law. This is not news, but it is the responsibility of all those in power to recognize and fix it. As President Lyndon Johnson’s Kerner Commission found after studying the inequality at the root of the 1960s riots: “White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it and white society condones it.” Here are some steps to move the country toward a place where citizens don’t live in fear of those charged with serving and protecting them: USE-OF-FORCE POLICIES In departments with policies that sharply limit when, where and how police officers may use force, shootings and killings by the police are much lower. For instance, police officers should be required to try de-escalation before resorting to the use of force. They should not be allowed to choke people. Officers should be required to stop other officers from using excessive force. TRANSPARENCY When the police do use deadly force, the public should be able to know about it. That means getting rid of provisions like Section 50-a of New York’s civil rights law, which prevents the release of police personnel and disciplinary records and allows bad officers to continue abusing their power with impunity. ACCOUNTABILITY Police officers enjoy a web of protections against the consequences of their behavior on the job. From the legal doctrine of qualified immunity to state and local police indemnification laws, it is nearly impossible for a plaintiff to get any justice, even when an officer unquestionably violated his or her rights. UNION CONTRACTS Across the country, powerful police unions negotiate favorable contracts that shield the police from investigation and discourage citizens from bringing complaints. The contracts make it easier to hire, and harder to fire, officers with documented histories of bad behavior. Cities are under no obligation to agree to these terms, and they shouldn’t. LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING Following the beating of Rodney King and the Los Angeles riots in 1992, Congress empowered the Justice Department to oversee local police departments. That led to scores of investigations and long-overdue reforms in places like Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. But the federal government also has other tools. It can deny grants to police departments that fail to impose strict use-of-force policies or refuse to discipline officers who engage in misconduct. DEMILITARIZATION When you have a grenade launcher, even peaceful protesters look like enemy combatants. It’s no surprise that as police departments have stocked up on military-grade equipment, they have acted more aggressively. The Obama administration restricted the flow of certain types of equipment, but President Donald Trump lifted those restrictions in 2017. Most of the above reforms can happen right now, as departments around the country have shown. And when they do, the police and citizens begin to see one another as collaborators rather than antagonists. In Camden, New Jersey, where the police recently adopted some innovative reforms, officers marched alongside protesters. In Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday when it was revealed that the police who shot and killed a man overnight were not recording with body cameras, the police chief was fired. But in too many police departments there is a culture of impunity. Until that culture is changed, there will continue to be rightful rage at its existence. Rather than just condemning or applauding protesters, Americans should listen closely to what they’re demanding.",0.0
1623995300,2020-06-04 02:04:08,Senior: What Trump and toxic cops have in common,https://www.registerguard.com/opinion/20200603/senior-what-trump-and-toxic-cops-have-in-common?rssfeed=true,en,False,,662754,Register Guard,http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/rg/news/index.csp,"In his first Inaugural Address, and hopefully his last, Donald Trump talked about American carnage. He got it last week. What we couldn’t have known in January 2017 is that he wasn’t here to save us from this carnage, but to perpetuate it; that incitement wasn’t just a feature of his campaign, but of his governance. When historians look back at the Trump era, they may very well say his presidency was encapsulated by this moment, when a sadistic cop knelt on the neck of an African American man in plain view for almost 9 minutes and the streets exploded in rage. Derek Chauvin was by no means the first cop to gratuitously brutalize and lynch an African American. But he embodied something essential about Trumpism: It’s us versus them. That’s the poison ethos at the heart of police brutality, and it’s the septic core of our 45th president’s philosophy. Neither a toxic cop nor Donald Trump sees himself as a servant of all the people they’ve sworn to protect. They are solely servants of their own. Everyone else is the enemy. From the beginning, the police have received a lot of perverse messages from Trump, encouraging them to embrace the bitter angels of their nature. Three summers ago, he gave a speech on Long Island, disparaging officers who cradled the heads of suspects as they tucked them into their squad cars: “You can take the hand away, OK?” (A bank of cops, seated behind him, started to laugh and cheer.) One of Trump’s most revealing tweets since the rioting began was a boast about the prowess of the Secret Service — and to threaten to sic “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons” on the crowds outside the White House if things intensified. He’s Bull Connor with a comb-over. Or Walter E. Headley, Miami’s former police chief, who in 1967 said, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase that reappeared in a Trump tweet Friday. And this is the point, is it not? Trump, who made his political bones by peddling apocrypha about our first African American president’s country of origin, thrives on racial divisions. Us-them. Conflict zones are his comfort zone, perfect for firing up his base. But the pressures of this historic moment proved to be too much. We can’t see the African Americans who are dying in disproportionate numbers inside our hospitals, but we can see George Floyd, an African American, cruelly singled out for asphyxiation in the street. His death in police custody is a potent symbol of the obscene inequality and racial hostility of this moment, with the police officer as Trump’s smirking and pitiless proxy. African Americans — and many whites, too — were so enraged that they poured out into the streets to protest, even in the midst of a pandemic, even though African Americans are most at risk in this pandemic. A month from now, it’s quite likely many will end up in hospitals, once again in disproportionate numbers. It’s too awful to contemplate. And once again, there’s a leadership vacuum in response to the chaos, just as there is with COVID-19. It’s every state for itself, with Trump trolling the most liberal leaders for their supposed failures to contain the unrest. How these protests devolved into violence across the country will be the subject of analysis for years to come. For now, what has riveted me is that somehow, in spite of the dystopian horror unfolding in front of us, in spite of execrable responses from some of the largest police forces in the country (including New York City’s), we’re nonetheless hearing talk of America as a perfectible place — of the arc still bending. It’s been more than three years since we’ve heard that tune. Yet there was Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, issuing a wee-hours statement that asked Americans not to ignore their pain, but to use it “to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity.” There was Killer Mike, the rapper from Atlanta, reminding his fellow citizens, “Atlanta’s not perfect, but we’re a lot better than we ever were, and a lot better than cities are.” Conservatives will focus on the pleas for law and order in their messages. But what I hear is a repudiation of Trumpian nihilism — a rejection of the tyranny of the perpetual “anxious present” that Masha Gessen describes in her forthcoming book “Surviving Autocracy.” They’re instead speaking with what Gessen calls “moral ambition,” inviting fellow citizens to build a more expansive country, rather than an us-versus-them one. Their messages weren’t, “Don’t destroy your community,” so much as, “There’s a still community left for you to join. Come and make it better.” And so, along with terrifying imagery of fire and fury, we also saw images over the weekend of police officers and protesters marching together. The bonds were sometimes fragile, only to later disappear. But they happened. In Flint, Michigan. In Camden, New Jersey. In Coral Gables, Florida. In Santa Clara, California. In Ferguson, Missouri. In Kansas City, Missouri, where two cops, one white, held aloft a sign saying “End Police Brutality.” Or listen to the chief of police in Atlanta, Erika Shields, tell an anxious protester, “I hear you.” When Trump met with those who’d lost loved ones in the Parkland shooting, he needed an empathy cheat sheet that contained those very words; it was item No. 5. For her, they simply spilled out, as naturally as rain. Jennifer Senior writes for the New York Times.",0.0

Georgia Langer ’23 has been participating in Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis with her brother Quincy Powe, as well as distributing supplies to fund protesting efforts. Roland Berg ’22 has also been distributing supplies in the Twin Cities area and collecting donations to buy the supplies with some friends. Floyd was arrested because Cup Foods, a grocery store, claimed he used a counterfeit $20 bill while trying to buy cigarettes. Shortly after police arrived, Derek Chauvin, a white officer, kneeled on Floyd’s throat for nearly nine minutes, killing him as Floyd said “I can’t breathe.” Those were the exact words spoken by Eric Garner, a black man killed by a New York City police officer in 2014. The following day protests started in Minneapolis as thousands began demonstrating against police brutality toward black Americans. Floyd’s death came at a time of heightened tensions in the country after Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and Nina Pop were also killed by police or white citizens. These incidents, coupled with Floyd’s killing, have inspired protests in over 140 cities across the country. Robin Holmes-Sullivan, vice president of Student Life and dean of students, is disheartened by recent events. “I am appalled, saddened and angry about the continued disregard and targeting of black and brown individuals,” Holmes-Sullivan said via email. “This not only impacts me personally, but it impacts the lives of so many—including our students and anyone else from marginalized or disenfranchised communities here in the Portland area.” These events also motivated a statement from the LC Executive Council urging collective response against racism in what they called “a message of solidarity.” The statement was sent out to students via email on June 1. Prior to the statement’s release, in a widely shared post on social media, students and alumni demanded a public show of support for black members of the LC community by President Wim Wiewel and the college at large. “We are compelled to offer a statement to our community that recognizes this moment and calls on us to work together in support of a collective response,” the Executive Council said via email. Langer first attended protests on May 26, the day after Floyd was killed. According to her, protests were nonviolent until police put on masks, preparing to tear gas the crowd. “Everyone was social distancing until tear gas came, and with tear gas, we could not breathe with the mask on because it was just going all around inside the mask,” Langer said. “So we all took off the masks and started coughing and wheezing.” Langer, who is white, was worried for her brother, Powe, who has asthma, making him more sensitive to tear gas. Powe has a history of protesting that started when he was in ninth grade once he was informed on issues that affect him as a black man. The nature of current protests in Minneapolis is new to him. Powe views the intensity of Minneapolis protests as necessary. “What is happening now is the most intense protests I’ve ever been to in my life. (Peaceful protest) has not worked and nothing has changed,” he said. “We had black legislators, we have had a black president, we are in every system, we are engaged and nothing is changing, so I think people are tired and it has intensified.” Though he is in full support of the protests, Powe still has fear when he attends. He said this fear does not come from his fellow protesters, but rather police presence at protests and in his life. “I am terrified when I am on the frontlines, when I see things happen. I do shake, but I don’t move and I am not defeated, because I know I have to be there,” Powe said. “It is not about the fear (of protesting), because I could be dead, so I am more worried about that than afraid of being out there.” Qwynci Bowman ’23, a black woman, feels that these protests are different. She said she has hope that she has not had in the past. Looking on at protesters in Minneapolis from her hometown of Kyle, Texas, she is inspired. “As we all know, black lives matter and police brutality is not new to our society,” Bowman said. “However something about this time feels different, maybe it’s because we’ve all been trapped in our houses because of the coronavirus, but I just see lots of people coming together and demanding action.” Beyond attending protests, Langer has also been collecting supplies and dropping them off where needed. She said people have asked to give her money, but she did not trust herself to manage the funds as a white person, so she gave out her brother’s Venmo handle to accept donations. Langer said it is very important for her to be aware of her privilege, which affects how she protests. “White people as activists—it is really important because we have this role to use our white bodies, but it’s our role is to empower the people around us, the people who are minorities,” Langer said. “That’s something that I have had the privilege to know all of my life because of my brother.” Berg, who is white, has been accepting donations along with a group of his friends. He said in the first three days they raised over $2,500. The group buys the supplies protesters say they need via social media and drop them off at locations accepting donations. Once they buy enough supplies for the day and budget enough money for the next day, the group donates the remainder to community organizations such as the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a bail fund for protesters. Berg said he feels it is his responsibility to support protesters. He is proud of the response to his fundraising efforts. “There’s been a really big response which I was not expecting at all,” Berg said. “But it felt nice to be contributing in some way and helping out the community.” Berg said he is able to do this work because he is white and because of the privilege he holds. “We’re also really privileged to have a car and be able to afford gas to be making these trips all around the Twin Cities,” Berg said. “Again, we’ve been really fortunate with people donating so we’re able to get a lot of supplies.” Langer has also been assembling resources for protesters and people who want to help, but are staying home. She said it is important to be mindful that there is still a pandemic going on, but everyone can still contribute to the movement. She made a Google Doc which she linked in her Instagram bio that details information on tear gas, digital security and arrest rights. It also includes where donations can be sent, readings on race, and people to email, call and mail letters to. Langer said her document has been viewed by over 700 people. Bowman supports the protests and organizing. “I think it’s an amazing way of showing support for the cause,” Bowman said. “I love seeing everyone organizing supplies and transporting, demanding donations and going to protests. 1344/10.” 1344/10 is the code for the Hatch Act which outlines the restrictions on government employees, such as police, in political issues. Those in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been bringing it up to suggest that police are in violation of this law due to their behaviors at protests and beyond. Holmes-Sullivan is aware of students participating in demonstrations, but encourages caution. “I know that students from LC have been attempting to do something by participating in protests, letter writing, supporting bail funds and the like,” she said. “I am hoping that whatever action our students decide upon, they do so safely—for themselves and others.” In their statement, the LC Executive Council said outreach and words of encouragement were not enough to solve the issues at hand. “Our hope is that we can collectively recognize and challenge the historical, structural and systemic forms of racism that continue to threaten the lives of people of color and imperil the communities in which they live,” the Executive Council said via email. “Our hope is that we are moved to act in concrete and significant ways against the violence done to our friends, neighbors and colleagues.” Powe is proud of his sister, but makes a point that their actions will not stop here. He believes much more radical change is necessary. “It is not just about reforming the systems, it is about breaking these systems down and replacing them,” Powe said. “People need to understand that is what it is going to take because it has taken decades—it’s taken a long time to build these, it’s not going to take just a week or just a month to destroy them. We are going to tear the systems down and we are going to replace them.”",0.0

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their Election Day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. And in Washington, Janeese Lewis George, a self-identified democratic socialist, upset incumbent Brandon Todd in the Democratic primary for a seat on the city council. Todd was an ally of Mayor Muriel Bowser, who previously held the seat. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.""",0.0

Though the first three nights of protest at the State Capitol turned into riots in downtown Salem, Tuesday's gathering remained peaceful.

Social media accounts run by the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front have become information hubs for protest plans over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. Its Twitter and Facebook accounts have frequently posted details about where and when protests are happening. The PNW Youth Liberation Front began putting out public calls out to protest beginning with the Wednesday occupation of the Multnomah County Justice Center, which would become the gathering place for protesters until police blocked access Monday. No one from the PNW Youth Liberation Front responded to multiple emails regarding this story. The group describes itself on Twitter as a “decentralized network of autonomous youth collectives dedicated to direct action towards total liberation.” The description includes a black flag emoji, which often symbolizes anarchism. But no public leaders linked to the group have stepped forward, by design. Whether or not the PNW Youth Liberation Front has set membership remains unclear. It has regularly published responses to police and officials on Twitter, as well as operating as an organizing platform telling people where and when to meet. The tactic provides anonymity and a platform to publicize actions organized by individuals or smaller groups. The PNW Youth Liberation Front Twitter account has 11,000 followers, and the Facebook page has more than 3,600 followers. Its tweets are often shared hundreds of times. A post purported to be by the PNW Youth Liberation Front is published on Radical Guide, a website meant to catalog and highlight radical leftist groups and individuals, as well as their actions and art. The stated goals on the post range from calling for an end to militarized weapons by police, to taxing the wealthy, to increased funding for a reformed school system. On Twitter, the PNW Youth Liberation Front has called for sustained use of tactics relying on confrontation and openly eschewed collaboration with police. Late Monday night, the PNW Youth Liberation tweeted a claim that law enforcement had “hired infiltrators to take over the protest, and pacify it."" “Cops don’t have to openly police movements as actively if they can trick protestors into doing the policing for them,"" the PNW Youth Liberation Front tweeted Tuesday. “The PPB openly asked protestors to do this, in the name of peaceful protest, but your protest can NEVER be peaceful if it perpetuates the violence of policing.” Social media accounts for the PNW Youth Liberation Front have existed since February 2017. Their social media presence shows involvement in protests against gun violence, police, fascist groups, extraction industries and ICE, as well as engaging in mutual aid actions like providing free meals to those in need and advocating for the homeless. Prior actions promoted by the Youth Liberation Front in Portland have not drawn nearly as many people as the protests in the last week, which have routinely drawn thousands. There are various groups under the Youth Liberation Front banner across the United States, and the broader organizing structure is similar to that of antifa, meaning there is no national leadership, but rather a loose-knit fabric of autonomous, horizontal collectives organizing under a similar ideological banner in support of shared goals. Although the PNW Youth Liberation Front is anti-fascist, they are not working in tandem with Rose City Antifa to organize protests, according to a Rose City Antifa spokesperson. Other prominent leftist groups in Portland, such as PDX Resistance and Popular Mobilization, or PopMob for short, have shared PNW Youth Liberation Front’s posts and actions on social media. However, there is no indication these groups are organizing together in any official capacity. Noelle Crombie of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report. -- K.

PORTLAND, Ore. — On Tuesday night in Portland, thousands of demonstrators marched to Pioneer Courthouse Square to protest the killing of George Floyd, the black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Similar to Monday night's protests, the demonstrations involving thousands of people remained peaceful for several hours before a smaller group was declared an ""unlawful assembly"" due to illegal activities. Police at about 10:30 p.m. demanded everybody leave downtown, and announced a safe exit across the Burnside Bridge for peaceful protesters. Police said people from the smaller, separate group threw projectiles at officers, including fireworks, bottles, bats, ball bearings and batteries, and police used tear gas and flash bang grenades to disperse protesters from that smaller group. By the end of the night, police say more than a dozen people were arrested or detained. ""I want to recognize the thousands of demonstrators who came downtown in a peaceful manner and exercised their First Amendment rights. There are many thousands of you who are not involved in the violence and destruction and I thank you. I still hear your message and I know the others who are engaging in criminal acts do not represent you,"" said Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch. It was the fifth straight night of large protests in Portland, and it started with a couple hundred demonstrators at Pioneer Courthouse Square. That was followed by a ""die-in"" on the Burnside Bridge, with protesters chanting ""I can't breathe."" Just after 6:30 p.m., another demonstration began at Southeast Portland's Revolution Hall. ""It's a beautiful evening and we are pleased all those who came out are able to express their First Amendment rights,"" police tweeted. ""We appreciate you doing so peacefully."" By 8 p.m. thousands of marchers from the east side had crossed the Burnside Bridge and made their way to Pioneer Courthouse Square, where the two demonstrations converged for a peaceful rally, police said. The rally downtown was so peaceful by 9 p.m. that KGW reporter Mike Benner said police presence had been completely unnoticeable for several hours. But just before 9:30 p.m. police announced that a separate protest, at Southwest Taylor and 4th Avenue, had become an unlawful assembly with demonstrators throwing projectiles at officers. At the time, the protest at Pioneer Courthouse Square remained peaceful. The crowd of thousands at Pioneer Courthouse Square began to peacefully march back eastbound on the Burnside Bridge at 10 p.m., according to police. Meanwhile the smaller crowd continued to throw objects at officers, who demanded they leave the area immediately.

Police announced just after 11:30 that they had already arrested several people. By 12:30 most of the crowd had left downtown Portland. Those who remained, mostly at Pioneer Courthouse Square, were warned to ""leave or be subject to arrest or use of force, including riot control agents and impact munitions."" According to a news release from Portland police, a large group of demonstrators started putting up barricades to block the intersection of Southwest 6th Avenue and Southwest Yamhill Street and began piling pallets and other items on top of each other. Police say a protester poured a bucket of what police said they believe was an accelerant on the large pile. Police announced it was a civil disturbance and told people to leave the area. Police said officers drove through the large pile of items to prevent it from being set on fire. Just after midnight, KGW's chopper was flying above downtown when they spotted a group of protesters moving around barricades at the intersection of Southwest Broadway and Morrison Street, by Pioneer Courthouse Square. Within moments, a Portland police cruiser sped through the intersection, narrowly missing a handful of protesters. This was the clip that made @LauralPorter & me gasp on live TV.

""We don't know why it occurred and it's being investigated,"" she said during a Wednesday morning press conference. Resch said every use of force by Portland police officers is documented and investigated and if the actions are outside the bounds of bureau policy, they'll be addressed. It's not completely clear whether there were two incidents of police cruisers barreling through barricades where protesters were gathering. The intersection where KGW spotted the incident is two blocks away from the area Portland police addressed in their news release. Police said the crowd split up into smaller groups. Some demonstrators set fires and police made some arrests until the groups dispersed around 2 a.m. In a video released at 2:20 a.m., Resch said police have been marking some vehicles with spray paint to identify those involved in criminal activity. Resch said some people in vehicles in the crowd have supplied weapons and other items to demonstrators. Resch said officers used marking Tuesday night to identify vehicles involved in these actions so that officers can stop those vehicles later. ""This seemed like the least intrusive way to accomplish our goal of life safety,"" Resch said. Resch also said a pickup truck drove in reverse toward a group of officers Tuesday night, but no officers were injured. 2 a.m update: Activity downtown has subsided.

PORTLAND, Ore. — As more meaningful conversations about race are happening right now, the individual experience is just as complex and varied as the people who make up our country. Donna Hammond is a local union leader and native Portlander. She shared her story and perspective with KGW along with advice for moving forward.  “Full disclosure, I'm coming to you today to speak my truth and my walk in this journey. I am one woman who stands at the intersection of race and gender and the union movement,” Hammond said. “And I just want to be clear that I am not speaking on behalf of any specific color or anything. It is my truth. And I believe that there is only one race and that's the human race.” Hammond is the public sector businesses representative for the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers 48. She was one of the first women accepted into their apprenticeship program back in 1978. “When I went to work as an electrician, when I started my apprenticeship, there were men who did not want me and didn’t want a female. I was one of the first women,” she said. “And they didn’t want any people of color. That was just the norm.” Born and raised in Portland, Hammond says her parents moved to the city from the South after her father was nearly lynched in Arkansas. “When my parents moved out here to this paradise in the West, they were seeking refuge and wanting to have a place where they could start their family. And my mother refused to go back to the south again,” Hammond said. “But when I process the tape over and over again, the west was settled by people from the south. So, they brought a lot of those ideologies out here to the West Coast."" Her parents raised her to be in the union and find a job she loved. That job was an electrician, and now a leader and voice for workers. Hammond’s path to the role was filled with racial roadblocks, but she succeeded with the support of allies along the way and her own strength, reared through her own experiences. Hammond’s perspective offers a glimpse into the pain and anger spilling out on streets in her own community and across the country following the death of another unarmed black man. “I’m struggling. It is mind-bending. I cannot process what’s going on. I’m struggling with people not understanding or just the miseducation of our country, of the world. That people don’t know the history of the world, don’t understand the history of the United States. We’ve been sold, just, some bull,” she said. George Floyd’s name joins a long list of black people who have lost their lives to racial injustice in this country. It’s a part of our nation’s history that Hammond says was easily left out of our history books. That is until cellphone footage showed the world the history black Americans have been living their entire lives. “I want to say the best thing that happened to black people and to America is the technology of video tapes, and sometimes that hasn’t even helped us,” Hammond said. Racial unrest is nothing new to our nation. Protest and riots are deeply rooted in racial conflicts throughout history. However, Hammond doesn’t necessarily see the reaction to George Floyd’s death as history repeating, rather time continuing on without real change. “I would say it's just been a continuum. You know, it's just like another dig. It's what we know. This is our normal. Now you all, or the majority, you get to see what we see every day because we have a video camera.” In 1964, a young Hammond said she was part of desegregation busing in Portland. It was an effort to reduce racial segregation in schools in the U.S., assigning and transporting students to different schools in an effort to reduce the racial segregation in education. “I think that was good and bad,” she said. “I learned how to build relationships when I was bused. I learned that because of a person’s skin that they weren't any better, smarter. I developed friendships form elementary school that I still have today, but counter to that I learned that there were people who didn't want me, didn't want to see me successful, didn't want to see me and didn't want me to be there. I heard all kinds of things as a kid, you know, 'You need to go home. Don't come out here. Don't, don't, don't!' One day, I remember specifically, because they used to rock the bus, they used to call us the N-word. ""And one day when they were attacking us at the end of the day, a raw egg came in the window and landed on me, on my chest. And it was just devastating. And for the folks that were on the bus that day – I thought that they were all going to die.” That experience helped guide her when she entered the electrician trade as an adult. “This is where I find the value of being bused. I don't think that I could have survived a four-year apprenticeship in Portland, Oregon, or anywhere, in a white male dominated profession had I not experienced the racism and the torture that I went through as a kid,"" Hammond said. Hammond says her life was threatened more than once as she continued to successes in the profession she loved. “So, there were the men that wanted to take me off the planet. And I was set up to be killed a couple of times, that I know of, but then counter that – and just like what happened at the elementary school – there were people that supported me…but on the job there were white men, my brothers, who said, 'We're going to make you the best electrician that you can be. You were admitted into the IBEW into the brotherhood and so you're our sister.’ And so, I always had allies there were always more allies than there were enemies.” Now, those allies are more important than ever. She encourages everyone to take active steps to create positive change, to educate themselves, and put themselves in someone else’s shoes. “I want them to challenge themselves to explore their implicit bias. If they are in the majority class, majority population, be silent and listen to folks when they tell their story. Don't try to one-up and say, 'Well this is what happened to me.' That's not what this is about. Learn how to be an ally,” she said.",0.0

It's been a rough week for America. Last week, video of a black Minneapolis resident named George Floyd dying as a white police officer restrained him with a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd's pleas for air, was widely distributed across social media. Since then, a whirlwind of outrage, frustration and, at times, destruction has swept through cities across the United States. But while outraged by what occurred the evening of May 25 on that Minneapolis street, protestors in Forest Grove made their frustrations heard peacefully Tuesday, June 2, on Pacific Avenue under the Big Flag at the east end of town. Black, white, Latino. Old, young. Tall, short. Gray hair, purple hair, even some green. People of all walks of life were represented beneath the Stars and Stripes, and all in an effort to move the country forward from an equally shameful not-so-distant past. Xochitl Contreras, 20, and her brother Jerry Bandito, 30, were two of the primary organizers of the event. Contreras started her protest at the Forest Grove City Library with her mother Sunday night. The next day, they were joined by about 30 more people. And on Tuesday afternoon, they rallied alongside more than 300 people, waving signs at the base of the flagpole and eliciting mostly supportive honks from passing vehicles on Highway 8. The Forest Grove resident was moved by what she saw in last week's video to try to make a difference in her community. ""I kind of felt for a long time that I needed to do something,"" Contreras said. ""I didn't feel right just sitting at home and reposting and sharing information on social media. I felt like my passion needed to be put somewhere in 'real life.'"" Bandito agreed with his sister. He pointed to the country's history of oppression as a source of his exasperation. ""I think why we're here is similar to why a lot of people are starting to gather, peacefully, for the inequalities of black lives,"" he said. ""Historically, I think there's a systemic racism that our country has not only created, but embraced. And it's one that we have lived with for too long."" Among the first to show up for Tuesday's peaceful demonstration was Pete Truax, who has served as Forest Grove's mayor since 2009. The mayor was on hand to ""show his solidarity"" in the wake of an ""injustice,"" he said. ""I'm old enough to remember 1968,"" Truax said. ""And I get a little frustrated that we have come a ways since then, but the frustration of having a long ways to go gets to me."" Also present was interim Forest Grove Police Chief Henry Reimann. Demonstrators and police have had an uneasy coexistence at protests in many cities, spilling over into exchanges of glass bottles, rubber bullets, fireworks and tear gas at times. But Reimann said he was there Tuesday in support of the protestors' right to demonstrate peacefully. ""We're here to support our local community and their right to speak out in regards to the injustice of last week's events,"" Reimann said. Of Floyd's death, which the Hennepin County medical examiner ruled a homicide earlier this week, Reimann added, ""It was a terrible, terrible unjustified thing. We don't have all the facts, but what I've seen is not condoned by anyone in our profession."" The officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck in the video, Derek Chauvin, was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department last week, and he is facing murder and manslaughter charges in connection with Floyd's death from asphyxiation. 'This gives me hope' In Forest Grove, most protesters wore masks, encouraged to reduce the risk of viral transmission as cases of COVID-19 have surged in the community. Many also carried signs and wore T-shirts and hats with slogans like ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Be the Change,"" ""Silence is Violence"" and ""We Will Not Be Silent."" They also repeatedly chanted: ""What's his name? George Floyd!"" ""I can't breathe!"" ""No justice, no peace."" ""This is what community looks like!"" Elizabeth Burnard, 22, was part of that ""community."" The Forest Grove and Oregon State University graduate held a sign that said ""This Was Preventable,"" and she cited a long history of racial violence that presaged Floyd's death. She participated in protests last weekend in downtown Portland, and after that, she was impressed by what she saw in Forest Grove. ""It's absolutely amazing to see this many people fighting for such a good cause,"" Burnard said. Most passersby were supportive, honking their horns, extending fists or peace signs, or saying ""thank you"" to the demonstrators. There were some, however, who showed their opposition, jeering the group at the flagpole — something that didn't fall lightly on Burnard. ""It's heartbreaking to see people stand up for something they really believe in, only to have people try and tear it down,"" she said. ""We're fighting for something we truly believe in, and it's hard to believe people can be so rude."" Anthony Washington has seen that rude behavior firsthand, and not just at demonstrations like Tuesday's. The Portland native, who has lived in Forest Grove for nearly a decade, said he's seen his share of racism up close and personal. Floyd's death brought many of the emotions of his close encounters to the surface, but despite his anger, Washington said much of what's occurred in its aftermath could have been avoided had the four officers who detained Floyd simply been arrested after he died. ""If the next day those guys are under arrest, none of this happens,"" Washington said. ""That's all that should've happened, and everybody would be clapping."" Instead, the situation has crystalized. The result has been turmoil, unrest and sadness, and for many people of color, the sense of a recurring nightmare playing out all over again. Can that change? The protestors certainly hope so, and Mayor Truax believes they just might hold the key. ""This gives me hope,"" Truax said. ""These people are considerably younger than I am, and they're our country and our planet's future. Their belief in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Their belief in one world, one planet. And their belief in protecting the planet, sustainability and all of it, it's now on them. We had our opportunity and we kind of blew it, so hopefully they have their North Star. ""Protests like these are not part of the problem, they're part of the solution.""",0.0
1624291945,2020-06-03 08:29:03,5th night of protests largely peaceful despite ending with arrests,https://www.koin.com/local/multnomah-county/fifth-night-portland-protests-largely-peaceful-arrests/,en,False,"politics and government, blacks, police, demonstrations and riots",1406,koin cbs,http://www.koinlocal6.com/default.aspx,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — The fifth night of protests throughout Portland ultimately ended with around a dozen arrests — out of thousands of peaceful demonstrators — throughout Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. The city’s fifth night of protests began with two large groups holding peaceful demonstrations in various parts of Portland. Thousands gathered in Pioneer Courthouse Square while another large crowd marched back and forth across the Burnside Bridge. Hundreds more gathered for a peaceful march earlier in the day in Tualatin. Peaceful day of Portland protests ends in clashes The thousands who marched across the Burnside Bridge stopped to lie face down on the ground for nine minutes of silence — the same amount of time as the officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. They eventually merged with the second large group at Pioneer Courthouse Square where speakers shared their personal experiences and called for justice, peace and change for black America. The previous night’s large protest remained peaceful, prompting Mayor Ted Wheeler’s decision to not impose a curfew Tuesday night. Photos: 5th night of Portland protests, June 2, 2020 These peaceful demonstrations lasted for hours until just after 9 p.m. when Portland police said “criminal activity” occurred at SW 4th and Taylor. Officers later praised the groups who had remained peaceful all day but said a splinter group in the hundreds tried to tear down boundary fencing protecting the area around the Justice Center. Around 12:30 a.m., police declared an unlawful assembly as some people lit fireworks and threw objects at officers — to which police began firing tear gas and flash grenades in response. Police said they made over a dozen arrests throughout the night, though the exact number is unclear. More information on those arrests is forthcoming. Officers say they continued to ask for compliance and thanked those who obeyed requests to leave the area. Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch said some people were throwing things at officers such as ball bearings, fireworks and more. They even say some vehicles were spotted in the area providing weapons to people. At one point overnight, Resch said one truck attempted to hit officers. Chief Resch says they had to develop tactics to deal with cars and trucks in these instances. “We have deployed stop sticks in some instances,” she said. “We have also used marking as a method, so we can identify these vehicles to stop later. This seemed like the least intrusive way to accomplish our goal of life safety.” She did not elaborate on how they are marking vehicles. Police say a video showing a police vehicle striking a barricade near Southwest 6th Avenue and Yamhill Street has been circulating online. Command staff are looking into the incident, according to the PPB. Despite all this — most of the night was largely peaceful as thousands gathered throughout downtown Portland in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. It is extremely important to note that throughout the last few nights in Portland, peaceful demonstrators have made clear that those participating in violence and looting are not associated with their movement. Chief Resch said she understands the majority of people were there to protest peacefully and this small group of violent demonstrators does not represent the whole. During most of the evening, people in Pioneer Courthouse Square came together and chanted the name of George Floyd — the man whose death sparked protests nationwide as they call for an end to systemic racial injustice and police brutality. “I want to recognize the thousands of demonstrators who came downtown in a peaceful manner and exercised their first amendment rights,” said Chief Jami Resch. “There are many thousands of you who are not involved in violence and destruction and I thank you. I still hear your message and know the others who are engaging in criminal acts do not represent you. Many others aggressively engaged in acts of violence directed at the police tonight. Fireworks, bottles, bats, ball bearings, batteries and other projectiles were thrown at police throughout the night. Every day is a different situation and events unfold at a rapid pace. I ask if demonstrators are planning to come downtown in the coming days to avoid bringing children, heed sound truck warnings and obey lawful orders.”",0.0

According to Eugene police, the protest began with two dozen people at East Eighth Avenue and Mill Street. The group grew in numbers as it marched through the downtown area, chanting ""black lives matter"" and ""say his name, George Floyd."" The group ended at the federal courthouse and after eight minutes of silence for Floyd a white officer’s knee was on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes, 46 seconds the floor was opened up for people of color to speak. One speaker brought up the legacy of Charles Landeros. Landeros was fatally shot January 2019 by Eugene police, which was ruled justified by the Lane County DA, after he pulled a gun on police while being escorted from his child’s school. Andiel Brown, director of Gospel Choirs and Ensembles at the University of Oregon and a former University of Oregon football player, told the Register-Guard he stopped by on his way home from work to make sure someone black spoke to hundreds of mostly white protesters. He told the crowd that the frustration with racism has been building for 400 years. ""What do you expect but a riot?"" Brown said. He cautioned the white protesters, ""but those who are a guest in our struggle don’t get to riot."" Another speaker, Tre Stewart, said he was accepting donations on his Venmo @Stoggrd to help local businesses affected by Saturday’s protest that ended in the vandalism of some properties downtown. Stewart has been livestreaming area protests. After the vigil at the courthouse broke up, groups continued to march and walked through the UO campus and made their way west on Franklin Boulevard. Eugene police put out an advisory, urging motorists to avoid ""the westbound Franklin Boulevard area near Hilyard and toward downtown. There is a large march.""

""The activities tonight appeared well organized and self-regulating,"" Eugene police Chief Chris Skinner said in an emailed news release. ""There were times the march took up roadways, but it was not hugely disruptive. Because of this, there was no need for us to intervene given the way the participants were behaving. I definitely give this group credit for maintaining such large crowds without any issues."" The city did not put a curfew in place Tuesday night as it had on previous nights. By 11:20 p.m., there were about 100 people remaining at Kesey Square, according to the news release. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and saying he couldn’t breathe. The incident was videotaped by bystanders. Floyd's death sparked protests and violence in Minneapolis and in every state around the country. Speakers at Eugene’s latest demonstration said protests would be ongoing and peaceful. Other cities’ responses Portland: The police chief in Portland issued a plea Wednesday to the city’s residents to help its leaders stop the violence that has engulfed the city for five consecutive nights in demonstrations over the death of Floyd. Chief Jami Resch said at a news conference that a peaceful march and rally Tuesday that attracted more than 10,000 people was marred when several hundred people broke off late and confronted police officers guarding a building that holds police headquarters and a sheriff’s detention center. The repeated nights of mayhem have rattled even liberal Portland, which has such a storied history of protest that the late president George H. W. Bush dubbed it ""Little Beirut."" Salem: More than 200 demonstrators met at the Oregon State Capitol on Tuesday evening for a fourth night of protests, the first night that has remained peaceful. Tuesday's event in Salem, led by organizer Jonathan Jones, included participants who sang songs, waved signs, chanted and even danced throughout the evening until crowds disbursed at the 11 p.m. curfew. ""I want (tonight) to be the interlude between the anger,"" Jones said. City of Salem officials extended the curfew for six more nights, from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. through Monday, to help the Salem Police Department maintain public safety and prevent further destruction and violence. Only a handful of people were left standing on the Capitol steps after 11 p.m. Salem officers asked remaining individuals to move along. There were no arrests made by Salem Police as of 11:15 p.m. Seattle: Large crowds marched through the city and demonstrations were mostly peaceful until late in the night, when Seattle police used tear gas and flash-bang grenades to disperse a crowd near a police precinct. Seattle police say some people in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood began throwing objects at officers. There were no immediate reports of arrests. On Tuesday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed hundreds of demonstrators and encouraged them to keep marching and keep it peaceful. ""Your voices holding me accountable are important and you should continue to raise them,"" Durkan told those assembled outside the city’s Emergency Operations Center downtown. Durkan and protest leaders planned to meet Wednesday.

As protesters march side by side, they risked spreading and contracting the virus that can now infect thousands of households. COVID-19 testing sites may also not be accessible, limiting diagnoses of the deadly disease. Marchers, some not wearing masks, can be seen chanting, and in some cases screaming, during protests and demonstrations this week. “When people are yelling or speaking in a loud voice, you do have more projection of saliva. And with that, potentially (the) virus,” Chicago Public Health Department’s Dr. Allison Arwady said. Packed-in, moving crowds also do not allow protesters to stay a safe distance away from each other. “One of the reasons we always make that 6-foot recommendation and have the cloth face covering recommendation, is those are the two best ways to prevent transmission,” Arwady said. Now, before mass infections spread, health experts and officials in cities like Chicago are urging anyone who participated in the protest to self isolate. “Please, in exercising your First Amendment rights, or if you were out for any other reason, you have now put yourself at risk and we need you to isolate yourself,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We need you to think about, and be conscious of, whether you are experiencing any signs or symptoms.” “My worry is that we’ve already seen this so disproportionately impact black and brown communities in Chicago,” Arwady said. “What I want is for all of us, especially those communities, is to get on the other side of COVID here. And so if people can do these things that help keep themselves safe, help keep their close contacts safe, it’s in the best interest of them and then really the whole city.” Protesters are urged to stay far away from their family member in high coronavirus risk due to diabetes, heart disease, asthma, age or obesity. “I really want people to recognize that over these next 14 days … I don’t want you in close contact with people who have those underlying conditions or people who are over 60 because you have a higher potential than you did previously to spread it,” Arwady said. “Nothing has changed about COVID and the problem is the virus doesn’t care what else is going on. The virus is just looking for opportunities to spread.” Testing in Chicago was halted Monday – even for people with symptoms – as the Illinois Department of public health was concerned about staff and potential patient safety. However, the city of Chicago has plenty of testing sites through hospitals and clinics. If you have symptoms, the message is, “Get tested.”",0.0
1624351688,2020-06-03 09:49:37,Wheeler to address night 5 of Portland protests,https://www.koin.com/local/multnomah-county/wheeler-night-5-portland-protests/,en,False,"politics and government, police, demonstrations and riots",1406,koin cbs,http://www.koinlocal6.com/default.aspx,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced that he will again not be enforcing a city curfew for Wednesday night while he and other city leaders are addressed the fifth night of protests. The fifth night of protests throughout Portland ultimately ended with around a dozen arrests — out of thousands of peaceful demonstrators — throughout Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. In the conference, Wheeler said he will not be enforcing a city curfew for Wednesday night, saying after doing a bit of soul searching, he concluded that the curfew does not make a meaningful difference — and in some cases, may even make people more highly motivated. Although some violence took place Tuesday night, Wheeler again thanked the peaceful demonstrators along with the Portland Police Bureau. “Our officers are doing everything they can within our power to respect and protect peaceful demonstrators, but they have another job and that job is to make sure that lives are safe public safety is protected. That’s why we cannot tolerate violence,” Wheeler said. “It’s our duty to protect Portland, including the 10,000 people who showed up last night to make this city a more equitable and more just place. “I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again until I reach every single Portlander: keep holding us accountable — all of us. I want to be held accountable. That is the core of our democracy. I want you to know I continue to keep holding myself accountable as mayor. But remember — while you’re doing this, I am your ally. I believe in justice and reform and I believe in our peaceful demonstrators and their calls for reform.” Wheeler went into detail on the various steps he plans to take in order to make changes aligning with the values of the community. “I’ve been out in the community talking to community demonstrators, community leaders, activists and others about what we can do right now,” he said. “We will push for even more changes in state law this summer — some bills are already in the works like the one I support on making sure officers who are disciplined for wrongful behavior don’t get let off the hook. We will also accelerate the conversation on taking a hard look at our speciality units within the Portland Police Bureau. We’ll review our training of police officers to ensure their training aligns with the community’s values. We’ll continue to hold the painful but necessary convos with the community about the history that brought us to this place and discuss solutions that allows us to begin to heal. That is a start. “Change isn’t just coming — it is finally here now.” PPB Chief Jami Resch took the podium to detail what she saw overnight as the peaceful protests turned unruly due to a number of rioters. “I want to recognize the thousands of demonstrators who came downtown in a peaceful manner and exercised their first amendment rights,” Resch said. “There are many thousands of you that are not involved in violence and destruction and I thank you. I still hear your message and know those who are engaging in criminal acts do not represent you.” She went on to say fireworks, ball bearings and projectiles were thrown at officers. She also addressed how and why police are marking vehicles during these protests. “For the past several days we have observed vehicles in the crowd. Some of the occupants of those vehicles have been engaged in activities, suppling weapons and other items to protesters. We have attempted to stop these vehicles in the past couple days and they have fled. This places protesters in and police in extreme danger.” They’ve deployed strategies including stop sticks in some instances and also marking as a way to identify these vehicles and stop them at a later time. She said they saw this as the least intrusive option. “We are at a critical time in our city and in our nation,” she said. “We have to collectively come together to prevent and stop those who are holding our city with violence.” From there, Chief Resch addressed concerns over videos circulating on social media. “Every use of force by a Portland Police Bureau member is documented and investigated. If any actions are found to be out of policy, those actions will be addressed,” Resch said. “I will not let the actions of a few individuals intent on causing violence turn this focus on the Portland Police Bureau. “A group of individuals broke away from a peaceful protest and marched blocks specifically to encounter Portland Police Bureau members at barricades. The PPB did not instigate the violence that began in our city last night.” Chief Resch also answered questions concerning a video circulating of PPB officers driving through barricades. She said the incident is being investigated and cannot speculate at this time. Next, the Portland Office of Equity and Human Rights Director Markisha Smith spoke to the experiences the black community is facing. “Black folks in this country are suffocating,” she began. “Literally — as many have taken their last breath at the hands of police brutality and metaphorically — as community who was struggling under the weight of racism. The events that have transpired over the past few day s and nights highlight the reality threat COVID-19 pandemic has not erased the reality that racism still exists. White supremacy and white supremacists are not following the stay at home order. Racism hasn’t been quarantined. “As protesters have organized in cities across this country, including right there in the city of Portland, it is painfully clear that black folks are tired and that empty words and promising for reform or no longer enough,” said Smith. “While the vast majority of the black community would not condone violence and looting, the reality is that when over 400 years of oppression continue to play out in our communities, there is a tipping point. “Black folks can no longer be responsible for carrying the burden of white fragility, white guilt, trying to fix a system that was never designed for them in the first place — and is simultaneously mourning the death and destruction happening in our communities. “We have to take what is on paper and make it happen. This must be a collective acknowledgment of the pain and trauma the black community is facing and a collective commitment to working with the black community to find actionable steps that are authentic and sustainable.” Peaceful day of Portland protests ends in clashes 5th night of protests largely peaceful despite ending with arrests The protests began on Tuesday with two large groups holding peaceful demonstrations in various parts of Portland. Thousands gathered in Pioneer Courthouse Square while another large crowd marched back and forth across the Burnside Bridge. Hundreds more gathered for a peaceful march earlier in the day in Tualatin. The previous night’s large protest remained peaceful, prompting Mayor Ted Wheeler’s decision to not impose a curfew Tuesday night, which he announced in his press conference earlier in the day. Photos: 5th night of Portland protests, June 2, 2020 Tuesday’s peaceful demonstrations lasted for hours until just after 9 p.m. when Portland police said “criminal activity” occurred at SW 4th and Taylor. Officers later praised the groups who had remained peaceful all day but said a splinter group in the hundreds tried to tear down boundary fencing protecting the area around the Justice Center. Around 12:30 a.m., police declared an unlawful assembly as some people lit fireworks and threw objects at officers — to which police began firing tear gas and other munition in response. Resch clarified that the PPB does not use flash grenades. Police said they made over a dozen arrests throughout the night, though the exact number is unclear. Officers say they continued to ask for compliance and thanked those who obeyed requests to leave the area. At one point overnight, Resch said one truck attempted to hit officers. Chief Resch says they had to develop tactics to deal with cars and trucks in these instances. Despite all this — most of the night was largely peaceful as thousands gathered throughout downtown Portland in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. It is extremely important to note that throughout the last few nights in Portland, peaceful demonstrators have made clear that those participating in violence and looting are not associated with their movement. Chief Resch said she understands the majority of people were there to protest peacefully and this small group of violent demonstrators does not represent the whole.
