The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: "" Montana outbreak tied to golf and country club developed by Charles Schwab "" Pasta factory in Spokane reports virus outbreak as Washington state prepare to reopen "" Sunday's New York Times devotes entire front page to list of COVID-19 victims. "" Protesters gather outside California's state Capitol to rally against stay-at-home orders. "" New York state records 24-hour death total under 100. ___ HAMILTON, Mont. "" An outbreak of COVID-19 in western Montana is tied to an exclusive golf and country club developed by financial executive Charles Schwab. Stock Farm Club General Manager Steve Buck says the eight people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Ravalli County are employees of the club near Hamilton. One person had been hospitalized and seven others remained in isolation on Saturday. The health department has said it was believed the first person who tested positive had contracted the respiratory virus outside the county. Montana reported no new positive COVID-19 tests from samples run on Friday. The state has had 479 confirmed cases. ___ ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Baseball League has canceled its summer season, as the future of sports worldwide remains uncertain during the coronavirus pandemic. The summer league season was scheduled to begin on June 29. The league website says this season will be canceled to keep everyone safe from exposure to COVID-19. KTVA-TV reported that if competition resumed on time there would have been travel and housing challenges during the seven weeks of play. The five-team league is made up of college players from mostly the Lower 48 but also from places as far away as Taiwan. ___ SPOKANE, Wash. "" A pasta company has announced there was a coronavirus outbreak at its Spokane factory as Washington state prepares to reopen parts of its economy. The Spokesman-Review reported that Philadelphia Macaroni Company Inc. said in a statement Friday that 72 workers were tested for COVID-19 and 24 were positive. Health officials say there was an increase in Spokane County with 31 new positive cases between Thursday and Friday. Company officials say all of the factory employees have since been tested and the facility was disinfected. The company is working with the Spokane Regional Health District to conduct contact tracing and determine further prevention measures. ___ BEIJING "" China on Sunday reported three new confirmed cases of coronavirus. Two of the cases were brought from outside the country and one locally transmitted in the northeastern province of Jilin that has experienced a minor outbreak now apparently largely contained. No new deaths were reported and 79 people remain in treatment, with another 380 under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or having tested positive for COVID-19 without showing any symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 COVID-19 deaths out of 82,974 cases. ___ CANBERRA, Australia "" Government officials says six million Australians have downloaded a mobile telephone app that helps health authorities trace coronavirus infections Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the COVIDSafe app is playing a strong role in Australia's response to the pandemic and several countries have expressed interest in learning from its positive impacts. If a user is diagnosed, the app works to identify other users who have been in close proximity for 15 minutes or more in the previous three weeks. The government has said at least 40% of Australia's 26 million people need to use the app for it to be effective. There are approximately 17 million mobile phones in Australia. The government and states have been easing restrictions on travel and increased use of restaurants and bars in the past few weeks. Australia has recorded more than 7,100 cases of COVID-19, with 102 deaths. ___ NEW YORK "" The New York Times has devoted Sunday's entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline 'U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,' with a subheadline reading: 'They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us.' The all-text list takes the place of the usual articles, photographs and graphics in an effort to convey the vastness and variety of lives lost, according to Simone Landon, assistant editor of the graphics desk. A tally kept by Johns Hopkins University says more than 96,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States. Tom Bodkin, chief creative officer of The Times, said he did not remember any front pages without images, though there have been pages with only graphics, during his 40 years at the newspaper. ___ SANTA FE, N.M. "" A New Mexico state official says gatherings of more than 100 people may not be possible for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Tourism Secretary Jen Paul Schroer said it could be a year or 18 months before there's either a vaccine or herd immunity. That creates the prospect that sports stadiums, concert halls and conference centers in the state could remain empty for months. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports that Schroer spoke during a webinar Thursday on reopening the state's hospitality industry. The state had nearly 6,800 cases of COVID-19 with 308 deaths as of Saturday. ___ SACRAMENTO, Calif. "" Hundreds of protesters rallied outside California's state Capitol on Saturday to protest stay-at-home orders even as residents entered the Memorial Day weekend with newly expanded options for leisure. California Highway Patrol officers closed the Capitol lawn to demonstrators, so speakers addressed the crowd from the back of a flatbed truck as an airplane flew above towing a banner with a picture of Gov. Gavin Newsom and the words 'End his tyranny!' Protesters waved dozens of flags and signs, many in support of President Donald Trump. Few people wore masks and there was little room for social distancing. The protest came as restrictions eased across much of the state. Some 45 of 58 counties have received permission to reopen most stores and many public spaces by meeting state standards for controlling the novel coronavirus. Authorities continue to warn people to practice social distancing and other anti-virus measures, noting that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise. ___ HAGATNA, Guam "" The Department of Agriculture in Guam has invited hunters to participate in a pig-hunting derby to provide food for families in need during the coronavirus pandemic. The Pacific Daily News reported that the department announced that the two-day derby is scheduled to begin next Saturday. The department released a statement saying the derby is intended to feed families, foster familial hunter development and reduce the feral pig population. Event organizers are working with mayors to distribute pigs whole and unprocessed to residents within their villages and provide safe handling guidelines. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" Coronavirus outbreaks at meat processing plants are forcing North Carolina farmers to euthanize 1.5 million chickens, according to a state official. Assistant Agriculture Commissioner Joe Reardon told The News & Observer that this is the first time during the pandemic that farmers in the state have had to euthanize their animals. Roughly a third of the 1.5 million chickens already had been killed, Reardon said. Chicken and hog farmers in other states also have been euthanizing millions of animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. North Carolina hog farmers have not taken steps to euthanize their animals, Reardon said. ___ FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. "" Eighteen soldiers assigned to the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division have returned to Fort Campbell after spending more than a month in New Jersey helping with COVID-19 response operations. Fort Campbell officials say the soldiers deployed April 14 to help provide logistical support for the response to the new coronavirus outbreak throughout the Northeast. The troops helped receive, process and move supplies, equipment and personnel in critical areas affected by the virus outbreak. The soldiers will undergo a precautionary quarantine under medical supervision. An official welcome-home event is being planned, officials said. The Fort Campbell Army post is located along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scrapping his 10-person limit on group gatherings and allowing churches to open at 25% occupancy if certain safety guidelines are met. Walz's decision comes after the state reported a record number of COVID-19 cases. He says the issue has been 'a challenging one' because large gatherings raise the risk of spreading the virus. Walz says he understands the toll the pandemic has taken on the spiritual health of residents. His new executive order applies only to religious gatherings and not receptions. While the leader of the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis welcomed the change, the governor said parishes should not open if they don't feel they can meet safety measures. Archbishop Bernard Hebda said in a letter to parishioners that limiting gatherings to 10 people had 'burdened the Church's ability to fully meet the sacramental needs of our faithful.' ___ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. "" A woman who raised questions about Florida's COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data's curator had been reprimanded several times for violating Health Department policy, including for posting political commentary about the information, state records show. Rebekah Jones' comments over the past week and a half in emails to researchers, interviews with a handful of media outlets, and blog posts have sought to sow doubt about the credibility of the data now that she is no longer in that role. State health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information's accuracy as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state's battered economy following safer-at-home orders. Jones has not alleged any tampering with data on deaths, hospital symptom surveillance, hospitalizations for COVID-19, numbers of new confirmed cases, or overall testing rates. She has, however, suggested Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. ___ SPRINGFIELD, Mo. "" A hairstylist served 84 clients over eight days recently while experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, Missouri health officials say. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department said in a news briefing that the stylist worked between May 12-20 and announced in a Facebook post Saturday that 56 other clients were potentially exposed by a second stylist who worked five shifts from May 16-20 while experiencing very mild symptoms of the coronavirus. All clients of the two stylists wore masks and will be tested. The owner of the business said in a statement that the salon will be closed until it goes through sanitizing and deep cleaning The state health department reported 218 new confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total to 11,558 since the pandemic began. That was the largest one-day total since 319 cases were reported May 1. Ten new deaths brought that total to 671. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" North Carolina has failed to change its election laws to ensure that voters can safely cast ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic, voting rights advocates claim in a federal lawsuit. The nonprofit Democracy North Carolina and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina sued Friday on behalf of several elderly or disabled residents whose medical conditions make them more vulnerable to coronavirus. The lawsuit alleges that several aspects of North Carolina's absentee vote-by-mail requirements are unconstitutional because voters will have to risk exposure to COVID-19 to successfully vote. For example, mail-in absentee voters are required to complete the ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. State law also requires voters to submit their registration applications at least 25 days before the election or else register in-person at an early voting site, the suit notes. The lawsuit says that will result in millions of state residents either losing their right to vote or being forced to compromise their health in order to cast a ballot. The state Board of Elections and other state officials are named as defendants. ___ STURGIS, S.D. "" The mayor of Sturgis says city officials can't stop people from coming to the annual motorcycle gathering in the Black Hills of South Dakota, regardless of the new coronavirus. The 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is scheduled for Aug. 7-16. The City Council has said it would make an official decision in mid-June on whether to go forward with hosting the event, the Rapid City Journal reported. Mayor Mark Carstensen said in a Facebook video that 'tourism is coming' to the Black Hills and Sturgis. A manager with The Hotel Sturgis said all 22 rooms have been booked for the week of the rally and there is a waiting list. ___ DOVER, Del. "" The University of Delaware says it is laying off more than 1,100 part-time employees, mostly students, in a move to cut costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The News Journal reports that students account for 805 of the 1,146 part-time employees who were notified of their layoffs on Thursday. An email to employees said the layoffs, which take effect on June 1, do not affect adjunct faculty, graduate students, work-study students or employees whose wages are paid through external funding. But many adjunct professors will not have a teaching position in the fall due to a hiring freeze. In April, the university announced that it faced a $65 million budget shortfall due to pandemic's financial toll, including revenue lost from prorated housing and canceled athletic events. The university hopes to reopen campus in phases starting June 1 with certain research facilities. ___ BAGHDAD "" Iraq's Health Ministry is reporting the steepest single-day spike in confirmed coronavirus cases since the government began recording cases in late February. The ministry reported 308 new cases Saturday, one day ahead of celebrations to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Curfew hours had been relaxed during the month of fasting, which contributed to higher daily rates of infection. According to ministry figures, more than 4,200 people have tested positive for the virus in Iraq. At least 152 people have died. Roads have been clogged with traffic and supermarkets and shops have been packed with people preparing for the celebrations, likely contributing to the increase in infections. ___ ALBANY, N.Y. "" New York state reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths in weeks in what Gov. Andrew Cuomo described Saturday as a critical benchmark. The daily death tally was 84 after a peak of 799 on April 8. Reducing the state's daily death count to fewer than 100 seemed almost impossible several weeks ago, the Democratic governor said. That figure has remained stubbornly high even amid other signs of encouragement. 'In my head, I was always looking to get under 100,' Cuomo said. 'For me, it's a sign that we're making real progress.' The number of hospitalized patients in the state that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. continued to fall, dropping to over 4,600. Cuomo also announced that the region along the Hudson River north of New York City and south of Albany is set to begin reopening Tuesday, and that Long Island could follow suit Wednesday. ___ ATHENS "" Two fatalities from COVID-19 were reported in Greece during the most recent 24-hour period, bringing the death toll to 171, health authorities announced Saturday. Another three new infections have been recorded since Friday afternoon, raising the nation's total to 2,876. The number of patients on ventilators stands at 20, while 99 have left intensive care. Greek authorities say they have performed 152,998 tests for the disease. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0
1616358911,2020-05-25 14:26:52,Israeli leader vows to push ahead with annexing West Bank,https://www.gadsdentimes.com/ZZ/news/20200525/israeli-leader-vows-to-push-ahead-with-annexing-west-bank?rssfeed=true,en,True,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"JERUSALEM (AP) "" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pledged to annex parts of the occupied West Bank in the coming months, vowing to move ahead with the explosive plan despite a growing chorus of condemnations by key allies. The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Annexing large chunks of this territory would all but destroy the faint remaining hopes of a two-state solution. In an apparent reference to the friendly administration of President Donald Trump, Netanyahu said Israel had a 'historic opportunity' to redraw the Mideast map that could not be missed. Israeli media quoted him as saying he would act in July. 'This is an opportunity that we will not let pass,' he told members of his conservative Likud party. He added that the 'historic opportunity' to annex the West Bank had never before occurred since Israel's founding in 1948. The comments threatened to push Israel closer to a confrontation with Arab and European partners, and could deepen what is becoming a growing partisan divide over Israel in Washington. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. It has settled nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory, but never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition. But the Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. Trump's Mideast team is dominated by advisers with close ties to the settlements, and his Mideast plan, unveiled in January, envisions leaving some 30% of the territory under permanent Israeli control while giving the Palestinians expanded autonomy in the rest of the area. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, saying it is unfairly biased toward Israel. With Trump's re-election prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader's new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government in July. Netanyahu told party members in a closed-door meeting that 'we have a target date for July and we don't intend to change it,"" Likud officials said. The plan has already exposed a partisan divide in Washington. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee in the U.S. presidential elections, recently said that annexation would 'choke off' hopes for a two-state solution. 18 Democratic senators warned in a letter this week that annexation could harm U.S.-Israeli ties. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said annexation would violate international law and vowed to use 'all our diplomatic capacities' to stop it. Closer to home, the Palestinians last week cut off security ties "" a valuable tool in a shared struggled against Islamic militants "" with Israel to protest the annexation plan. Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that maintains behind-the-scenes relations with Israel, announced its 'rejection of the Israeli measures and plans to annex Palestinian lands.' The Arab League has condemned it as a 'war crime,' and both Jordan and Egypt "" the only two Arab countries at peace with Israel "" have harshly criticized it. Netanyahu spoke a day after beginning his trial on corruption charges. The prime minister launched a blistering tirade against the country's legal system when he arrived at court, accusing police, prosecutors and media of conspiring to oust him. As he spoke, hundreds of supporters cheered outside. Speaking to Likud on Monday, Netanyahu said he was 'very moved' by the support. Critics have said his attacks on the justice system risk undermining the country's democratic foundations.",0.0

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0
1617119309,2020-05-26 10:53:12,Man dies in police custody after video shows Minneapolis officer kneeling on his neck,https://whnt.com/news/man-dies-in-police-custody-after-video-shows-minneapolis-officer-kneeling-on-his-neck/,en,True,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A black man has died in Minneapolis police custody after video shared online from a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man’s neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect’s description in his car. “He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” Elder said in a statement. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn’t immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her “sick to her stomach” and she said it’s another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. “Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,” she said. “What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.” Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn’t breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a “need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,” and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. “If you’re sad, I get it, if you’re angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,” Frey said. “There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19.” Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers’ gun when he was shot. A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call. That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.",0.0

The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was 'no need for us to worry"" over the move being considered by China's ceremonial National People's Congress. 'Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,"" Lam said. 'Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.' Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong's international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. In Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that President Donald Trump is ""displeased with China's efforts and that it's hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub, if China takes over.' She declined to elaborate when asked to explain the statement further. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government's determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year's street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. Some 'foreign politicians' have 'expressed untrue opinions' about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target 'a minority,' citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong's streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong's Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong's government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law "" its mini-constitution "" to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem "" as often seen at soccer games "" along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong's Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi's tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China's intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi's difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0
1617796796,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Shuttle Veteran Leads First Human Space Mission Launched From U.S. Since 2011,https://www.apr.org/post/shuttle-veteran-leads-first-human-space-mission-launched-us-2011,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"When NASA astronauts launch from the Kennedy Space Center, it will be the first time humans have blasted off from the U.S. since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm joined by MORNING EDITION poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander. Hi, Kwame. KWAME ALEXANDER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So last time you were here, Kwame, you and I encouraged our listeners to really look for the protective nature of poetry and to write a poem in response to the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. He is the black man who was chased down by two white men and killed last February when he was out jogging. ALEXANDER: I still struggle to grapple with what it means to be black and safe in America. Did you know that in the weeks following Arbery's death, three more African Americans were killed under police brutality? Sean Reed's death in Indianapolis, recorded live on social media. Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician in Louisville, was shot eight times in her bed. And just Monday night, Rachel, in south Minneapolis, another black man died in police custody. His name is George Floyd. There's video of him pleading with an officer, who's on his neck. We hear him crying out, I can't breathe. MARTIN: Which, of course, were the last words of Eric Garner, who was killed at the hands of police in New York in 2014. And it is an impossible reality to try to reconcile. How do we face our best selves when we are confronted with this truth that is unfathomable and unjust? ALEXANDER: I don't know. I recall a Toni Morrison quote. She said, ""This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak. We write. We do language."" MARTIN: The art that comes from hurt is a compelling force, right? It can be formidable. And you are doing your part in that with your poems. We got over a thousand entries from our listeners, an emotional outpouring of poems, reflections about America, America today. ALEXANDER: Look; I know I sound like a broken record here, but, wow, I was blown away with the heart, the anger, the angst and the hope in all of these submissions. MARTIN: So you took them and combined them into many words and one voice. ALEXANDER: Yeah. But, Rachel, our listeners, they write these muscular and moving poems and reflections. I'm just honored to be able to bring them together. So this is our crowdsource community poem ""Running For Your Life."" MARTIN: OK. ALEXANDER: What is the color of air? Who owns the right to breathe? Why are we so afraid of each other? When will they come for the brown men I know and love? What was his crime? MARTIN: Is there justice for all in the land of the free, or only those who are white like me? What is the vaccine for this pandemic? I wonder where my baby is. ALEXANDER: Another black body shot. White-hot hate left its stain on a blackened Georgia road. MARTIN: My country, tis of thee. We must raise the skeletons buried deep in our past. ALEXANDER: 1880, 1890, 1920, 1990, 2020 - give it time, white fragility says. Nothing moves forward until this hunting stops a knife on our collective tongues. MARTIN: Please stop running from the truth and listen. This death was everyone's fault. This is on you, young America. We must accept the lingering shame and guilt, the anger and mistrust inequality have instilled, apologize for the damage, commit to sow a future with humility. ALEXANDER: While we await such a day, let us say your name, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery. I am sorry that we all know your name now, that we will forget it far too soon. MARTIN: I am sorry that the only song they know to sing for you is tragedy. I am sorry that all I can do is write this poem. I am sorry that your life has become a metaphor. ALEXANDER: My heart rages for another mother's loss of her son, for the blindness, for the cover-up, for the tears not enough to wet the graves of so many lost for the sake of insanity. MARTIN: A black babysitter caring for white children, a black professor opening his own front door, a young black woman sleeping in her own college lounge, a black teen knocking on a door to ask directions - his first words, don't be afraid - a black boy jogging in the morning. There is an essential difference between running and running for your life. ALEXANDER: I remember my mother, the night she got down on her hands and knees on the frayed rug, tired of the facade of racial progress, pain too hard to bear, fist pumping out the beat, I can't take it anymore. I don't fear the pickup trucks. It's only the dogs sometimes, when there are two or more, and mean, who charge out onto the road, hair raised along their backs, barking and growling, coming up behind me, looking for a chance to bite. My deepest fear is that I am black and that I will be murdered for it. MARTIN: They are young men simply going about their lives. Never, ever again should a dream be deferred, should a parent have to explain Jim Crow still lives in the hearts and minds of white men, should a young man look over his shoulder at a gun and run only to lose this race. ALEXANDER: Never, ever again. We do have a choice, and it is an easy choice. We fight to rise above this sin. MARTIN: We fight to be a world of one. ALEXANDER: We fight for our humanity, because after leaves fall, they cannot be reattached to the tree. MARTIN: Because broken hearts still beat. ALEXANDER: Because Justice peeks her head around the corner and hope the door doesn't slam. MARTIN: I don't really have any words after that. I think those words... ALEXANDER: Yeah, the listeners gave us the words. They gave us what we needed there. MARTIN: Yeah, they did. And we thank them for that and you. MORNING EDITION poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander.

In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And I'm joined by MORNING EDITION poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander. Hi, Kwame. KWAME ALEXANDER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So last time you were here, Kwame, you and I encouraged our listeners to really look for the protective nature of poetry and to write a poem in response to the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. He is the black man who was chased down by two white men and killed last February when he was out jogging. ALEXANDER: I still struggle to grapple with what it means to be black and safe in America. Did you know that in the weeks following Arbery's death, three more African Americans were killed under police brutality? Sean Reed's death in Indianapolis, recorded live on social media. Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician in Louisville, was shot eight times in her bed. And just Monday night, Rachel, in south Minneapolis, another black man died in police custody. His name is George Floyd. There's video of him pleading with an officer, who's on his neck. We hear him crying out, I can't breathe. MARTIN: Which, of course, were the last words of Eric Garner, who was killed at the hands of police in New York in 2014. And it is an impossible reality to try to reconcile. How do we face our best selves when we are confronted with this truth that is unfathomable and unjust? ALEXANDER: I don't know. I recall a Toni Morrison quote. She said, ""This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak. We write. We do language."" MARTIN: The art that comes from hurt is a compelling force, right? It can be formidable. And you are doing your part in that with your poems. We got over a thousand entries from our listeners, an emotional outpouring of poems, reflections about America, America today. ALEXANDER: Look; I know I sound like a broken record here, but, wow, I was blown away with the heart, the anger, the angst and the hope in all of these submissions. MARTIN: So you took them and combined them into many words and one voice. ALEXANDER: Yeah. But, Rachel, our listeners, they write these muscular and moving poems and reflections. I'm just honored to be able to bring them together. So this is our crowdsource community poem ""Running For Your Life."" MARTIN: OK. ALEXANDER: What is the color of air? Who owns the right to breathe? Why are we so afraid of each other? When will they come for the brown men I know and love? What was his crime? MARTIN: Is there justice for all in the land of the free, or only those who are white like me? What is the vaccine for this pandemic? I wonder where my baby is. ALEXANDER: Another black body shot. White-hot hate left its stain on a blackened Georgia road. MARTIN: My country, tis of thee. We must raise the skeletons buried deep in our past. ALEXANDER: 1880, 1890, 1920, 1990, 2020 - give it time, white fragility says. Nothing moves forward until this hunting stops a knife on our collective tongues. MARTIN: Please stop running from the truth and listen. This death was everyone's fault. This is on you, young America. We must accept the lingering shame and guilt, the anger and mistrust inequality have instilled, apologize for the damage, commit to sow a future with humility. ALEXANDER: While we await such a day, let us say your name, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery. I am sorry that we all know your name now, that we will forget it far too soon. MARTIN: I am sorry that the only song they know to sing for you is tragedy. I am sorry that all I can do is write this poem. I am sorry that your life has become a metaphor. ALEXANDER: My heart rages for another mother's loss of her son, for the blindness, for the cover-up, for the tears not enough to wet the graves of so many lost for the sake of insanity. MARTIN: A black babysitter caring for white children, a black professor opening his own front door, a young black woman sleeping in her own college lounge, a black teen knocking on a door to ask directions - his first words, don't be afraid - a black boy jogging in the morning. There is an essential difference between running and running for your life. ALEXANDER: I remember my mother, the night she got down on her hands and knees on the frayed rug, tired of the facade of racial progress, pain too hard to bear, fist pumping out the beat, I can't take it anymore. I don't fear the pickup trucks. It's only the dogs sometimes, when there are two or more, and mean, who charge out onto the road, hair raised along their backs, barking and growling, coming up behind me, looking for a chance to bite. My deepest fear is that I am black and that I will be murdered for it. MARTIN: They are young men simply going about their lives. Never, ever again should a dream be deferred, should a parent have to explain Jim Crow still lives in the hearts and minds of white men, should a young man look over his shoulder at a gun and run only to lose this race. ALEXANDER: Never, ever again. We do have a choice, and it is an easy choice. We fight to rise above this sin. MARTIN: We fight to be a world of one. ALEXANDER: We fight for our humanity, because after leaves fall, they cannot be reattached to the tree. MARTIN: Because broken hearts still beat. ALEXANDER: Because Justice peeks her head around the corner and hope the door doesn't slam. MARTIN: I don't really have any words after that. I think those words... ALEXANDER: Yeah, the listeners gave us the words. They gave us what we needed there. MARTIN: Yeah, they did. And we thank them for that and you. MORNING EDITION poet-in-residence Kwame Alexander.

1618011117,2020-05-27 09:39:54,Hundreds gathered at the Minneapolis intersection where George Floyd died after police encounter,https://whnt.com/news/hundreds-gathered-at-the-minneapolis-intersection-where-george-floyd-died-after-police-encounter/,en,False,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"(CNN) — About 24 hours after George Floyd’s death, hundreds of protesters packed the streets of Minneapolis, many gathering at the intersection where Floyd was pinned to the ground by police officers shortly before he died. Floyd was arrested Monday evening after officers responded to a call about an alleged forgery in progress. Video from bystanders shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned to the ground and one police officer’s knee pressing against his neck. Floyd pleaded he was in pain and couldn’t breathe. Shortly after, he died at a nearby hospital. Four police officers involved in the incident were fired Tuesday, Minneapolis police said. Tuesday evening, protests started at the intersection where Floyd was arrested. Protesters later moved to one of the police precincts, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. Some demonstrators chanted “No justice, no peace” — as well as “I can’t breathe,” which were some of the last words Floyd uttered Monday in the bystander video. Demonstrators and officers in riot gear faced each other as police sent tear gas canisters into crowds. “We’re here to let them know this can’t be tolerated, there will be severe consequences if they continue to kill us. This will not go on another day,” a protester told the affiliate. Tear gas used after crowd turned unruly, police say Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd after some protesters turned unruly, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder told CNN. Some demonstrators wheeled a shopping cart full of rocks just outside the precinct and dumped the rocks on the ground for people to throw, a CNN team there reported. A police cruiser’s back window was shattered when someone threw something at it. Police outside Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct fired what appeared to CNN’s team on the scene to be non-lethal projectiles at demonstrators. Officers fired “foam marking rounds,” but no rubber bullets, after some protesters became unruly, Elder said. Those rounds are meant to mark individuals that officers believe may be instigating violence for later investigation, Elder said. Family: Officers should be charged with murder No charges in the case have been filed. Members of Floyd’s family say they want four officers at the scene charged with murder. “They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn’t see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life. Not one of them tried to do anything to help him,” Tera Brown, Floyd’s cousin, told CNN’s Don Lemon on Tuesday. Brown and Floyd’s two brothers held up his picture during Tuesday’s interview and spoke of a man who “didn’t hurt anybody” and who they described as a “gentle giant.” “Knowing my brother is to love my brother,” Philonise Floyd said. “They could have tased him; they could have maced him. Instead, they put their knee in his neck and just sat on him and then carried on.” “They treated him worse than they treat animals,” he said. “They need to be charged with murder because what they did was murder,” Brown said. “And almost the whole world has witnessed that because somebody was gracious enough to record it.” “They need to pay for what they did,” she said. ‘I can’t breathe’ Minneapolis police said officers were responding to a report of a forgery Monday evening and were told a person later described as the suspect was sitting on a car. They found Floyd, who at that point was inside a car and police said he “physically resisted” after he got out of the vehicle. Officers handcuffed Floyd, who police said “appeared to be suffering medical distress.” Video captured by bystanders shows an officer with his knee pressed against the neck of the 46-year-old, who was handcuffed on the pavement. Two officers handled the man on the ground while another stood nearby with his eyes on the bystanders as traffic passed. “Please, I can’t breathe,” Floyd says. “… My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts.” At one point the man said, “Give me some water or something. Please. Please.” Floyd screamed for several minutes before he became silent. Bystanders urged the officer to release the man from his hold. He died at a hospital shortly after, police said. Surveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant showed the first point of contact police had with the man. An officer escorts Floyd handcuffed out of a car and Floyd sits on the sidewalk. Moments later, the officer and another escort Floyd away, still with his hands behind his back. A finding on Floyd’s cause and manner of death remains pending and it is being investigated by local, state and federal law enforcement, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office said in a statement. Mayor: ‘Being black in America’ should not be ‘a death sentence’ Referencing the moments when Floyd was on the ground, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday the officer had no reason to employ the hold on his neck. “The technique that was used is not permitted; is not a technique that our officers get trained in on,” he said in a town hall streamed on Facebook. “And our chief has been very clear on that piece. There is no reason to apply that kind of pressure with a knee to someone’s neck.” Frey said he “100%” supported the police department’s decision to fire the four officers. He offered his condolences to Floyd’s family, adding that what the video shows was “utterly messed up.” “For five minutes, we watched as a white officer pressed his knee to the neck of a black man,” Frey said in a news conference. “When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense.” “Being black in America,” he added, should not be “a death sentence.” The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the officers were cooperating in an investigation and urged “now is not the time to rush to (judgment)” while the officers’ actions are examined. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into Floyd’s death, which will focus on whether the Minneapolis Police Department officers involved “willfully deprived (Floyd) of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” according to a statement from the FBI Minneapolis Division. The FBI said it will present its findings to the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota for consideration of possible federal charges.",0.0

1618206765,2020-05-27 12:55:17,"LIVE: Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man; Activists, protesters demand justice",https://www.cbs42.com/top-stories/live-swift-firings-for-minneapolis-officers-in-death-of-black-man-activists-protesters-demand-justice/,en,True,,115203,wiat.com,http://wiat.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles, with tense skirmishes stretching late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview Wednesday morning that the officers involved in her brother’s death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she hadn’t watched the bystander’s video, but told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that “I don’t understand how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.” Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: “This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday’s protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” And some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant’s owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father.",0.0
1618305575,2020-05-27 14:35:00,George Floyd's Death Stokes Calls For Minneapolis Officers To Be Charged,https://www.apr.org/post/george-floyds-death-stokes-calls-minneapolis-officers-be-charged,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET Just one day after the death of a black man whose arrest was recorded and posted on social media by a passerby, Minneapolis is grappling with the fallout that has spread beyond city limits. The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

Four Minneapolis officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody, were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd is gasping for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a Minneapolis convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. A smaller protest was underway Wednesday at the same precinct, and another demonstration was planned for later in the day in the suburban neighborhood where Chauvin was believed to live. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Floyd’s death and the recent uproar over the death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the arrest in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” The president was in Florida for the scheduled launch of a SpaceX rocket, which was later canceled because of threatening weather. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the arrest was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” Police are under pressure as more people record officers’ encounters with the public. Officers feel their jobs are misunderstood, and the unpredictable nature of policing makes it hard to explain tactics to the average person unfamiliar with tense, sometimes life-threatening work, policing experts said. A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is already hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told The Associated Press. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was even arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to Floyd’s death. Minneapolis police are conducting an internal investigation, which will center on whether the officers used excessive force through witness accounts, officer accounts and evidence, including prior disciplinary records. The officers have not been publicly identified, though an attorney confirmed he was representing Chauvin. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is also probing the case to determine whether criminal charges are warranted, and will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether the use of force was justified. The county attorney’s office didn’t immediately respond to Frey’s statement. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments before. Chauvin is kneeling on Floyd’s neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, his face pressed to the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” Under Chauvin’s restraint, he slowly becomes motionless. Chauvin does not remove his knee until Floyd is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. In calling for charges, Frey contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly. There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes,” Frey said “Every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.”",0.0

The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family.

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

A large group broke away and got onto the 101 Freeway around 6 p.m., blocking traffic on both sides of the freeway during rush hour as Los Angeles Police Department officers and Los Angeles Fire Department units responded. At one point, some people surrounded a California Highway Patrol car and were seen banging on it and kicking it as the vehicle drove through the crowd on the freeway near Alameda Street. Several climbed onto the car’s hood and then fell off as it drove away, aerial video from Sky5 showed. One person was seen rolling off the hood and hitting the ground as the patrol car sped up. Firefighters were later seen treating the person, who was lying on the ground in the midst of the crowd, before transporting him in an ambulance. Officials did not provide information on the person’s condition. Video showed protestors smashing the rear window of a second patrol car that approached after the person fell. Protestors later marched away from the freeway and towards the Metropolitan Detention Center. The event was largely peaceful, and many were seen wearing face masks and holding signs as they participated. Black Lives Matter, which organized the protest, had asked demonstrators to practice social distancing and wear masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. The protestors raised their fists in solidarity and held up flags and signs saying “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” “We hear your anger & your pain,” the Los Angeles Police Department told demonstrators on Twitter. “We will always facilitate freedom of speech. Period. All we ask is that protests are held in a safe & legal manner.” Because the protestors blocked the freeway, LAPD issued a citywide tactical alert so that there would be more officers available to respond if needed, Officer Mike Lopez said. L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva also released a statement asking demonstrators to keep the protest peaceful. “Violence is unwarranted and takes away from the message. I urge all of us to protest peacefully for the sake of everyone’s public safety,” he said. The group also planned to demonstrate in front of L.A. District Attorney Jackie Lacey’s office to protest in the name of those who died in L.A. police custody. No arrests were made and no other injuries were reported, according to LAPD. Floyd’s death sparked violent protests in Minneapolis for two nights in a row as residents took to the streets to share their anger and grief. The demonstrations come after cellphone video that has gone viral showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck as the 46-year-old man begged, “please, please, please, I can’t breathe,” before he eventually became unresponsive. Today at 4 pm, @BLMLA is leading a demonstration in front of Jackie Lacey’s office.

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” A man poses for photos in front of a fire at an AutoZone store, while protesters hold a rally for George Floyd in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

(Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

1619096770,2020-05-28 10:31:00,Mayor: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged,https://www.wkrg.com/news/mayor-officer-who-put-knee-on-mans-neck-should-be-charged/,en,True,,118429,wkrg.com,http://wkrg.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin’s attorney confirmed the officer’s identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.” LATEST STORIES:",0.0

The American South roundup includes stories and galleries from USA TODAY Network news organizations across our Southern states. This week we continue sharing top news stories from across the South. In Memphis, Tenn. a silent 'Black Lives Matter' demonstration to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery led to verbal confrontations with city police and counter protestors. As restrictions are starting to ease around the country, many businesses, including the film industry in the 'Hollywood of the South' are considering timelines to reopen. Across Tennessee, religious leaders are contemplating timelines too, as many have to decide when to resume in-person worship. Meanwhile in Mississippi, amusement parks and water parks are open, as many believe they are safe from coronavirus infection with social distancing in place and staff wearing masks. Finally, while reopening gives some hope for a rebounded economy, business leaders in tourist-driven cities like Asheville, N.C. aren't all certain. Memphis police closed a section of Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis Wednesday night after a demonstration turned confrontational. The protest was sparked after Floyd's death this week became the latest in a string of violence against black people. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for an extended period.

The American South roundup includes stories and galleries from USA TODAY Network news organizations across our Southern states. This week we continue sharing top news stories from across the South. In Memphis, Tenn. a silent 'Black Lives Matter' demonstration to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery led to verbal confrontations with city police and counter protestors. As restrictions are starting to ease around the country, many businesses, including the film industry in the 'Hollywood of the South' are considering timelines to reopen. Across Tennessee, religious leaders are contemplating timelines too, as many have to decide when to resume in-person worship. Meanwhile in Mississippi, amusement parks and water parks are open, as many believe they are safe from coronavirus infection with social distancing in place and staff wearing masks. Finally, while reopening gives some hope for a rebounded economy, business leaders in tourist-driven cities like Asheville, N.C. aren't all certain. Memphis police closed a section of Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis Wednesday night after a demonstration turned confrontational. The protest was sparked after Floyd's death this week became the latest in a string of violence against black people. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for an extended period. Restrictions are starting to ease around the country, but many businesses are slow to start back up again, the film industry included.

1619494628,2020-05-28 18:41:43,WATCH: Authorities give update on the death of George Floyd amidst violent protests in Minneapolis,https://www.wkrg.com/news/watch-authorities-give-update-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-amidst-violent-protests-in-minneapolis/,en,True,,118429,wkrg.com,http://wkrg.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked a Minneapolis neighborhood for a second straight night as angry crowds looted stores, set fires and left a path of damage that stretched for miles. The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into Thursday morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, Floyd pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a mostly peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued Thursday. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Firefighters were still spraying water onto hot buildings Thursday morning, and some buildings still smoldered, sending a bitter smell into the smoke-filled air. Windows were smashed out of several businesses in a strip mall, including a department store, a charter school and other businesses, and the destruction was visible for blocks. A Wendy’s restaurant was damaged beyond recognition. Inside some of the stores, shelves were toppled and debris strewn about. Video taken inside a damaged Target that had been looted showed empty clothing racks. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. Streets and parking lots were also covered in debris, and many businesses had been spray-painted. There was no sign of a police presence, except around the precinct building, where officers were in riot gear. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Demonstrators also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd’s death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited.",0.0
1619631542,2020-05-28 20:10:33,Trump tries a new response after George Floyd's death,https://www.gadsdentimes.com/ZZ/news/20200528/trump-tries-new-response-after-george-floyds-death?rssfeed=true,en,True,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. 'I feel very, very badly,"" Trump said Thursday of George Floyd's death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. ""That's a very shocking sight.' Once more likely to hew to the 'blue lives matter' mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer's conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations. 'This is the first race-tinged case that I've ever heard him address' as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. 'So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it's empty words because it is so out of character.' White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously. 'This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President's unwavering support for the African-American community,' Deere said, citing Trump's support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities. Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. 'This is something that is a local matter and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,' then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner's dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: 'You have people on both sides of that.' Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump's tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. 'You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,"" he told reporters this month. ""It's a heartbreaking thing.' The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: 'it could be something that we didn't see on tape."" Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn't breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump 'was very upset when he saw that video,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. 'He wants justice to be served.' Trump's conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is ""a big supporter of law enforcement,"" but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: 'The lack of training here is breathtaking.' 'It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,' echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump. 'We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,' said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a 'terrorist group,' said Thursday that Floyd's death was totally 'unjustified' and he was 'so mad.' The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black,' a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation's first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans' response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. 'Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it's just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,"" he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd's death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. 'It's like a father that misses a kid's graduation of high school, graduation of college,"" he said. 'He can't be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he's there when he graduates with his Ph.D."" ___ Associated Press writer Kat Stafford in Detroit contributed to this report.",0.0

1619723012,2020-05-28 22:17:48,We should be fed up- Birmingham activists protest George Floyds death,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2020/05/we-should-be-fed-up-birmingham-activists-protest-george-floyds-death.html,en,False,,658852,Birmingham News as it Happens from Birmingham News.Net,http://www.birminghamnews.net/,"More than 100 demonstrators gathered in Birmingham’s Kelly Ingram Park on Thursday night to protest the death of George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died earlier this week in Minnesota after a police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while handcuffed in an incident that was caught on video and sparked nationwide outrage. Dubbed the Alabama Rally Against Injustice, protest organizers said Floyd’s death and those of other unarmed black men and women in police custody showed that more has to be done then just demonstrating after those incidents. Other than protesting, organizers called on participants to vote in elections and run for office themselves, contending that systemic racism is the issue. Warning: This video contains profanity Protesters hold an Alabama Rally Against Injustice, demonstrating against the death of George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died in Minnesota earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee into him in an incident that was caught on video and sparked nationwide outrage. Posted by al.com on Thursday, May 28, 2020 “We didn’t come here to be nice tonight. We didn’t come here to play around tonight. Hopefully we are here because we are tired of what’s happening,"" said Carlos Chaverst, one of the organizers. ""We should be fed up with seeing black men and women being killed in the street by police.” Police were called to a Minneapolis grocery store on Monday after a worker alleged that the 46-year-old Floyd tried to pay with counterfeit currency. Video surfaced showing one of the officers pressing his knee into a handcuffed Floyd as Floyd complained that he could not breathe. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Karan Vance, who is black and spoke at the Birmingham demonstration, said protesting Floyd’s death was insufficient. Referencing Albert Einstein’s quote about the definition of insanity being doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same result, she said activists are “going crazy” by using the same tactics to voice anger over claims of police misconduct. “Now we have to infiltrate,” she said, referring to running for office. “We got to get in the inside because that’s where the change is. The change is going to happen from the inside. Being on your keyboard is not enough.” Jordan Giddens, who spoke about Floyd’s death from the perspective of a white person, said white America cannot excuse racist behavior as being a product of its environment. “I could have been that cop with my knee on a black man’s throat because that’s how I was raised, that’s how society and my community taught me how to live,” the Cullman native said. “But also, I looked at myself and I said, ‘Is that truly who I want to be?’ Despite the fact that all my friends and family may be that way, when I look in the mirror at the end of the day, who am I looking at? Am I looking at me or am I looking at a reflection of that man with his knee on that man’s neck?” Giddens said Floyd’s death was not about a single incident but a systemic problem. ""This is not an issue of one man with his knee on a neck. This is a societal and a cultural and a systematic issue that will not change until every single person in America takes a look at themselves in the mirror and says, ‘Who the f--- am I?’ Birmingham resident Majadi Baruti said he believed the culture in police departments cannot be reformed and suggested that departments be defunded. “That money could be used to build housing for folks. That money can be used to feed folks,” he said, “but instead we’re giving these [officers] money to kill us.” Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who was videotaped pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck, and three other officers involved in Floyd’s arrest were fired on Tuesday. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and Minnesota law-enforcement authorities. Riots and looting have erupted in several American cities in response to Floyd’s death, including multiple fires set overnight in south Minneapolis.",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, 'in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can't breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor's request, but it wasn't immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard tweeted that a 'key objective' was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was 'here with the Minneapolis Fire Department' to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. A department spokesman didn't immediately respond to a phone call. Fire Chief John Fruetel told CNN that the department couldn't get to the scene for safety reasons. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. 'Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,' tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at 'every single protest' since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. 'We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,' she said. 'We just want the police officer to be held accountable.' Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,' Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. 'WHY US?' demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. 'We're burning our own neighborhood,' said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. 'This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.' No officers could be seen beyond the station. 'What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,' Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,' said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. 'They're making money off of us,' he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. 'I didn't break anything.' The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. 'If the strategy was to keep residents safe "" it failed,' City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. 'Prevent property damage "" it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. 'Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don't want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,' he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as 'awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.' Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was 'under the influence of something,' the caller said: 'Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.' Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting 'a robust criminal investigation' into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. 'There is no need to see more video,' Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. 'There no need to wait to see how 'it plays out'. There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this ... turn it in.' The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city's police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. 'I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,' Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. 'I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I'm Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.' Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. 'Not going hide behind 'not being there,'"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I'd be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.' But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a 'cheerleader' for a 'handful' of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. 'Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,' she said. 'It's nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.' Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't 'particularly moved' by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. 'We've got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd's neck,' she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments "" both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals "" addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: 'I can't breathe.' It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. 'We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.' Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD's shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are ""not delivering it on a consistent basis.' 'When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,' he said. 'We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces.'",0.0

Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge, who often speaks out when police officers are portrayed in a negative light, is among many law enforcement officers in Alabama and beyond who say they are horrified by the actions that led to Floyd’s death. In a social media post, Partridge wrote of Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, “This is not a police officer. This is not American law enforcement. This is someone who has no integrity, honor, emotion or respect.” Shelby County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Clay Hammac echoed Partridge’s sentiments. “My heart aches for the Floyd family, the entire community in Minneapolis, and our entire nation. We are all made in God’s image,” Hammac posted on Facebook. Shelby County Sheriff's Office Capt. Clay Hammac. “We just can’t speak about one thing and not another in law enforcement. You know I’m an advocate of making sure false narratives against police officers aren’t portrayed by the media or the public or certain groups,’’ Partridge told AL.com. “When you have something egregious as this, you’ve got to speak out about it.” Chauvin and three other officers involved in Floyd’s arrest were fired on Tuesday. A video taken by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he told them that he could not breathe. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and Minnesota law-enforcement authorities. Riots and looting have erupted in several American cities in response to Floyd’s death, including multiple fires set overnight in south Minneapolis. Partridge said he had this reaction when he first saw the video of Floyd’s arrest: “I was totally sick at my stomach. I really thought I was going to throw up.” “This type of behavior is not taught. When you have somebody do that to another human being after they’re restrained, now you can use the amount of force necessary to affect an arrest, but once those handcuffs go on, it stops because that subject is in custody,’’ he said. “Anything after that is uncalled for and unjustified.” The chief said normally he wouldn’t comment on the situation until an investigation is complete, but this time it’s different. “When you have that much video evidence of what happened after the individual was restrained … I can’t even find good words to describe how it makes you feel,’’ he said. “Those techniques are not taught. You do not put your knee on an individual’s neck and compress. And you certainly don’t do it the way it was done for the length of time it was done. It should never happen at all after an individual is cuffed.” “If a person is resisting and you’re having to fight him, you use the amount of force necessary,’’ he said. “From what I’ve scene of the videos where he’s handcuffed, he didn’t give them any problems after he was handcuffed.” Often the actions of a few are a black eye on many, and this case is no different. “It affects us all. Now the good police officers have to deal with the aftermath of this, as we’ve seen in several cities across the country with riots and looting,’’ he said. “You’re going to have officers injured because of this. We’re all going to have to deal with the aftermath because it’s so shocking.” “You just have to continue to do your job professionally and you have to continue to make those inroads in the community to let them know you’re here to protect and serve the community,’’ he said. “And if you can’t do that, then you’re in the wrong profession.” Here is the text of Partridge’s Facebook post in its entirety: This is not a police officer. This is not American law enforcement. This is someone who has no integrity, honor, emotion, or respect. These four people have stained every professional law enforcement officer who swore an oath to protect and defend the communities they serve. It is up to every officer, supervisor, and administrator to stand against this type of abuse of power. Each of these four officers will be prosecuted, as they should. As a police officer, I do not see color; I see human beings with thoughts, feelings and I will be the first to stand and say enough is enough to this type of rogue behavior by anyone. To see this type of brutality makes me sick and disgusted. But, I know justice will prevail in this case. We just need to allow the system to work. While Americans have the right to peacefully assemble and protest, they do not have the right to riot, loot and destroy innocent people’s property. Please know that 99.9% of American law enforcement officers do the job flawlessly every day and risk their lives doing so. We work extremely hard to make inroads into the community and build strong relationships.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. Fire larger now . Third precinct has no police presence now. Not sure where police are but protestors cheering the fire and trying to breach #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/YG8dAV0kyj — Sara Sidner (@sarasidnerCNN) May 29, 2020 The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” NAPA collapsed, firefighters trying to save that deli next door pic.twitter.com/9OImZILpes — Nick Ferraro (@NFerraroPiPress) May 29, 2020 The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

1619944573,2020-05-29 07:18:58,"Trump tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’. Twitter adds ‘glorifying violence’ warning",https://whnt.com/news/trump-tweets-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-twitter-adds-glorifying-violence-warning/,en,True,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — drawing another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric. Trump tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. Earlier Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.” It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. Trump’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis on Thursday night. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Twitter added a warning to Trump’s tweet about the Minneapolis protests, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Earlier this week, it applied fact checks to two of his tweets about mail-in ballots. Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento, California, police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. Trump has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online, and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.” Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement” but expressed outrage Wednesday, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”",0.0

(AP) "" Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest in Louisville, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so 'without hurting each other."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor's mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned Friday, Taylor's mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter "" an emergency medical technician "" devoted her life to others and the 'last thing she'd want right now is any more violence."" 'Please keep saying her name,"" her statement said. 'Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen, but safely.' Beshear, speaking on CNN, said the protest started peacefully but some people later 'turned it into something that it should not have been.' The Democratic governor also called on President Donald Trump to retract a tweet in which he threatened to 'assume control"" in Minneapolis if necessary. The president, reacting to the torching of a Minneapolis police station by protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody, warned that 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' 'During these times, we can condemn violence while also trying to listen, to understand, to know that there is deep frustration, rightfully so, in our country,"" Beshear said. 'That there has not been enough action on creating equality, of opportunity and in health care. And in a time of this COVID-19 pandemic, it's laid bare all of that."" Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn't tolerate violence or property destruction. 'We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,"" Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. 'We hear you."" But she added that police were prepared to 'take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.' Meanwhile, Louisville's mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor's death. 'To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,"" Fischer said. Fischer called for peace, saying the 'fight for justice cannot be won with guns and vandalism.' Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as 'a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" the Courier Journal reported. 'What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.' Thursday night's demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor's boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators chanting 'No justice, no peace"" marched through downtown Louisville streets. The multiracial protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn't know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. 'I'll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,"" she said. 'But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they're out there protesting, I'll be back.' The 24-year-old, white bartender said she hopes future protests remain peaceful but added: 'With what I saw last night and with the way people were acting, it really worries me.' Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck.",0.0

The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported, sharing photographs of what appeared to be smashed windows at the statehouse. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from The Associated Press weren't returned overnight. 'I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it,' Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted before 9 p.m. 'I respect peaceful protests and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.' Earlier Thursday, video showed the crowd marching down Broad Street and blocking High Street, two downtown arteries near the statehouse. As they marched, protesters engaged in a call-and-response chant: 'Say his name,"" followed by 'George Floyd.' Demonstrators also chanted, 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.' The Dispatch reported that protesters dispersed by pepper spray broke windows along South High Street and broke into the DGX store, a subsidiary of Dollar General, on the street. Photographs from the Dispatch showed a smashed storefront at the Einstein Bros. Bagels shop across the street from the statehouse.

More than 40 million Americans have filed for first-time unemployment benefits since the economy shut down for the pandemic. All together that means that nearly one in four Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since March. The hospitality industry accounted for the bulk of jobs lost in April, according to the Department of Labor. The next unemployment report covering the month of May is expected to show a jobless rate of nearly 20-percent. That’s a significant jump from April’s figure of just under 15-percent.

(@mckinley_moore via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as hundreds of protesters converged on City Hall demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot in March by police who broke down her door. Louisville Metro Police said early Friday that at least one person was in critical condition. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. “I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter. He said two of the wounded underwent surgery and five were in good condition. Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. It also came hours after the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old emergency medical technician was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. “I don’t know what is happening,” Walker told a dispatcher during the two-minute call. “Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend.” Walker can be heard on the call crying and calling Taylor’s name. He says Taylor is on the ground and that she was shot in the stomach. Federal and state officials are reviewing the police department’s internal investigation, the police chief announced his retirement and the mayor changed policies on no-knock search warrants. The officers have been placed on leave while the shooting is investigated, but have not been disciplined. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. WFPL reporter Ryan Van Velzer posted on Twitter that he saw two black men shot in front of him. He said he did not see where the bullets came from, but said police quickly found the men on the ground and started delivering first aid. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

(WIAT) — Those living in Birmingham will continue to be required wearing a face mask in public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a special called meeting Friday morning, the council unanimously approved extending its face mask ordinance through June 12. The ordinance has been in effect for several weeks and requires citizens in the city to wear face masks in public. Earlier this week, Mayor Randall Woodfin initially said he was willing to let the ordinance expire at the end of the week, but the council reconsidered it after a spike in coronavirus cases across the area. As of Friday, there were 1,715 confirmed cases of the virus in Jefferson County that had been recorded since the start of the pandemic.

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other “twin” because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd’s back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey’s order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he’s “confident justice will be served” after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd’s death were “harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.” The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr’s comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges “must be, and will be, based on the law and facts” and that the process is “proceeding quickly.” He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are “absolutely outlandish.” Selwyn Jones’ nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd’s death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden’s comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called “an open wound” on American society, for Floyd’s death. He says it’s time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, “No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.” 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of “I can’t breathe” in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. 12:45 p.m. Russia’s Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer kelt on the handcuffed black man’s neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, “This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the ‘law enforcement officers’ in the United States.” The ministry called on the U.S. to “to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests over the death of George Floyd. During news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering called for order to be restored. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in the Floyd’s death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz’s comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. 11:30 a.m. – Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd’s death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Ben Crump said during a news conference Friday that he’s asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones “brought this upon themselves.” They cited an initial report in Floyd’s case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they’ll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club’s former owner says it’s not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades. Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press that George Floyd had worked there only more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music. Santamaria says she doesn’t believe the two knew each other before their encounter Monday night when the officer was seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Santamaria says that if the officer had recognized Floyd, “He might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria sold the venue within the past two months. She says Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but didn’t like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup. She says a half dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill. ___ 10:50 a.m. Albuquerque police used a helicopter and tear gas as they retreated from a crowd of people after a confrontation that followed a protest against the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. The Albuquerque Police Department said officers responded to several shots being fired from a vehicle following a demonstration that had lasted hours. Four people were taken into custody and that’s when police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said several protesters surrounded them and became confrontational. During the confrontation, protesters waved signs and yelled at officers clad in riot gear. Gallegos said Friday the tear gas was used to allow officers to leave the area and avoid further confrontation. There were no reports of injuries from the gunshots and it wasn’t clear whether that incident was related to the protest. Gallegos also said there were no injuries from the confrontation with protesters. —— The Albuquerque item has been corrected to reflect that police did not use tear gas to disperse the crowd. 10:15 a.m. A group of about 10 protesters have gathered near a Florida town home that belongs to a white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck. The protesters gathered Friday after social media postings that listed the address of Derek Chauvin in the community of address Windermere outside Orlando. They’re carrying sings that say, “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George,” and “We see you, we hear you … we love you! #Justice for George.” The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest recorded on video by bystanders. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted from its official account that Chauvin is not at the residence and is not expected there. The office says it’s confirmed he has no plans to be in the area. —- 10 a.m. Nine people were arrested after rocks were thrown at businesses, vehicles and officers during a Southern California protest stemming from the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. The violence erupted Thursday night in Fontana as about 100 people moved up and down a thoroughfare and blocked traffic. Police say an unlawful assembly was declared and the crowd was ordered to disperse but some persisted. Elsewhere in the region, demonstrators gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters but there was no repeat of Wednesday evening’s action in which protesters blocked freeway traffic and attacked two Highway Patrol cruisers. Fontana is an inland city about 50 miles (80) kilometers east of Los Angeles. ___ 7 a.m. Thick smoke is hovering over Minneapolis after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned. The fire came during a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. The focus of many of the protests has been the 3rd Precinct station. A spokesman says police abandoned it late Thursday to protect employees.

The NAACP, 100 Black Men of Birmingham and local clergy are calling for a candlelight vigil and balloon release to pray for peace, justice, and change. Chris Anderson, a member of the 100 Black Men of Birmingham and a former Birmingham Police detective stated, “This is a time for our communities to stand together, not to fall apart.” Many gathered in Kelly Ingram Park to honor and remember the life of not only George Floyd, but countless other black men and women who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement. People of all, races, ages, and backgrounds came together Friday evening, with masks on their faces and signs in their hands demanding peace, justice, and change in light of the recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

(WIAT) — The top law enforcement official in the city of Birmingham is now weighing in on the controversy surrounding the death of George Floyd while he was being placed under arrest in Minneapolis earlier this week. On Friday, Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith shared a message on Twitter supporting Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo’s decision to fire four police officers involved in Floyd’s death. Floyd, 46, died Monday while one officer had him pinned down with his knee down on his neck during an arrest. Floyd’s death has resulted in protests across the country with many demanding justice for Floyd and that those involved be held accountable.

Smith supports the decision of Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo to discharge the four officers responsible for the death of George Floyd. pic.twitter.com/mGswjosRQr — Bhampolice (@BhamPolice) May 29, 2020 “Four officers are responsible for Floyd’s death, NOT just one,” Smith said in the statement. “It is imperative that we in law enforcement show respect and compassion to all communities we serve in order to maintain a positive partnership and cohesive community trust.” Smith, a Tuscaloosa native, is no stranger to protests. Smith was an officer in the Los Angeles Police Department when the 1992 LA Riots happened across the city over the beating of Rodney King and the acquittal of the four officers caught on tape beating him. To this day, Smith points to that time as a crucial period in his law enforcement career. “You cannot be afraid of the difficult conversations with the people who are protesting you,” Smith told Tuscaloosa magazine last year. On Thursday, a peaceful protest was held in Birmingham to call attention to the Floyd case. LATEST POSTS",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

This question always leads to a discussion of the many curious things seen on that memorable day. Gadsden had advertised a great holiday celebration and offered numerous attractions, which drew a very large crowd. Col. W.H. Denson had just finished a patriotic oration at the courthouse when the church bells began ringing a fire alarm. Broad Street was jammed with farm wagons, most of them covered, and the sidewalks were full of people. Smoke was boiling out of Charlie Hawkins’ junk house located at the southwest corner of Third and Broad streets where the American National Bank once stood. There were more drunken men roaming on Broad Street than ever before or since, and the old hand-pump fire engine had a difficult time getting through. Its volunteer crew had difficulty in lowering the suction pipe into one of the cisterns planted in the middle of the street and then in connecting the hose. By the time the crew did shower water in a thin and ineffective stream, the blaze had crossed Third Street and was pushing towards Fourth Street. The bucket brigade tried to stem the conflagration with water from the wells in the street, but in a short time the brick building of Major Herman Herzberg on Fourth Street had caught fire. Soon there was no hope of saving any part of the city’s business section. The fire ate its way to the Kyle Opera House, which stood where Hicks Shoe Store was located. The opera house was a three-story brick, however, and its east wall had no windows or doors. It was a perfect fire wall, and it stopped the fire after 21 stores and several residences had gone up in smoke. The hand-operated fire engine moved to the cistern at Fifth and Broad streets. So many drunks interfered that town marshall John Hughes drew his pistol and scattered the mob. There was very little water in that cistern, however, and Gadsden’s first fire engine proved to be a complete failure. Merchants on both sides of Broad Street piled their stocks in the middle of the street; groceries, hardware and dry goods all in one pile. Some effort was being made to have the goods hauled away, but excitement was so high that nobody kept watch, and several loaded wagons disappeared and were never again heard from. S.W. Riddle impressed a farmer and his wagon into service. The wagon was loaded and the driver was seen to turn onto Fifth Street, headed south. Riddle soon became uneasy, as the wagon had not stopped on Chestnut Street per his instructions. Riddle found a sack of smoking tobacco on Fifth Street that he was certain came from his stock. A little farther south, he found an ax handle that he identified as his own. From that point on, the wagon was traced to a frame house several miles out by smoking tobacco and ax handles that fell out onto the highway. Many people were caught looting following the fire, and the Etowah Rifles were called out for guard duty just before nightfall. The Etowah Rifles had just been mustered into the state’s national guard when the fire alarm sounded. J.H. Disque was the captain. Just as he dismissed the company, se-veral of its members started running uptown from the drill field located on Fourth Street immediately south of Bay Street. The Etowah Rifles fought the blaze while still wearing their uniforms. Before the fire was entirely extinguished, the company was ordered out by the governor to protect Gadsden. This probably was the first time that a state military company was called out for riot duty only a few hours after it had been mustered into service.",0.0
1620305214,2020-05-29 10:11:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.apr.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0
1620307889,2020-05-29 13:46:11,Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested in George Floyd's death: Updates,http://rssfeeds.montgomeryadvertiser.com/~/625487452/0/montgomery/home~Former-Minneapolis-police-officer-Derek-Chauvin-arrested-in-George-Floyds-death-Updates/,en,False,,28907,montgomeryadvertiser.com,http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance.""

Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it.

Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling.

1620347435,2020-05-29 10:11:00,"George Floyd's Arresting Officer Charged With 3rd-Degree Murder, Manslaughter",https://www.wvasfm.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling.

Governor Ainsworth comments on death of George Floyd,https://yellowhammernews.com/alabama-lt-governor-ainsworth-comments-on-death-of-george-floyd/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alabama-lt-governor-ainsworth-comments-on-death-of-george-floyd,en,False,,68352,yellowhammernews.com,http://yellowhammernews.com/#spider,"Nearly half a million dog lovers across the country have cast their votes for Küsse, one of three semifinalists for the American Humane Hero Dog prize in the Search and Rescue category. Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0

Our city should not be silent in the outpouring of support for George Floyd’s family nor the fervent demands for justice.” Floyd’s murder has rippled throughout the nation following the release of videos that directly implicate four Minnesota Police Department officers with the callous disregard for human life.

Please, man.” Chauvin was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. Birmingham, which has a despicable history surrounding racial inequality and violence, is most recognized throughout the nation for the continued shootings and bombings of blacks on Dynamite Hill, which earned Birmingham the nickname, “Bombingham.” “Bham’s history has been intrinsically tied to both protest and reconciliation,” Woodfin said. “Truth, solidarity, accountability, hope – these are the enemies of injustice.

'The cop who killed George Floyd,' Facebook and Twitter users claimed, wrongly identifying a man pictured laughing alongside President Donald Trump at a rally as former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. More fake videos and photos followed as the demonstrations turned violent the next day. Some speculated, without evidence, that Floyd's death was staged or that protesters had been paid to stir up trouble, in tweets collectively shared thousands of times. Others said a video showed a protester driving a car through a shopping complex in Minneapolis, when in fact the footage was taken during an incident at an Illinois mall last year. Since a video of an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck first surfaced, internet troublemakers and even celebrities have posted misleading or unsubstantiated claims around his death and the ensuing protests. The social media inaccuracies have created confusion around the unfolding news, tearing at the already loosely woven seams of America's racial tapestry. 'A good deal of this, if not all of this, is intentionally trying to stoke the racial flame that has been ablaze in the United States almost since slavery started 400-plus years ago,' said Lanier Holt, a communications professor at Ohio State University who studied in Minneapolis. While the falsehoods may have been unwittingly amplified by some, they have likely been planted by those preying on existing racial tensions, Holt said. 'They put out that false information to get that narrative in the minds of people who already have these ... pre-existing biases,' he said. The online misinformation so far appears to have fallen along those racial divides. The day after Floyd died, Twitter and Facebook users shared a photo of a man wearing a 'Make America White Again' red cap, claiming it was Chauvin, who was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. A version of the image was actually first posted online by a pro-Trump internet trickster who has previously duped media outlets into writing fictitious stories. Jonathan Riches confirmed to The Associated Press through messages that he was the man in the photo. Twitter later labeled rapper and actor Ice Cube's tweet with the photo as 'manipulated media.' After protests on Thursday night, the St. Paul Police Department denied rumors trending online that one of its police officers was responsible for breaking windows of an AutoZone store in neighboring Minneapolis. 'We know with precision where that officer has been and who that officer has been with,' St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders said. 'He was at work, and not at the location.' Meanwhile, others have posted old or out-of-context photos online and falsely suggested it showed the damage caused by Minnesota protesters. Hundreds of thousands viewed a short video clip circulating online that purported to show a car driving through the Mall of America, the massive shopping complex that sits in a Minneapolis suburb. 'RIP to Mall of America,' one Twitter user wrote. Fact checkers debunked the video, but as of Friday afternoon, people on Facebook and Twitter continued to say that the mall had been looted by protesters. Facebook declined to comment Friday on misinformation on their platform around Floyd's death or the protests. Divisive misinformation around Floyd's death and the resulting protests thrives online because social media users choose who they do "" or don't "" follow and are less likely to be exposed to differing viewpoints outside of their circle of pages, family and friends. 'We thought social media was going to be this great equalizer,' Holt said. 'People find networks of people who are just like them. If they don't actually have literal black friends, this reinforces all the stereotypes that were fed to them.' ___ Associated Press writers David Klepper in Rhode Island, Ali Swenson in Phoenix and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this story.",0.0

(WDHN/Tropolitan) — It started with one student before social media brought a crowd to Troy’s downtown square to protest against police brutality. Student Taylor Lolley went viral on social media after photos of him standing alone on a street corner, bearing signs saying “He could not breathe. Can you?” spread online. The protest was in response to the death of George Floyd — who died after Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin pinned the unarmed and handcuffed Floyd to ground by kneeling on his neck. Officers restrained Floyd after police say he resisted arrest in a forgery case. “Please, I can’t breathe,” Floyd told officers. Court records state that one officer, Thomas Lane, asked if they should roll Floyd on his side, but Chauvin insisted on keeping Floyd as he was, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck three minutes after he stopped moving and talking. Another officer checked his pulse and could not find one, and Floyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital later on. Chauvin now faces charges for third-degree murder and manslaughter. Following Lolley’s example, other protesters lined Troy’s downtown square with signs of their own calling for justice for Floyd and an end to discrimination to racial discrimination, especially in police brutality cases. “I’m out here to support the cause,” protester Ebony Williams said to Tropolian Editor-in-Chief Emma Daniel as she reported live from the scene. “The young man (Taylor), he was doing a very good job. I’m also out here for George Floyd. I feel as though we should all be affected by this. It doesn’t matter what race you are.” Another protester said this matter goes beyond George Floyd, naming other black Americans who are believed to be victims of deadly racial bias. “Let’s go back to Ahmaud Arbery,” Shajuana Jackson said. “Let’s go back to the other young lady that got killed, Breonna Taylor, okay? It didn’t start with him so I want to speak for everybody that lost their souls, just not only him. … I think we should come together at a time like this because we need it.” From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the protesters lined Three Notch Street while chanting “No justice, no peace” and “What’s his name? George Floyd!” Meanwhile, the sounds of cars honking filled the air in response to their “Honk for Justice” signs. (Courtesy: Christopher Wallace/Tropolitan Photographer) (Courtesy: Christopher Wallace/Tropolitan Photographer) (Courtesy: Christopher Wallace/Tropolitan Photographer) (Courtesy: Christopher Wallace/Tropolitan Photographer) (Courtesy: Christopher Wallace/Tropolitan Photographer) According to Daniel, the protesters will return to protest at the same time Saturday and possibly Sunday. As for the protest’s founder, Lolley is using the new publicity to raise funds for low-income children in Pike County. “Many people have asked me if they could buy me food or donate money or if they could help in general and I have decided that the best way to go about this is to set up this campaign and to donate 100% of the proceeds to a local organization dedicated to helping out local children,” he wrote on his GoFundMe. “If you are going to donate money donate it to your local community, not a white guy in college.” A link to the fundraiser can be found here.

(WIAT) — The top law enforcement official in the city of Birmingham is now weighing in on the controversy surrounding the death of George Floyd while he was being placed under arrest in Minneapolis earlier this week. On Friday, Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith shared a message on Twitter supporting Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo’s decision to fire four police officers involved in Floyd’s death. Floyd, 46, died Monday while one officer had him pinned down with his knee down on his neck during an arrest. Floyd’s death has resulted in protests across the country with many demanding justice for Floyd and that those involved be held accountable.

Smith was an officer in the Los Angeles Police Department when the 1992 LA Riots happened across the city over the beating of Rodney King and the acquittal of the four officers caught on tape beating him. To this day, Smith points to that time as a crucial period in his law enforcement career. “You cannot be afraid of the difficult conversations with the people who are protesting you,” Smith told Tuscaloosa magazine last year. On Thursday, a peaceful protest was held in Birmingham to call attention to the Floyd case. LATEST POSTS",0.0

Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of “I can’t breathe” in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard.

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

1620599145,2020-05-29 22:04:33,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow across the U.S.,https://whnt.com/news/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-in-cities-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

1620610736,2020-05-29 15:32:47,Alabama Lt. Governor Ainsworth comments on death of George Floyd  -  Yellowhammer News,https://yellowhammernews.com/alabama-lt-governor-ainsworth-comments-on-death-of-george-floyd/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=alabama-lt-governor-ainsworth-comments-on-death-of-george-floyd,en,False,,312802,alabama.statenews.net,http://alabama.statenews.net/,"Nearly half a million dog lovers across the country have cast their votes for Küsse, one of three semifinalists for the American Humane Hero Dog prize in the Search and Rescue category. Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0
1620623314,2020-05-29 19:56:39,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/ZZ/news/20200529/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,658918,Tuscaloosa Magazine,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/section/tuscaloosamagazine,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Protests were largely peaceful as demonstrators marched in the streets from Los Angeles to New York, but in Atlanta, demonstrators set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN’s headquarters. Protesters used barricades to break police vehicle windshields and jumped from car to car in Atlanta. Hundreds of the protesters confronted police outside CNN headquarters. They spray-painted the large, iconic CNN logo outside the building, breaking a windowed entrance. One protester climbed on top of the sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd.

Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Brackett wore a blue mask and sat with her partner and a friend. She was less concerned about the threat from the coronavirus. “We risk our lives going to the grocery store, going to get gas,” she said. “This is more important than all of that.”",0.0

Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard 'to protect people & property in Atlanta.' Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy 'immediately' to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: 'He said I can't breathe. Justice for George.' They chanted ''No justice, no peace' and 'Say his name. George Floyd.' After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting 'Quit your jobs.' At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: 'This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.' 'You are disgracing our city,' she told protesters. 'You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.' Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. 'We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?' he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. 'We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,' Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. 'Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this.' The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. 'It's my duty to be out here,' said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard.' In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. 'My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed.' Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops' graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote 'killer' on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. 'It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,' he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death 'are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.'",0.0

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.' Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife "" comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. 'Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,' Garza said. 'We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.' 'It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,' Garza added, 'and expect results, as usual.' ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. 'What are you doing? That's a school,' one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and he also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,' Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to 'stop mob violence.' 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,' the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. 'Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.' Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. 'We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,' protester Olga Hall said. 'They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,' she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. 'Do you support this violence?' they asked him. 'How are you going to protect your kids?' The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, 'Stop. This is what they want.' Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, 'We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.' While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, 'No justice and no peace.' and 'Say his name: George Floyd.' The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. 'Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.' Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were 'professionally managed.' He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: 'Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???' Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. 'I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. 'MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.' At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had 'watched every move' from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and 'couldn't have felt more safe' as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, 'but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard "" didn't know what hit them.' The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 'is probably a very good person, but he's a radical, left mayor.' He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. 'For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and 'multiple' officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters 'criminals' who committed 'acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.' Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were 'just waiting for action' and ready to unleash 'the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to 'vicious dogs' potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks 'gross' and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation. 'I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,' she said. 'I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.'

WAVE 3 reporter Kaitlin Rust was live near a line of officers when, from off camera, she can be heard saying, “I’m getting shot!” Rust initially thought she was hit by rubber bullets, then said they were pepper balls. When one of the anchors asks who the officer was aiming at, Rust replies, “At us! Directly at us!” The photographer zooms in on an officer pointing a weapon right at him and continuing to fire. “You moved exactly where they told you to go,” the other anchor says. “I don’t understand what you did wrong.” WAVE 3 reports that seven people were shot Thursday during protests over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by police in her home during a “no-knock” warrant.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that 'my administration will stop mob violence and we'll stop it cold.' Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Dubbed the Alabama Rally Against Injustice, protest organizers said Floyd’s death and those of other unarmed black men and women in police custody showed that more has to be done then just demonstrating after those incidents. Other than protesting, organizers called on participants to vote in elections and run for office themselves, contending that systemic racism is the issue, according to AL.com. On Friday, Birmingham Police Department’s Chief of Police Patrick D. Smith said in a tweet that he supports the decision of Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo to discharge the four officers responsible for the death of Floyd. “Four officers are responsible for Floyd’s death, NOT just one,” read the tweet. “ It is imperative that we in law enforcement show respect and compassion to all communities we serve in order to maintain a positive partnership and cohesive community trust. #4NOT1” Meanwhile, Jefferson County District Attorneys Danny Carr (Birmingham Division) and Lynneice Washington (Bessemer Cutoff) issued a joint statement on Friday calling the killing of Floyd “reprehensible”. “The murder of George Floyd, an unarmed, handcuffed African American male, has again highlighted the issue of police brutality in America,” they said in the statement. “These unacceptable, egregious actions must be called out and addressed if our society is to heal. “As prosecutors in Jefferson County we rely upon our relationships with law enforcement and citizens within our county to assist in efforts to promote safety and earn the community’s trust. We strive hard to work as a team to bring positive change.” “Law Enforcement Officers are an important element within our community,” the statement continues. “We must continue to support the good officers while holding the unethical, immoral officers accountable for their actions. “However, this tragedy in Minneapolis, Minnesota cannot be ignored, nor shall it be forgotten.” ——— COLUMBUS, Ohio — Protesters angry over the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody turned out for a demonstration in Columbus that began peacefully but turned violent, with windows smashed at the Ohio Statehouse and storefronts along surrounding downtown streets. The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported. Videos obtained by The Associated Press show people smashing the building’s windows. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from the AP weren’t returned overnight. ——— PHOENIX — Hundreds rallied in downtown Phoenix to demonstrate against the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody a protest that turned into a clash with police. Protesters who marched from Phoenix City Hall to the state Capitol on Thursday night into Friday morning carried signs reading, “Silence is violence” and “Being black should not be a death sentence,” The Arizona Republic reported. Around 11 p.m., Phoenix police declared an unlawful assembly around the Capitol building. Protesters refused to leave the area, news outlets reported. The newspaper reported that rocks and water bottles were thrown at police. Video from local broadcast stations shows protesters hammering on the window of a police car, and the newspaper reported at least one police car window was broken. The Arizona Department of Public Safety and Phoenix police responded by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets at the crowd. ——— PETAL, Mississippi — A Mississippi mayor whose remarks about the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody sparked outrage is resisting calls to resign, including from his own town’s board of aldermen. “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” Petal Mayor Hal Marx tweeted Tuesday, the day four Minneapolis police officers were fired. The 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday. In a follow-up tweet, the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case, saying he “didn’t see anything unreasonable”: “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified.” ——— WASHINGTON — Twitter has added a warning to one of President Donald Trump’s tweets about protests in Minneapolis, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Trump, a prolific Twitter user, has been at war with the company since earlier this week, when it for the first time applied fact checks to two of his tweets. Those were about mail-in ballots. The third tweet to be flagged came amid days of violent protests over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted about the protesters. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Twitter did not remove the tweet, saying it had determined it might be in the public interest to have it remain accessible. It does that only for tweets by elected and government officials. But the tweet was hidden so that a user looking at Trump’s timeline would have to click on the warning to see the original tweet. ——— LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as hundreds of protesters converged on City Hall demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot in March by police who broke down her door. Louisville Metro Police said early Friday that at least one person was in critical condition. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. “I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter. He said two of the wounded underwent surgery and five were in good condition. Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. ——— DENVER — Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday, blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent. Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “But I want to plead to everyone. Let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.” ——— NEW YORK — Protesters angry about the death of a black Minnesota man in police custody defied New York’s prohibition on public gatherings Thursday and staged a chaotic rally in Manhattan, where they faced off with officers enforcing social distancing rules. Scores of demonstrators, some wearing masks and some not, massed in Union Square and marched through the streets chanting “I can’t breathe” and waving signs with slogans including “Police brutality and murder must stop.” Police officers, also wearing masks to protect against the virus, lined up opposite the demonstration. Video posted on social media showed occasional skirmishes as officers pushed the crowd back. The New York Police Department said more than 30 people had been taken into custody. Video showed at least one demonstrator being clubbed and others being wrestled to the ground as some protesters shoved officers and screamed insults. The police department said one officer was struck with a garbage can and another punched. Updated at 11:20 a.m. on 5/29/2020 with comments from Birmingham Police Chief Patrick D.

1621108675,2020-05-29 20:16:28,Minneapolis cop who knelt on man’s neck charged with murder,http://www.birminghamtimes.com/2020/05/minneapolis-cop-who-knelt-on-mans-neck-charged-with-murder/,en,True,,104308,The Birmingham Times,http://www.birminghamtimes.com,"By Tim Sullivan and Amy Forliti Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The police officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that sparked protests across the United States and violence in Minneapolis. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.

Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. This marks NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission has unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits.

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year. (The Associated Press contributed to this report)",0.0
1621121456,2020-05-30 14:47:00,Minnesota To Deploy Record Guard Force To Contain Unrest Over Death Of George Floyd,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/minnesota-deploy-record-guard-force-contain-unrest-over-death-george-floyd,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard. ""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

(AP) — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely slipped into orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoon just in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the 260-foot rocket’s first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. He and his crewmate batted around a sparkly purple toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. Bridenstine pronounced it “just an amazing day.” SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the launch attempt for the second time in four days. “I’m so proud of the people at NASA, all the people that worked together, public and private. When you see a sight like that it’s incredible,” Trump said after liftoff. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement, Bridenstine said. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report.

The shooting drew broad condemnations and revived complaints alleging excessive force by Israeli security forces. On social media, some compared the shooting to police violence in the U.S. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. 'They killed him in cold blood,' Halak's mother, Rana, told Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect 'with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.' When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said members of Israel's paramilitary border police force fired at Halak's legs and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak's father, Kheiri, said police raided the family's home after the shooting. 'They found nothing,' he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. 'We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,' Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. 'Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.' On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week's killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black Minnesota man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. His death has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak's death was 'heartbreaking.' 'The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,' he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. 'A violent policeman must stay inside,' they chanted in Hebrew. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read 'Palestinian lives matter."" The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday's shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel's separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world.",0.0

He worked with the city's booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city's body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his 'I can't breathe' pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd's death. But Frey's leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd's death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city's 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn't confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, 'What's the plan here?' Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz "" like Frey, a Democrat "" criticized the 'abject failure' of the city's response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a 'very weak Radical Left Mayor' and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn't have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey's approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd's killing, refused to discuss the mayor's response except to say that Frey had been 'put in a difficult position.' He said the black community doesn't trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. 'The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,"" Reeves said. 'This is not about the mayor; it's about the police department.' The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was 'out of his depth' and ""clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.' He said abandoning the police station 'sent a powerful message' that the city was not in control. 'There needs to be another message: 'Here is the line and order will be maintained,'' said Jacobs. ""You've got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. 'He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.' Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. 'There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,' said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. 'They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.' But he believes the mayor is 'leading with his values"" and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. 'Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it's crumbled,"" Jacobs said. ___ Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.",0.0

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

That’s what James saw, watching that the recording to a police officer kneeling with his knee on the neck of a handcuffed black man — ""outright murder."" He’s seen the news of the rioting in Minneapolis. ""Rioting and violence are never the answer,"" James said. ""But Martin Luther King Jr. once said a riot is the language of the unheard.’"" James said he’s speaking only for himself, not the Gadsden Police Department that he serves. But in Floyd’s death, he said, he saw a man ""acting as a police officer, but not acting under the color of law."" That man, Derek Chauvin, and three other officers who did not intervene in the incident, were fired soon after video of the was made public. Chauvin was charged Friday with manslaughter and third-degree murder in Floyd’s death. Those other officers should be charged, too, Thomas Worthy said. ""It’s awful,"" the retired Gadsden police officer/current Gadsden City Council member said, ""and it’s not going to stop until they start arresting officers right away — not waiting."" The other three officers should be charged, too, Worthy said, calling them ""cowards"" for standing there and doing nothing. Joseph Cole of Atlanta is a frequent Gadsden visitor — he formerly lived here — as he works to recruit more blacks to the city’s police and fire departments. He watched the news coverage, as riots erupted in Minneapolis, and he found something to be encouraged by. ""It was uplifting to me. Through all the looting and the fire,"" Cole said, ""this wasn’t just a black thing."" The outrage over the incident has led people of all races to speak out, and in some cases to take to the streets. How could anyone not be outraged, trained officers James and Worthy, asked, after seeing that video? ""This was no split-second decision,"" Worthy said. According to media reports, the video showed the officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds in total. Floyd cried out that he couldn’t breathe and was seen to be nonresponsive for two minutes and 43 seconds on video. Sometimes officers say they were scared for their lives, Worthy said. The video shows that couldn’t be the case. ""He had his hands in his pockets,"" Worthy said of Chauvin. ""And that look on his face — like he just didn’t care."" Cole wondered: ’If there hadn’t been a video, what would have transpired?"" He said Floyd’s death could have been like many other incidents, where an officer’s word about what happened went unchallenged. Worthy said when police do something wrong, there is a tendency for other officers to stay quiet, not to go against a fellow officer. ""You may have to call on them for backup,"" he said. Officers want to keep the support of every officer around them. ""This has to stop,"" Worthy said. ""I don’t know how you break that cycle. ""First you’ve got to get a heart, not just for your race, but for all races,"" he said. ""You have to go into law enforcement for the right reasons — because you want to help someone, to make a difference."" He said officers have to build a rapport with their community to have their support when an officer’s actions are called into question. James, Worthy and Cole all agree that more diverse police departments would make a difference in incidents that all to often involve white officers, and end the lives of people of color. Worthy said he knew such incidents happen involving white people, ""but it’s not an epidemic, like it is with blacks."" James said he always encourages blacks, Hispanics and all races to apply for the police department. ""The only way it’s going to change is to have a more diverse department,"" he said, adding that it will take a department with more people of color — all colors — to change the system.",0.0

(WKRG) — Family and friends of Tymar Crawford on Saturday threw him a birthday caravan. Crawford, who was killed in Pensacola Police custody in July, would have turned 29 Tuesday. Cars lined up and down North C Street, ready to roll out for Crawford. It was at C Street and West Brainerd Street where Crawford was fatalty shot by former PPD officer Daniel Sieman, who was later fired for misuse of force. Outrage swept the Pensacola community when a grand jury decided not to indict Sieman criminally. The birthday caravan drove through Pensacola streets to Pensacola Village Apartments, where family and friends held a block party in his honor. A year later, they still mourn the death of Crawford and fight for justice. “We haven’t forgotten about him,” said Charles Williams, a leader with Dream Defenders, an organization fighting policy brutality. “This family has been dealing with a travesty for almost a year now. So, it’s something they’ll never forget about.” The pain Crawford’s family and friends feel is still fresh, but the death of George Floyd in Minnesota has once again put the spotlight on his death. Floyd was killed in police custody. Those who came together for Crawford on Saturday believe justice still hasn’t been served for Crawford. Activists have been fighting for policy changes, such as establishing a police accountability board at the Pensacola Police Department. “It really reminds people that it’s not too far from home,” said Haley Morrissette, a regional organizer with Dream Defenders. “With it happening to George Floyd and remembering that it happened here — more than one time actually.” Family and friends of Crawford say they won’t stop saying his name until justice is served. “As far as black people are concerned, we’re screaming out for help,” Williams said. “We’re screaming out for some type of justice.

Council President Hardin tweeted a video with Rep. Beatty saying that they are okay, and called on people on both sides of the protest to remain calm. Beatty said in an interview later Saturday that the pepper spray was “prolific.” “I don’t remember hearing anyone saying, ‘Move or we’re going to pepper spray,’” Beatty said. “Councilman Hardin got the brunt of it and he was in the middle of the sidewalk.” She added that she didn’t think the pepper spray was necessary. “I heard no warning,” she said. “Obviously if someone had said and held up a pepper spray and said, ‘I’m gonna pepper spray,’ we would have moved. Nobody wants to be pepper sprayed, trust me.” A spokesperson for Beatty told NBC4 that while the protest was underway, someone started scuffling with police. Police took that person down, which made other protesters angry. Beatty stepped in to try and calm the situation when police started spraying. Hardin and Boyce pulled Beatty out of the fray. “We understand that tensions are high. Our tensions are high as well. We are angry, and we need change. But the only way we will get change is by peaceful demonstrations,” said Hardin. “While it was peaceful, there were times where people got off the curb, into the street, said Beatty. “Too much force is not the answer this.” Beatty said Saturday’s protest was more peaceful than the protests on Friday night, when stores and businesses were damaged, saying she wanted to be there to support the organizers of Saturday’s protest. “I can tell you 95 percent of the folks were amazing,” Beatty said. She said that in the last 20 minutes she was in the area are when things began to take a turn with the arrival of police on bicycles. “Whatever happened last night, which I am totally against – breaking into buildings, marking up city hall – I am totally against that,” Beatty said. “But there was none of that today and I kept saying to the officers, ‘Do not excite them, do not excite them.’” Beatty added that a handful of protesters got off the sidewalks and into the streets, which is what prompted the police response. “Before we knew it, the bikes were going up against a young sister standing next to me,” she said. “A gentleman was knocked to the ground and then you know what happened. People start pushing and shoving. I got caught in the middle of it. Beatty said Hardin was pepper sprayed more than she was, adding Boyce was there and managed to get Beatty out of the way. Just want to let folks know that when @RepBeatty @VoteBoyce and I were down at the protest we did get sprayed with mace or pepper spray. We are all ok, and we want to encourage folks, both police and protestors, to stay calm. pic.twitter.com/RDQ1p4YDRY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Beatty said she came out to support those protesting injustice. “The message we want to have is we need to be in this together,” Beatty said. “We need to be fighting against the injustices, fighting against racism and tensions are high when you think about George Floyd, but when you are out there and you come in an antagonistic way, it only excites a riot.” She is asking protesters to stop “tearing up” the city and asking officers to stop antagonizing protesters, adding the officers were too aggressive toward excited protesters who were on the sidewalk who “may have had a toe off the sidewalk.” “I was there because I wanted the young protesters to know that in solidarity that I stand with them,” Beatty said. “You know, I’m a grandmother, I’m an elected official, but I’m a black woman first and I felt the pain. So I was there on the edge of the sidewalk when it all happened, wanting to support and feeling the need to protect this young sister. She was very vocal, but that’s freedom of speech. To push and shove and use a bicycle against her, I just think there could have been a better way.” Thanks to whoever gave me that milk. pic.twitter.com/q82XcPChaY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Hardin released the following statement Saturday night: “I’m angry and frustrated. Folks are being shot down while jogging and suffocating under the knee of injustice. Today, I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation. I also saw police going too far, and that’s unacceptable. The people have spoken, and I hear you. The time for commissions and studies is over. The time to institute real police reform is now.  “Columbus needs to establish independent investigations into police use of force, including negotiating a Civilian Review Commission into the next police contract. Columbus needs to change the use of crowd dispersal techniques, as recommended by the Matrix report. And finally, Columbus needs to quickly move forward to implement the Community Safety Advisory Commission’s recommendations and the rest of the Matrix report.” The Matrix report is a review of Columbus law enforcement conducted by a team of consultants, employees of the Division of Police, city staff and the community working together since the winter of 2018-19. Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

Hundreds gathered on the sprawling marble steps Saturday evening to honor George Floyd and protest his death after the 46-year-old man died in police custody on May 25.

Finley was on hand at two rallies and protests in Montgomery on Saturday. At the Capitol, he stood to the back of the crowd, occasionally addressing and directing police officers to speak to disruptive crowd members. Though largely peaceful, one man and woman continually attempted to disrupt the speakers from the audience. One woman, who was white, pushed forward through the crowd while attempting to shout over a young black speaker. A handful of people surrounding her used cardboard signs to block her voice and slowly walk her back out of the crowd. ""We are not here to hear your opinion,"" said the speaker. ""You're here to hear us."" Another young man told the crowd that by talking about race, he wasn't automatically calling others racist. ""I'm trying to educate you about my experience,"" he said. ""You're trying to overshadow my voice. JJay Davis, a 25-year-old Prattville resident, had less than an hour to spend at the protest before her 5 p.m. work shift began.

Montgomery Advertiser They chalked the names up on the pavement, one after the other leading up Dexter Avenue toward Alabama's gleaming Capitol building. Sandra. Philando. Michael. Ahmaud. Breonna. And last, yards away from the Capitol steps, was George. Hundreds gathered on the sprawling marble steps Saturday evening to honor George Floyd and protest his death after the 46-year-old man died in police custody on May 25. A white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, even after he became unresponsive and had no pulse. Protests in Minneapolis: Highway closures, residents urged to stay home Protesters say Floyd, who was black, is the latest fatality in a systemic pattern of police brutality that disproportionately affects black people and other communities of color. Floyd's death has sparked protests across the country decrying his treatment, including several in Montgomery on Saturday. ""I think a part of me died looking at that video of George Floyd,"" said Phyllis Harvey-Hall to the Montgomery crowd. ""It's time for a change."" Dozens gathered Saturday afternoon in front of a Montgomery police precinct before the Capitol gathering, where law enforcement blocked off traffic for the rally that lasted more than two hours. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed on Friday called Floyd's death a ""lynching"" in a virtual town hall before asking for a moment of silence for him at an afternoon press conference. ""It was something that did not and should not have happened. We must think about how we reduce and eliminate the minds and the actions that lead to those outcomes. There's no bringing George Floyd back. There's no chance to hit rewind or reset,"" Reed said.

""We have to get out in front of it and really let the community know where we stand when we have injustices like that, and again we’re gonna let the courts make that determination, but when we have a tragic situation like that the police department and myself do not condone that type of action,"" Finley said. Finley was on hand at two rallies and protests in Montgomery on Saturday. At the Capitol, he stood to the back of the crowd, occasionally addressing and directing police officers to speak to disruptive crowd members. Though largely peaceful, one man and woman continually attempted to disrupt the speakers from the audience. One woman, who was white, pushed forward through the crowd while attempting to shout over a young black speaker. A handful of people surrounding her used cardboard signs to block her voice and slowly walk her back out of the crowd. ""We are not here to hear your opinion,"" said the speaker. ""You're here to hear us."" Another young man told the crowd that by talking about race, he wasn't automatically calling others racist. ""I'm trying to educate you about my experience,"" he said.

Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, May 25. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country lurched toward another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. They have since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. — In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. — In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. Witnesses said a group followed the vehicle and forced it to stop. Police handcuffed the driver but did not release his name or say whether he would face any charges. — In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown outside the main police station. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the building. They also swarmed a police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. — In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets at demonstrators. One man used a skateboard to try to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. — In New York City, video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” At least a dozen major cities nationwide imposed overnight curfews ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Minneapolis – where thousands ignored the same order the previous night. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported injured officers, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields and trampling one protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. President Donald Trump stoked the anger, firing off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters had breached its fence they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, Cincinnati and elsewhere. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. In Atlanta, where crews worked Saturday to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard flashed the message: “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing pleas from the mayor.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles.

'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.'

But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels 'are trying to take advantage of the chaos.' John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. 'But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we've seen cells of white supremacists in the area,' he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed 'far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was 'being led by Antifa and other radical groups.' Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that 'a number of different groups are involved in these whether it's Antifa or it's others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn't normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn't elaborate. While the motives behind the violence was unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd's death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protester confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city "" and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. 'We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,' Craig told reporters. 'If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.' St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday he'd been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. 'What we are seeing right now is a group of people who are not from here,' he said. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. 'I think about third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,' said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. 'It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.' It's exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrest were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. 'The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can't rebuild then the only thing we've done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You're talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.' Trump vowed Saturday that the 'radical left criminals, thugs and others' would 'not be allowed to set communities ablaze.' 'I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,' he said.' 'Won't happen.' ___ Hennessey reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Michael R.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

Huh) CHICAGO (AP) — Several police cars were damaged, including at least one set on fire, as protests continued Saturday over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Officers struck multiple demonstrators with batons amid the protest near the Trump Tower on the city’s Near North Side, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Video sent out by another local reporter also showed police in tactical gear walking on a downtown street. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a 9 p.m curfew that runs until 6 a.m. Sunday. Lightfoot said that a peaceful protest has “devolved into criminal conduct” and police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. “We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department,” the mayor said. The crowd of thousands converged on Chicago’s Loop for Saturday’s protest march. The demonstration began at 2 p.m. and protesters began marching north about 90 minutes later, the Chicago Tribune reported. Saturday’s demonstration came after Chicago officials, following overnight clashes with protesters, asked that additional protests remain peaceful. Demonstrations are expected throughout the weekend over Floyd’s death. Chicago police Superintendent David Brown said peaceful protests that began Friday afternoon turned more confrontational as the night wore on, resulting in 108 arrests. Protesters blocked traffic along major streets, threw bottles and other objects at police vehicles and shattered the windows of downtown businesses. About a dozen squad cars were damaged and some officers suffered minor injuries, including a broken wrist. The violence in Chicago and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. 1/A dew notes on the rally I went to in Birmingham’s Kelly Ingram park and the march that followed – this was in the shadow of the 16th Street Baptist Church (bombed 9/15/63) and the Civil Rights Institute. First – that history is key. pic.twitter.com/9ikwJrUqHh — Stefan Kertesz, MD (@StefanKertesz) May 31, 2020 — In Birmingham, Demonstrators flocked to Kelly Ingram Park, which sits across the street from the Birmingham Civil Rights Museum and the 16th Street Baptist Church, to protest the death of Floyd. The group, Alabama Rally Against Injustice, said it organized the event in solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. Several demonstrators moved to Hoover City Hall later in the day on Saturday with reports of multiple people arrested, according to WBHM 90.3, — In Washington, growing crowds outside the White House chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the residence’s lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. — In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. Police handcuffed the driver but did not release his name or say whether he would face charges. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they made arrests and cleared streets. Another video showed two NYPD cruisers driving into protesters who were pushing a barricade against a police car and pelting it with objects, knocking several to the ground. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Trump tweeted Saturday night that the Guard “should have been used 2 days ago & there would not have been damage & Police Headquarters would not have been taken over & ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games!” Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night.

Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media.Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death.

'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard.

"" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate.

The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence.

The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it.

National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew.

People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov.

The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire.

That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway.

Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House.

Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

While riots are breaking out in cities across this land following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota last week, more than 200 people gathered at the courthouse square in downtown Opelika Saturday afternoon to participate in a peaceful protest. Organizer, Jecorey Purifoy kicked off the event by leading the crowd in the Lord’s Prayer. Following the prayer, the group started marching around the square holding signs, chanting and repeating the names of both men and women that have been killed. When asked, Purifoy said that he felt called to organize the event. “I was tired of feeling helpless in seeing my black brothers and sisters being murdered. I just wanted to do something, anything, to support [them] make [others] aware that this is no longer acceptable and [that] their pain is our pain,” he said. “My goal was to get others to understand how we feel, and to get them to join in and support and stand with us against racism.” For one hour, the group, that continued to grow as people arrived, continued to march around the square. Several passing vehicles blew their horns as a sign of support. City of Opelika Councilwoman Tiffany Gibson-Pitts spoke on camera at the end of the event saying, “I think it is very important for people in our community to actually start events like this. The diversity here was beautiful. We have whites, latinos, black Americans, everyone was here. This is how you handle a peaceful protest. We came in peace, remained in peace and are leaving in peace. I am very, very proud.” Community members that came out to show their love and support had the following to say: “The issues are obviously still extremely salient in our country. I did not even realize how much it had impacted me until the first few laps. It was everything I could do to hold back my tears,” said Opelika resident Carter DeShazo. “Saying the names, saying ‘I can’t breathe’, and imagining what my existence might be like if I did not have the benefit of pale skin. I just really wanted to be here to show support and solidarity.” “I am out here today because seeing the footage of George Floyd being handcuffed, down on the ground with the police officer kneeling down on his neck, broke me. It really broke my heart in two. I am ready for a sense of justice. I am ready for African Americans to feel that they are safe in our own country, said event attendee Sharantasha Lourns. “But, today I have a sense of peace. To be out here, today among a diverse group of people, now that opens my heart and makes me smile. We cannot get the justice we need if we do not unite as a community. Everybody has to see that injustice to one really does mean injustice for all. If we want a better future, now is the time to unite.” The demonstration concluded the same as it started, with Purifoy leading the crowd in the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer. Afterwards, Purifoy said that he felt like the message that he wanted to convey was received. “I am George Floyd. The violence against black men in America absolutely takes my breath away and as long as I have breath in my body I will stand for what’s right until justice is served. Know justice, know peace,” Purifoy said.",0.0

Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police.The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35.Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn’t have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred.Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence.12: 45 a.m. ETDENVER — Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of “Don’t shoot” alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before.Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night.Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters “reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.”12 a.m. ETWASHINGTON D.C. — As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were “intentionally set” around the city. One was at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House.The church says every president beginning with James Madison, “until the present,” has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, “the church of presidents.”The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website.10:55 p.m. ETWASHINGTON D.C. — Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota.An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street.Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. 10:35 p.m. ETATLANTA — Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests.An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama. It's unclear who is taking part, but people were using tools and rocks to chip away at the concrete monument in Linn Park. 9:40 p.m. ETBOSTON —Boston Police were seen using pepper spray and hitting a man with a baton after officers were pelted with water bottles and other objects.Crowds had been gathered in the city throughout the day, however, the atmosphere in Boston changed dramatically after sunset.The glass door and window of a shoe store were smashed during the violence.Bricks and rocks were also thrown at police in another area, officers told WCVB.

1621415577,2020-05-31 02:59:47,Protests over police killings rage in dozens of US cities,https://www.gadsdentimes.com/ZZ/news/20200530/protests-over-police-killings-rage-in-dozens-of-us-cities?rssfeed=true,en,True,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

Now there are doctors who are offering some tips to try and do the protest ing as safely as possible. Theme nation's capital unveiling a massive black lives matter mural on the street in front of the White House. It's where the largest rally since George Floyd's death is expected to happen on Saturday. But the show of support is raising concerns about the Corona virus. We don't know what the impact of, um, these demonstrations will be on our cove it experience in D. C. That worry echoed by the director of the CDC as fears that the massive nationwide protests could cause a spike in Cove in 19 a new recommendation. We really want those individuals highly considered being evaluated and get tested. Many of the protesters have been wearing masks. That's what volunteers or giving away supplies. But social distancing has been non existent. I do think there is a potential unfortunately for this to be a seeding event, especially in major cities like Minneapolis in Washington, where the outbreak isn't under control yet. Now if you do decide to protest. Doctors recommend wearing a mask over your mouth and nose the whole time. Also, bring hand sanitizer and use it often. They also say Try to stay six feet from other people, which could be tough. And when you get back home, take off the protest close near the door and wash them immediately. Maybe even take your temperature every day and check for symptoms. We realize that people have the right to express themselves. They can still exercise that right while still reducing the risk of a possible resurgence. You also might want to wear a mask around more vulnerable friends or family members when you get back. And when it comes to testing, experts say, 3 to 7 days after you've been at the protest, it gives the virus enough time to build up in your body to be detectable on the exam. Reporting in Washington, Jared Hill Advertisement National coronavirus updates: As virus ebbs, New York loosens restrictions on houses of worship Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 109,000 people, according to Hopkins. New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.New York's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is moving faster than expected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday, allowing the state to loosen some restrictions on gatherings in houses of worship.Churches, temples, mosques and other religious buildings will be allowed to operate with 25% of their usual capacity once the region they are in reaches phase two of the state's reopening plan.“We’re going to open the valve more then we originally anticipated because the metrics are so good,"" Cuomo said.All of the state except for New York City is in phase two of loosening restrictions, or will enter it within a few days. That means larger religious gatherings can begin in most places immediately. New York City starts the first phase Monday.California-based film and TV production can resume June 12Film and television productions in California will soon be able to send their people back to work, several months after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered operations across the country and internationally. The new guidance from the California Department of Public Health states that TV, film and music productions in the state can resume on June 12, ""subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations."" The long-awaited green light came on Friday in an update that also provided updated guidance for schools, day camps and professional sports. This week, the entertainment industry's guilds and unions submitted to public health officials in New York and California a 22-page guideline document designed to establish safety protocols for producing movies and TV in the age of coronavirus.WHO calls on nations to encourage use of face masks where cases are spreadingThe World Health Organization is now calling for nations to encourage the general public to wear fabric masks in areas where there continues to be intense spread of the novel coronavirus — and for all health workers and caregivers to wear medical masks throughout their shift while in clinical areas.These updated recommendations, announced on Friday, are a shift from what WHO previously advised on masks, which was to not wear them if you are not sick or not caring for someone who is sick, in an effort to keep masks available for health workers.""In areas with widespread transmission, WHO advises medical masks for all people working in clinical areas of a health facility, not only workers dealing with patients with COVID-19,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Friday.""Second, in areas with community transmission, we advise that people aged 60 years or over, or those with underlying conditions, should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible,"" Tedros said, and third, ""WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.""Tedros added that the new guidance was updated based on evolving evidence. Fabric masks encouraged when physical distancing is difficultWHO recommends that where there is widespread transmission, limited capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and physical distancing of at least a meter can not be achieved, then governments should encourage their public to wear a fabric mask, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, told CNN.""What we are encouraging is that in situations where you have intense transmission, in situations where you can not do physical distancing, that a fabric mask should be worn — can be worn, should be worn — it's something that needs to be considered very seriously,"" Van Kerkhove said.The new guidance recommends for these fabric masks — which can be homemade — to be at least three layers: an inner layer of an absorbent material such as cotton; a middle layer that acts like a filter or barrier, such as non-woven material polypropylene; and an outer layer of a non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.Van Kerkhove said to avoid materials that may be silk, stretchy or porous.""What we are trying to do with the guidance that we're putting out is to provide some parameters on, if you're going to use a fabric mask, here are the best fabrics that you can use based on the evidence that we have,"" Van Kerkhove said, adding that other guidance, such as maintaining physical distancing and frequent hand-washing, remains important too.""We feel very strongly that masks alone are not enough and we're worried that people thinking that if they put on a mask, a homemade mask or a fabric mask, that they're fully protected against this virus and they're not,"" Van Kerkhove said. ""So we want to ensure that people still do physical distancing, people still adhere to the measures that their leaders are telling them to adhere to, and the bottom line is that anyone ill, anyone who is feeling unwell, should already be at home.""In general, more research is needed to determine how effective fabric masks are at both preventing the mask-wearer from possibly spreading COVID-19 and protecting the mask-wearer from possibly catching the disease.""The thing that needs to be understood about a mask is that it's a barrier. So it can be used both for a barrier for somebody who's wearing it. It can be used as a barrier for somebody who's looking at the person who's wearing it,"" Dr. April Baller, WHO medical officer in infectious prevention and control, told CNN.With a fabric mask, ""right now we only know that it provides a certain level of barrier, but we don't know if that's enough to prevent,"" Baller said. ""With the data that there is available right now, we know that it provides some barrier, but we don't know if it's to the extent that it can be used for prevention.""Guidance for health workers and caregiversWHO also has new guidance for all health workers and caregivers in communities where there has been a lot of COVID-19: Those who work in clinical areas should wear a medical mask throughout their shift while in clinical areas — apart from eating, drinking and changing masks when necessary after caring for a patient.""A lot of the transmission that's happened is transmission that's happening in the community and one of the concerns is that what's happening in the community can be brought into the health facility,"" Baller said. ""It is definitely strategic and it's looking at trying to address some of the transmission that could be happening and then at the same time ensuring that the health workers feel confident no matter what type of patients they're seeing within the health facility.""The updated guidance builds on previous recommendations that WHO made around caring for COVID-19 patients and wearing medical masks — including surgical masks and N95 respirators, which must be fitted to the faces of health care workers to protect them during certain procedures — along with other personal protective equipment.""The reason that we're updating the guidance is that WHO continuously looks at all available evidence on a variety of topics — including how this virus is transmitted, how different masks are used in different settings, including health care facilities and outside of health care facilities,"" Van Kerkhove said. Masks don't replace other public health measuresWearing face masks is an ""altruistic act"" and primarily a tool for ""source control"" in the community — in which the practice is more about protecting others if you are infected than protecting yourself, Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO executive director of health emergencies program, said Friday.Ryan added that wearing masks needs to happen alongside other elements such as ""case finding, cluster investigation, widespread testing, isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts.""WHO's updated guidance recommends masks be used as part of a ""comprehensive package"" to help curb the spread of COVID-19, which includes physical distancing, frequent hand washing, people who are sick self-isolating at home, suspected cases getting tested, and their contacts being traced.However, in situations when physical distancing is not possible, such as using public transportation, masks can help reduce the risk of spreading the virus, Ryan said.""Let me also emphasize, if you are sick with a fever, with a cough and are sneezing, you should not be in public, you should be seeking the care of a medical professional and seeking a COVID-19 test,"" Ryan said, adding that with a positive test result you need to be isolated and all contacts need to be traced.""We need to be very, very, very careful that masks are not seen as an alternative to the other public health measures that are so desperately needed.""W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXQ==The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0
1621475766,2020-05-31 06:57:11,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://whnt.com/news/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order.""

Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.

(Nexstar Photo/Wes Rapaport) AUSTIN — Following a string of violent protests across the state, Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for Texas on Sunday. According to a release, the state of disaster was activated because the violent protests endanger public safety and threaten property loss damage. Under this declaration, Governor Abbott has the ability to designate federal agents to serve as Texas Peace Officers. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Governor Abbott in the release. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss.” Across the nation, protests are taking place in response to the death of George Floyd from Monday’s incident in Minneapolis. In Texas, protesters have called for an end to police brutality and are seeking justice in Floyd’s case. The protests have turned violent in times. In Austin, businesses were looted and vandalized as protesters set fires to buildings, cars, and other parts of the city. In Dallas and Houston, police sprayed tear gas and shot rubber bullets after protesters blocked highways. In El Paso, police headquarters were vandalized in the wake of the movement. Additional protests were staged in areas such as Amarillo and Edinburg but were completed in a peaceful manner.

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

The event remained peaceful with Florence police assisting by blocking intersections while protestors marched. The organizer of the event, Dana Watts, said it’s important to get the message out everywhere, not just in Minnesota. “It happens in every city in every state of this country, not just in Minnesota,” Watts said. “We are tired of it and we have all races standing out here; black, white, Hispanic, and we unified together to show that we can fight this together. And no one should be afraid just because their skin is dark; that’s not our problem, that’s the racists’ problem. We were born this way.” The protest wasn’t hosted by any particular organization, just members of the community who wanted to unite and invoke change.

As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry "" about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a 'very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.' President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops 'easy targets,' two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal 'kit,' meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized 'Boogaloo' movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some 'boogaloo bois' in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. 'They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,' MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency "" when he said there were 'good people on both sides' of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. 'This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,' said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. 'That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.' There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a 'child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction.

""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes.

That's the moment I'm looking for.""The NYPD's 103rd Precinct is near where the march was held in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, so police knew about it in advance and were there.A pastor invited the officers to come into the circle of protesters to kneel with them, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd.All of the officers didn't kneel, Abraham said.Abraham said it was very nice of those officers who did kneel, but it was only a start.""I really want to be clear that that's not enough.

'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage 'really shocking to watch.' Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers appear to fire a stun gun at the woman and then pull her from the car. They then use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. The mayor said she'd delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. 'I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,' Shields said. 'And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.' Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. 'Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,' Shields said. 'When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally.' Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki, who has been working in the city for decades, joined the front line of a march in Camden on Saturday afternoon, sporting his uniform, a protective face mask and a peace sign. 'Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,"" Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Since Camden's police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It's not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. 'We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,"" Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd's death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed and items were stolen, police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media. Marchers in Flint Township, Michigan, arrived at a police station where Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson "" responding to chants of 'Walk with us! Walk with us!"" "" said, 'Come on!' and joined the protest. Police in Fargo, North Dakota, held hands with protesters while officers took a knee in Santa Cruz, California. While Sunday afternoon in New York, officers clapped on protesters, hundreds of whom stopped and took a knee with fists raised just north of the Empire State Building. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the Genesee County sheriff marched with protesters in Flint Township, not Flint.",0.0

Guard soldiers had helped enforce a 9 p.m. curfew Saturday in Atlanta, where violence has marred otherwise peaceful protests since Friday. Gov. Brian Kemp said more would be ready Sunday for demonstrations planned in Athens, Savannah and other cities. “Hopefully we don’t have to,” the Republican governor told WSB-TV late Saturday. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed an executive order Sunday extending the curfew in the city, according to text and email notifications sent to residents. It will go into effect at 9 p.m. Sunday and end at sunrise Monday. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” Kemp said. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there, like you saw tonight, to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In the downtown historic district of Savannah, a large crowd of demonstrators — white and black, many wearing masks — marched from oak-shaded Johnson Square to City Hall a block away. They chanted, “No peace, no justice!” and “I can’t breathe” while hoisting signs with slogans including “Black Lives Matter” and “Can’t Jog, Can’t Breathe, Can’t Black.” An organizer speaking over a microphone urged the crowd to stay peaceful. A corner bank had its windows boarded and photos on social media showed police in riot gear standing in a nearby parking lot. Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted a photo of National Guard troops from a Savannah unit on standby with large transport trucks. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said he planned to join the demonstration, while warning that violence and vandalism would not be tolerated. Kemp declared a state of emergency late Friday for Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta. Late Saturday, he expanded that order to include the entire state for a period extending through next weekend. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday she believed the overnight curfew and the National Guard presence helped reduce the amount of violence and property destruction in the city Saturday.",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement President Trump briefly taken to underground bunker during Friday's White House protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protesters gathered outside the White House Friday night in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker for a period of time, according to a White House official.The president was there for a little under an hour before being brought upstairs. It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

Prev Next Several hundred protesters came to Hoover City Hall and several Hoover shopping centers Saturday night to protest the death of a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis Monday after a Minneapolis police officer held his knee on the man’s neck for more than eight minutes. It was one of dozens of protests taking place across the country Saturday as people expressed outrage at what they said was another example of police brutality, especially against black people. In addition to protests in Minneapolis, other protests erupted in places such as Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, New York and Columbia, South Carolina, according to The Washington Post. Some of those at the protest in Hoover Saturday night said they had just come from a protest march and rally at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham. Initially, the Hoover protest was promoted to be at the Riverchase Galleria. Some protesters showed up outside the Von Maur department store between 7:30 and 7:45 p.m. but were told they had to leave the Galleria campus, which is private property, Hoover City Administrator Allan Rice said. That’s when a large group of 200 or so people — of various races — assembled along U.S. 31 near Hoover City Hall. Some were blocking parts of the highway and were arrested, police said. Others were directed to get off the highway, so they stood alongside the road with signs, chanting things like “No justice, no peace” and yelling at police for several hours. Others left City Hall and went to several shopping centers, including the Riverchase Galleria, the Riverchase Promenade directly across U.S. 31 from the Galleria and the Colonial Promenade Hoover shopping center on John Hawkins Parkway, Rice said. Glass doors at the Jared jewelry store were broken, and a window was busted out at the Von Maur department store. There were no reports of anything being taken from the stores. Protesters started two small fires in the parking lot of the Riverchase Promenade, one with a shopping cart, Rice said. Police officers put those fires out with fire extinguishers, he said. At one point, some protesters parked their vehicles on the side of Interstate 459 North, just north of U.S. 31, got out of their vehicles with protest signs and walked onto the interstate, Rice said. Arrest teams and tow trucks were called to the scene. Throughout the night, 20 people were arrested for various charges, mostly stemming from blocking traffic on U.S. 31, Hoover police Lt. Keith Czeskleba said. The majority of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, but some were charged with criminal trespassing and resisting arrest, Czeskleba said. One person was charged with carrying a firearm during a demonstration, he said. No injuries to any protesters or officers were reported, Czeskleba said. At one point, there were about 40 or so Hoover police officers on the scene at Hoover City Hall, keeping protesters off the road. Numerous police officers from Pelham and Vestavia Hills and Shelby County sheriff’s deputies came to assist Hoover police in keeping order. Some protesters tried to march from City Hall toward Interstate 459 and the Riverchase Galleria, but police stopped them when they reached the on-ramp to Interstate 459, saying they could not allow them on the interstate. It was unclear whether the marchers were planning to go on the interstate or toward the Galleria and other shopping centers. The majority of the crowd at City Hall began to disperse about 10:50 p.m., leaving only a handful of protesters there by 11 p.m. Daniel Whatley, 21, of Birmingham said people came out to protest Saturday night because they are outraged at police treating people — especially black people — poorly, often without repercussion. “We just want all of our voices to be heard,” Whatley said. “We just want to be seen.” Jerryin Medley, 37, of Bessemer said minorities, not just black people, seem to be targeted and treated unfairly by police and the justice system, and he’s tired of it. Saturday night, he said he was sitting in the parking lot of Riverchase Galleria, watching a TV news report on his phone and was told by police he had to leave or he would be jailed and have his car towed, he said. “I’m not doing anything violent. I’m not committing any type of crime. I’m just sitting in my car, watching Fox 6 live on my phone, just following the action,” Medley said. “I’m not out here trying to bust out windows. I’m not trying to attack no police cars or property. I’m not trying to cause any damage to anyone, so where’s the purpose of just trying to run people off, even if they are trying to have a peaceful protest?” He has seen Klansmen have peaceful protests and people with AR-15 semiautomatic rifles storm a state capitol building demanding that the economy be reopened after COVID-19 business shutdowns, “but nobody went to jail” and nobody is complaining they are violent thugs, Medley said. But when minorities do peaceful protests, “we’re labeled as violent; we’re labeled as thugs,” he said. Jacob Hieftje, a white man from Homewood, said he’s not against all police; he knows they serve and protect the public. But he was outraged to see the way Minneapolis police treated George Floyd, and he doesn’t think it’s an isolated incident. “They just don’t treat us like we are equal to them,” he said. His mother, Tosca Hieftje, also of Homewood said she doesn’t blame the police as much as the politicians around the country. “It’s a failure of leadership in our country,” she said. “I never want to see anyone killed on the street for eight minutes anymore. … We want change.” People need to unite and demand change, she said. “The more we all stay together, the better we’ll be. It’s not us against anybody.” Kerrick Jordan, who works with the Division of Youth Services for the Birmingham’s mayor’s office, said he came to Hoover Saturday night not so much to protest but to share in the pain that people are feeling, be a light in the darkness and share words of wisdom and encouragement with people who are hurting. He doesn’t think more protests are needed, he said. “I feel like the message has already been made. I just don’t feel that any protest is going to make that stronger. The world has gotten the message by now,” Jordan said. The Minneapolis police officer who put his knee on Floyd's neck was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. But Jordan said he does hope to see every police officer around the world take people’s lives into consideration. “Our life is just as important as theirs.” Rice said he was proud of the way Hoover police officers handled themselves Saturday night. “They allowed First Amendment rights to be exercised, but they didn’t allow people to block roads or destroy property,” he said.",0.0

Credit: WGCL Atlanta, GA (WGCL) — Two Atlanta police officers who tased and pulled two Atlanta University Center students from a car on Saturday night have been terminated. Three other officers were placed on desk duty pending further investigation. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms made the announcement during a press conference on Sunday. “After review of that footage, Chief Shields and I have made the determination that two of the officers involved in the incident last night will be terminated immediately. The other three officers are, right now, are on desk duty pending further determination of what, if any, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken against them,” the mayor said. Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields also spoke at the press conference, echoing the mayor’s comments. Shields started by commending the Atlanta Police Department and other law enforcement agencies on the job they’ve done thus far, acknowledging the challenges they’ve faced. “We have been handed an enormous obstacle and have by and large, done it as well as we could in the space that we’re being afforded,” Shields said. “It’s an unpleasant space to be in but that does not relieve us of our responsibilities. And we have a responsibility, when we handle any incident, to not escalate the incident and not cause further harm or injury,” she said. CBS46 cameras were rolling as Messiah Young, 22, and Teniyah Pilgrim, 20, were taken into custody after 9 p.m. Saturday night. Young is a student at Morehouse College, and Pilgrim attends Spelman College. The couple was leaving the protest at Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park in their car at the time. The video shows police smashing the driver’s side window, opening the passenger side door, and tasing the couple before pulling them from the vehicle. It is unclear what led to the arrests. Pilgrim was detained and later released at the scene without charges. Young was taken to Grady hospital and released Sunday morning. He was initially charged with fleeing the scene and driving with an expired license, but those charges were later dropped. Morehouse College released this statement on Sunday: “Morehouse College respects and supports the right of peaceful protest, and we expect that our students will be protected as they exercise that right. While we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation, we echo the call for justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.”",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday.

The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” George Floyd protests:Records dispute claims that most people arrested came from outside Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection.

At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. Peaceful marches, burning cars:Protests for George Floyd take varying turns “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation.

We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse.

A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015.

(AP) — Twenty people were arrested at a weekend protest near Hoover City Hall while demonstrating against the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, police said Sunday. Most of Saturday’s arrests resulted in disorderly conduct charges after protesters blocked traffic on Montgomery Highway, Hoover police Lt. Keith Czeskleba told WBRC-TV. Other charges included criminal trespass and resisting arrest, and one person was charged with carrying a firearm during a demonstration. No protesters or officers suffered injuries, police said. Windows at a Jared Jewelry store on Galleria Circle and a Von Maur department store at the Riverchase Galleria were damaged during the protests, police said. Protests have erupted around the country in the wake of Floyd’s death on May 25. Derek Chauvin, the white police officer who worked for the Minneapolis Police Department, is charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd died after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air.

Several groups of demonstrators came together in an effort to tear down the park’s Confederate monument. Birmingham TV news stations livestreamed the protesters using crowbars, ropes, and a truck in an attempt to bring down the monument. Another statue and a plaque were removed from another part of the park. During the livestream from WBRC, the photographer was told to put his camera down. “Block the camera!” one woman screamed from the crowd, as she attempted to cover the lens with both hands. “Do something useful, dog!” The protester said she and others didn’t want faces on camera because they didn’t want to get arrested. Reporters from several stations stayed on the scene but said they were trying to keep a safe distance. Birmingham Police were on the scene earlier in the night, according to an al.com reporter, but it is unclear if police remained in the area. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin showed up to the park at 9 p.m. asking protesters to stand down. He then said he would work to have the monument removed by Tuesday. The Alabama Supreme Court in November ruled that the city of Birmingham cannot remove or alter the monument. The court reversed a circuit judge’s ruling that declared Alabama’s law protecting Confederate monuments an unconstitutional violation of the free speech rights of local communities. Justices directed the judge to instead enter an order declaring that Birmingham violated the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, and to fine the city $25,000. Alabama sued Birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on the statue honoring Confederate veterans. The demonstration at Linn Park is part of a nationwide movement following George Floyd’s death on Monday, May 18. Protesters also took to the streets in Hoover Saturday and Sunday nights.",0.0

1621889160,2020-05-31 20:54:59,Unrest demonstrates Biden's challenge in breaking through,https://www.gadsdentimes.com/ZZ/news/20200531/unrest-demonstrates-bidens-challenge-in-breaking-through?rssfeed=true,en,True,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" President Donald Trump spent much of Sunday using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge 'law and order' and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. 'He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,' said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. 'America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it.' Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. There are some signs that Biden is looking to take on a more active role. On Sunday, his campaign released a photo of him visiting the site of protests in Wilmington. Biden, wearing a mask to protect from COVID-19, knelt down to talk to a man and a young child. 'The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,' Biden wrote in a message attached to the photo. 'And as President, I will help lead this conversation "" and more importantly, I will listen.' On Monday, Biden plans to venture out again to meet with community leaders in Wilmington. Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. 'What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,' she said. 'We're going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.' Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his 'Plan for Black America,' an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.'",0.0

""I think it went as well as could be expected,"" Gadsden Police Chief Lamar Jaggears said, especially when compared to what happened in Birmingham Sunday night. More than 100 people gathered Sunday afternoon to march in support of justice for Floyd, and for others they feel have been denied it across the United States. More people — who perhaps weren’t up to the march — parked at the Etowah County Courthouse and at Gadsden City Hall to support those who were. Organizers of the march and of a gathering at the Gadsden Mall parking strove to ensure there would be no problems. ""This is not a riot,"" Stephanie Marie, who preferred not to give her last name, said before the march began. Marchers gathered at the business owned by Jerome Gunn and Jasmine Wilson in the 2400 block of West Meighan Boulevard. Stephanie Marie worked with Gunn to organize the march. ""Our goal is peace, to keep everyone calm,"" she said, while making a stand against injustice, racism and police brutality. Just before marchers headed out, Gadsden Police Lt. Josh Russell and Sgt. Dusty Ford bought cases of bottled water for marchers, spoke briefly with some of those gathered and exchanged hugs with some. Freedom Church Pastor Bruce Word opened the march with prayer, as he did at another gathering for prayer later in the evening. Jamie Winborn spoke to marchers before they stepped off. ""Together we can make a difference,"" he said. ""We are all in this together."" Before the march, Winborn said those participating just wanted to get together to act in the name of justice. While he didn’t want to criticize President Donald Trump, Winborn said the president is not setting a good example, with words such as ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Jaggears said he didn’t know what to expect from the march, given what’s gone on in the rest of the country. He said some people involved were from out of town: ""We didn’t know them and they didn’t know us."" ""You try to prepare as best you can,"" Jaggears said. ""Of course you never have enough people if a crowd turns violent."" The chief said he was out riding around to check on things for some time Sunday night, and was there when some Gadsden officers were talking to someone from out of town involved in the march. He said participants seemed to have enjoyed coming together, despite the event that spurred it. ""As far as I know, there were no reports of anything happening,"" Jaggears said, or any problems related to either gathering. The march got underway at about 5:30 p.m. The marchers made their way to Forrest Avenue, past the Etowah County Detention Center, where several deputies stood outside, watching as they passed. A Gadsden police vehicle trailed the marchers as they continued their march to City Hall. They continued down Broad Street to Gadsden City Hall, where speakers addressed the marchers from the gazebo. ""Thank you for exercising your First Amendment right,"" Steven Smith told them, and for doing so without any negative incidents. He thanked Atomic Johnny’s -- as the march passed the restaurant on Broad Street, employees came out with bottles of water. He expressed appreciation, too, for the white people who took part in the march. A number of people spoke at the gazebo; after 8 p.m. marchers could be heard heading back down Broad Street, shouting ""Say his name — George Floyd."" ""This is not just about a race issue,"" Stephanie Marie said, ""it’s a justice issue."" Stephanie Marie is white, but her daughter is mixed race, and she said the girl has encountered racism at school. She said since the effort to organize the march began, they have received threats on social media. ""They threatened to run us over, to spray us with fire hoses,"" she said, and worse. But there was no evidence of that as the march got underway. For about an hour people gathered — a racially mixed group of people — many bearing signs: ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""I Can’t Breathe,"" ""If you’re neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor,"" ""Stop killing us,"" ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable — JFK"" and ""Justice for George Floyd."" A prayer vigil was held later in the evening in the parking lot of the Gadsden Mall, and some of those who had marched made their way over to the event. Around 60 people attended, and Word also opened that event with a few words and a prayer. Those in attendance also were given the opportunity to speak.",0.0

Chief Lawrence Battiste said, “Listen! If you want an answer, you’ve got to listen. You have to be willing to listen. It’s not what you saw and what you know, it’s what you can prove, and can you prove that it was the intent of that officer to…” Protesters cut off Chief Battiste from speaking and said, “He was smiling bro. You know you’ve seen him smiling.” When speaking to a crowd, Mayor Sandy Stimpson said, “It’s impossible for anybody to know anything and if you think that’s going to happen, you have an unrealistic expectation.” A protester responded and said, “I don’t believe nothing is impossible. The mayor replied and said, “I suggest that you can run for office then.” Shortly after, Mayor Stimpson made a quick exit as he was followed by a crowd while his car sped away. Chief Battiste stayed out a little longer answering questions about his department’s integrity. He said, “I’m going to take these stars off my collar one day and when I take these stars off my collar, people will recognize me for the person that I am, not necessairly just because the stars that I had on my collar.” Chief Battiste encouraged all protesters to go home as night fell and said they could march again on another day if needed.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a 'sacred space.' Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. 'I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,' he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

1621971525,2020-06-02 01:01:26,"Protests, looting continue, lead to more California curfews",https://www.gadsdentimes.com/ZZ/news/20200531/protests-looting-continue-lead-to-more-california-curfews?rssfeed=true,en,True,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP) "" Armed National Guard soldiers lined the steps of Los Angeles City Hall and cities across California declared curfews Sunday to head off more violence after unruly demonstrators at earlier protests burned police cars, broke into stores and skirmished with officers. In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen looting in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California's orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. 'To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,' Calderon said. ""We're all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we're paying the consequences.' Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying 'End All Violence' tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn't attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting 'George Floyd,' 'Black Lives Matter.' 'We're here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. 'This was not a political protest,' Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. 'It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some 'individual failures.' Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco's popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. 'I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. 'I think people are hurting and they're angry and they're trying to be heard because there's no other way to get anyone's attention,' Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Seattle, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had devolved into another night of violence with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody on Monday. Video shows a Minneapolis police officer with his knee on Floyd's neck shortly before his death. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitractor-trailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown which had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed on westbound Interstate Highway 35. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest appeared peaceful. Protesters, many of whom jumped on top of the truck, managed to stop the vehicle. Some dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" Tensions flare in the Nation's Capital Protests continued in Washington, D.C., with marches from a historically black university to a park just across from the White House. The peaceful marchers had a city police escort as they walked the nearly two miles from Howard University to Lafayette Square. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd, and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read one sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" Betts said while marching. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" The demonstration in Lafayette Park turned violent by evening, as protesters threw bottles at police, set fires to cars and to the basement of St. John's Church. The historic church has been attended by every president since James Madison. Police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser established a city-wide curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. This is a breaking news story. This post will be updated. ",0.0

One speaker in Birmingham called for crowds to bring down a Confederate memorial in a city park. And a window was smashed out of a police cruiser during a confrontation with Mobile police as demonstrators tried to block Interstate 10. Marches and rallies were also held Sunday in Auburn, Gadsden, and in Hoover where more demonstrators were arrested Sunday. A march including at least a few hundred protesters made its way through Birmingham about 1:30 p.m. Sunday and many protesters ended up in front of the Birmingham Police Headquarters on First Avenue North. The crowd had signs and shouted things including “No Justice, No Peace,” “I can’t breathe” and “Hoover killed EJ,” referring to the shooting death of E.J. Bradford by a Hoover police officer at the Galleria Mall in Hoover in November 2018. Protestors block First Avenue North in front of the Birmingham Police Station. Posted by al.com on Sunday, May 31, 2020 Birmingham The City of Birmingham and Birmingham Civil Rights Institute hosted a rally for peace and justice at Kelly Ingram Park Sunday afternoon. The event began at 4 p.m. Speakers included ministers, activists, Sen. Doug Jones and Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. The rally was called to observe and pay tribute to the life of Floyd and victims of police brutality. The rally also had the purpose to provide opportunities for individuals to register to vote and get counted for the Census. One of the speakers, comedian Jermaine “FunnyMaine” Johnson, called for demonstrators to tear down the confederate monument in Linn Park during the rally. The city has been in a legal fight with state officials to have the monument torn down. “We’ve got a lot cities around the country. They’re tearing down Target. They’re tearing down city hall. We can’t do that. We gotta protect our city. We can’t tear down 16th Street Baptist Church. We can’t tear down the civil rights museum. We can’t tear down Carver. We can’t tear down A.G. Gaston Plaza. But what I’m not telling you to do is walk to Linn Park. I’m not telling to walk to Linn Park after this rally. I’m not telling you to tear something down in Linn Park. I’m not telling you that I’m going to be over there after this rally,"" Johnson said. “While the whole world is on national TV tearing something down, we need to tear something down tonight. They need to see Birmingham, the home of the civil rights movement tear some s..t down tonight."" Leaders from the city of Birmingham and Sen. Doug Jones speak at a rally in Kelly Ingram park. Posted by al.com on Sunday, May 31, 2020 Other speakers called for peaceful protest and condemned destroying property, including Gwendolyn Webb, a member of the BCRI board and footsoldier who marched in the 1960s when she was a girl. “When they were mistreating us, we didn’t burn down one store,” she said. U.S. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) discussed the progress made since the first civil rights marches in Birmingham, noting the diversity of the crowd present at Kelly Ingram Park. “If you would have looked around you in this crowd 57 years ago, you would not have seen the diversity in this crowd. The only white faces that you saw would be those police officers and firemen. But look around the crowd today. Yes, we have come a long way but we got a long way to go,"" Jones said. Jones also commented on the racial disparities in those who have been infected with and died from COVID-19. “They all (disparities) seem to shine like like the sun and beating down on a magnifying glass, and that that dry leaf, but low it starts to smolder, and it starts to burn. And that’s what we have seen in the last six days since George Floyd, was killed. We see the smoldering racism. We see the voices that are not being heard voices that are crying out for the same opportunities for everyone in America. But voices that are going unanswered. We face challenges folks dangers and fears that are not simply days old, but have existed for centuries,” Jones said. In Woodfin’s closing remarks, he also called for nonviolent protests. “This is not the time for lawlessness,” Woodfin said. George Floyd killing protests: Latest photos, video Mobile Police window Mobile - Lawrence Specker/AL.com In Mobile, the first of two planned events started at about 3 p.m. in downtown’s Mardi Gras Park. A crowd of several hundred people, a roughly even mix of black and white, that had gathered by that point listened to remarks by Dr. Yvonne Mitchell, who described herself as one of the organizers of the event. “It’s not just about Mr. Floyd,” she said. “It’s about all the Mr. Floyds.” With frequent chants of “I Can’t Breathe” and “No Justice No Peace,” the crowd began a march just after 3 p.m. on a route that took it along Government Street past Government Plaza, north to Dauphin Street at Cathedral Square, then along Dauphin Street past Bienville Square to Royal Street and back to its starting point. As it moved up Dauphin Street, Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste could be seen walking in advance of the throng. By that point, the crowd had grown dramatically from the group of several hundred that had started. “There’s thousands of people here,” said Battiste, watching the procession pass Bienville Square. Battiste, like other officers visible, was wearing regular uniforms rather than tactical gear. “Certainly our intent is not to agitate and to create a bigger problem,” he said of the department’s approach. He said the event had gone smoothly so far. “It’s very emotional,” he said of the crowd. “People have a right to express their emotions. As long as they’re peaceful, we’ll do everything we can do to support their right to do it.” Protesters in Mobile also tried to block traffic along westbound Interstate 10. Police initially blocked a ramp with vehicles, then a busload of officers in tactical gear arrived to solidify the line. The window of a police cruiser was broken out during a confrontation. The crowd backed away as police donned gas masks in preparation for launching tear gas. A couple of tear gas canisters were fired but not into the crowd. Mobile’s Executive Director of Public Safety James Barber spoke with people at the front of the crowd. Auburn A large crowd also gathered at Toomer’s Corner in Auburn on Sunday. Catoria Sharp, a junior at Auburn, and her friends were among those dancing on the corners. “I knew that Auburn is a place that I want to be because they have this family vibe, but I didn’t expect this big of a support,” Sharp said. “It means that people really care about black lives and they want to see a change. And I want to see a change as well.” Crowds filled all four corners of the intersection of Magnolia and South College Street before they converged in the center of Toomer’s Corner to meet in prayer. Black, white, Asian and Hispanic voices lifted in the “Our Father” as part of a Black Lives Matter protest that was in response to the death of George Floyd. The moment was both “breathtaking and overwhelming” to Chris Wyckoff, who traveled from Montgomery to join the protest. He had missed the Saturday protest in his hometown and wanted to make sure his voice was heard. Arriving in Auburn on Sunday morning, Wyckoff was a little uneasy and didn’t know what to expect. He had never been to a protest before, had never spoken out in such a way, but he felt it was time. “I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to let my voice be heard,” Wyckoff said. “My great grandparents marched with Dr. King. I’ve never been in times like they have but just getting a glimpse of what it’s like to walk in their shoes, the legacy of it.” As a Cadillac with two young black men holding signs pulled into the intersection and stopped, people converged, filling the street. After chanting and dancing for a few minutes, people returned to their corners while one man, Kristopher Davis stayed in the intersection “directing traffic” while throwing in a few flips and splits. Davis, a fireman in Opelika, said he wanted to come out in a safe, peaceful manner but still get his point across. “Me being a community provider, protector, me being a firefighter, I can honestly say not all firefighters are bad people,” Davis said. “Not all cops are bad people. But you do have certain ones… The important thing about this protest is just to let us know that we’re fed up with racism in general, but especially with black people.” He also said he appreciated how the Auburn police aided the protest by blocking off streets for them. With the pandemic happening, Davis didn’t expect such a turnout, but he said it meant a lot to see people of all races coming together. He got up towards the end of the protest to thank the white protestors who came out. Protesters will gather again at 2 p.m. next Sunday for a march organized by different Auburn University organizations. Protests on Sunday follow ones held the day before in Huntsville, Montgomery, Birmingham and Hoover. They are part of protests that have spread across the country in the days since George Floyd died while handcuffed after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes in an incident that was captured on video. Video of the incident sparked outrage across the country. The protests, which have resulted in violence in larger cities, have so far been primarily peaceful so far in Hoover Alabama remained peaceful so far except for 20 arrests in Hoover protests on Saturday night. Most of the arrests were made after protesters tried to block traffic on U.S. 31. Hoover police also reported damage to two businesses at the Riverchase Galleria Mall on Saturday night. As of 5 p.m. Sunday dozens of protesters were already gathering by the Hoover Municipal Complex off U.S. 31 for another round of protests. Several dozen police vehicles from various law enforcement agencies and officers in tactical gear were on the scene. Hoover police reported that as of 6 p.m. Sunday more arrests had been made but no more property damage had been reported. Gadsden A protest was also being held in Gadsden late Sunday afternoon. More than 100 people marched, making a four-mile circuit past the Etowah County Detention Center to City Hall. The event was peaceful, and organizers said they were surprised by the size and diversity of the group. Gadsden police gave participants bottled water, and so did merchants along the way. The group paused at the Detention Center with deputies looking on and inmates inside banging on bars and windows in support. One of the organizers, Stephanie Marie, 28, said she was more than pleased by participation and the outcome. “I want to cry,” she said. “It speaks a lot to our community the number of people, and every number makes a difference.” Steve Smith, pastor of New Destiny Christian Church, said he didn’t even know about the event until today. “To see this many young people is something,” he said. “They’re usually the hardest to reach. We had a good turnout, with no looting, no burglaries. It makes you feel good about the city. We just want unity here.” AL.com reporters Trish Crain, Giana Han, Lawrence Specker, Chris Harress and Ivana Hrynkiw contributed to this story. This story will be updated",0.0

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

(AP) "" Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. 'Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.' ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

1622118175,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622143599,2020-06-01 01:30:00,Violence Escalates As Protests Over George Floyd Death Continue,https://www.apr.org/post/violence-escalates-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated 2:25 p.m. ET Protesters staged large-scale demonstrations across the country on Sunday, expressing outrage at the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and, more broadly, anger at police brutality. Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, westbound on Interstate 35. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.""

""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

1622143594,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.apr.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' "" — Trump, on July 28, 2017, speaking to law enforcement officers in Long Island, N.Y. : 5/31/20 A previous version of this story misspelled Freddie Gray's first name as Freddy.",0.0

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Now there are doctors who are offering some tips to try and do the protest ing as safely as possible. Theme nation's capital unveiling a massive black lives matter mural on the street in front of the White House. It's where the largest rally since George Floyd's death is expected to happen on Saturday. But the show of support is raising concerns about the Corona virus. We don't know what the impact of, um, these demonstrations will be on our cove it experience in D. C. That worry echoed by the director of the CDC as fears that the massive nationwide protests could cause a spike in Cove in 19 a new recommendation. We really want those individuals highly considered being evaluated and get tested. Many of the protesters have been wearing masks. That's what volunteers or giving away supplies. But social distancing has been non existent. I do think there is a potential unfortunately for this to be a seeding event, especially in major cities like Minneapolis in Washington, where the outbreak isn't under control yet. Now if you do decide to protest. Doctors recommend wearing a mask over your mouth and nose the whole time. Also, bring hand sanitizer and use it often. They also say Try to stay six feet from other people, which could be tough. And when you get back home, take off the protest close near the door and wash them immediately. Maybe even take your temperature every day and check for symptoms. We realize that people have the right to express themselves. They can still exercise that right while still reducing the risk of a possible resurgence. You also might want to wear a mask around more vulnerable friends or family members when you get back. And when it comes to testing, experts say, 3 to 7 days after you've been at the protest, it gives the virus enough time to build up in your body to be detectable on the exam. Reporting in Washington, Jared Hill Advertisement National coronavirus updates: As virus ebbs, New York loosens restrictions on houses of worship Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 109,000 people, according to Hopkins. New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.New York's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is moving faster than expected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday, allowing the state to loosen some restrictions on gatherings in houses of worship.Churches, temples, mosques and other religious buildings will be allowed to operate with 25% of their usual capacity once the region they are in reaches phase two of the state's reopening plan.“We’re going to open the valve more then we originally anticipated because the metrics are so good,"" Cuomo said.All of the state except for New York City is in phase two of loosening restrictions, or will enter it within a few days. That means larger religious gatherings can begin in most places immediately. New York City starts the first phase Monday.California-based film and TV production can resume June 12Film and television productions in California will soon be able to send their people back to work, several months after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered operations across the country and internationally. The new guidance from the California Department of Public Health states that TV, film and music productions in the state can resume on June 12, ""subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations."" The long-awaited green light came on Friday in an update that also provided updated guidance for schools, day camps and professional sports. This week, the entertainment industry's guilds and unions submitted to public health officials in New York and California a 22-page guideline document designed to establish safety protocols for producing movies and TV in the age of coronavirus.WHO calls on nations to encourage use of face masks where cases are spreadingThe World Health Organization is now calling for nations to encourage the general public to wear fabric masks in areas where there continues to be intense spread of the novel coronavirus — and for all health workers and caregivers to wear medical masks throughout their shift while in clinical areas.These updated recommendations, announced on Friday, are a shift from what WHO previously advised on masks, which was to not wear them if you are not sick or not caring for someone who is sick, in an effort to keep masks available for health workers.""In areas with widespread transmission, WHO advises medical masks for all people working in clinical areas of a health facility, not only workers dealing with patients with COVID-19,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva on Friday.""Second, in areas with community transmission, we advise that people aged 60 years or over, or those with underlying conditions, should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible,"" Tedros said, and third, ""WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.""Tedros added that the new guidance was updated based on evolving evidence. Fabric masks encouraged when physical distancing is difficultWHO recommends that where there is widespread transmission, limited capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and physical distancing of at least a meter can not be achieved, then governments should encourage their public to wear a fabric mask, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, told CNN.""What we are encouraging is that in situations where you have intense transmission, in situations where you can not do physical distancing, that a fabric mask should be worn — can be worn, should be worn — it's something that needs to be considered very seriously,"" Van Kerkhove said.The new guidance recommends for these fabric masks — which can be homemade — to be at least three layers: an inner layer of an absorbent material such as cotton; a middle layer that acts like a filter or barrier, such as non-woven material polypropylene; and an outer layer of a non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.Van Kerkhove said to avoid materials that may be silk, stretchy or porous.""What we are trying to do with the guidance that we're putting out is to provide some parameters on, if you're going to use a fabric mask, here are the best fabrics that you can use based on the evidence that we have,"" Van Kerkhove said, adding that other guidance, such as maintaining physical distancing and frequent hand-washing, remains important too.""We feel very strongly that masks alone are not enough and we're worried that people thinking that if they put on a mask, a homemade mask or a fabric mask, that they're fully protected against this virus and they're not,"" Van Kerkhove said. ""So we want to ensure that people still do physical distancing, people still adhere to the measures that their leaders are telling them to adhere to, and the bottom line is that anyone ill, anyone who is feeling unwell, should already be at home.""In general, more research is needed to determine how effective fabric masks are at both preventing the mask-wearer from possibly spreading COVID-19 and protecting the mask-wearer from possibly catching the disease.""The thing that needs to be understood about a mask is that it's a barrier. So it can be used both for a barrier for somebody who's wearing it. It can be used as a barrier for somebody who's looking at the person who's wearing it,"" Dr. April Baller, WHO medical officer in infectious prevention and control, told CNN.With a fabric mask, ""right now we only know that it provides a certain level of barrier, but we don't know if that's enough to prevent,"" Baller said. ""With the data that there is available right now, we know that it provides some barrier, but we don't know if it's to the extent that it can be used for prevention.""Guidance for health workers and caregiversWHO also has new guidance for all health workers and caregivers in communities where there has been a lot of COVID-19: Those who work in clinical areas should wear a medical mask throughout their shift while in clinical areas — apart from eating, drinking and changing masks when necessary after caring for a patient.""A lot of the transmission that's happened is transmission that's happening in the community and one of the concerns is that what's happening in the community can be brought into the health facility,"" Baller said. ""It is definitely strategic and it's looking at trying to address some of the transmission that could be happening and then at the same time ensuring that the health workers feel confident no matter what type of patients they're seeing within the health facility.""The updated guidance builds on previous recommendations that WHO made around caring for COVID-19 patients and wearing medical masks — including surgical masks and N95 respirators, which must be fitted to the faces of health care workers to protect them during certain procedures — along with other personal protective equipment.""The reason that we're updating the guidance is that WHO continuously looks at all available evidence on a variety of topics — including how this virus is transmitted, how different masks are used in different settings, including health care facilities and outside of health care facilities,"" Van Kerkhove said. Masks don't replace other public health measuresWearing face masks is an ""altruistic act"" and primarily a tool for ""source control"" in the community — in which the practice is more about protecting others if you are infected than protecting yourself, Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO executive director of health emergencies program, said Friday.Ryan added that wearing masks needs to happen alongside other elements such as ""case finding, cluster investigation, widespread testing, isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts.""WHO's updated guidance recommends masks be used as part of a ""comprehensive package"" to help curb the spread of COVID-19, which includes physical distancing, frequent hand washing, people who are sick self-isolating at home, suspected cases getting tested, and their contacts being traced.However, in situations when physical distancing is not possible, such as using public transportation, masks can help reduce the risk of spreading the virus, Ryan said.""Let me also emphasize, if you are sick with a fever, with a cough and are sneezing, you should not be in public, you should be seeking the care of a medical professional and seeking a COVID-19 test,"" Ryan said, adding that with a positive test result you need to be isolated and all contacts need to be traced.""We need to be very, very, very careful that masks are not seen as an alternative to the other public health measures that are so desperately needed.""W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXQ==The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0
1622161500,2020-05-31 19:59:28,Rally for racial justice draws crowd to downtown Tuscaloosa,https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20200531/rally-for-racial-justice-draws-crowd-to-downtown-tuscaloosa?rssfeed=true,en,False,,29130,tuscaloosanews.com,http://www.tuscaloosanews.com#spider,"More than 1,000 people of various ages, races and backgrounds crowded Sunday around the Federal Courthouse in downtown Tuscaloosa to decry the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. As protests across the nation over the 46-year-old’s killing in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota, fostered violence and looting, the Tuscaloosa Peaceful Racial Justice Rally lived up to its name. No one was injured as Tuscaloosa Police and protesters alike commingled throughout the event that organizers Sarah N. Cheshire and Nicole Gelb Dugat described as ""a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with protesters across the country speaking out about racial injustices in the United States."" Before the march around the courthouse that, with the crowd size, took more than three minutes for everyone to pass by, local poet Andrea L. Dobynes read a poem that spoke of the fears that a black woman has over bringing a new son into this world. She was preceded by the Rev. Hollis J. Thomas of Tuscaloosa’s Rock City Church who addressed the frustration that, oftentimes, the voices of black people aren’t heard, no matter how loudly they cry out. ""We spend years talking, but no one can hear us,"" Thomas said. ""My prayer is that, if they can’t hear me, then hopefully – prayerfully – they’ll hear us."" That’s why it was important for those like Tuscaloosa resident Jeffery Wilson, 36, to turn out to make his voice heard and presence felt as the nation reels over the latest death of a black man while in police custody. ""I’m am him. I am Mr. George … and I am anyone that gets treated with injustice,"" Wilson said. ""I wanted to make sure I was a part of history."" With Tuscaloosa Police Chief Brent Blankley handing out bottles of cold water to participants nearby, Wilson said it was inspiring to see the diversity of the crowd, noting that he believes the youth among them will be the ones to make lives better for his fellow black residents. ""We are mixed and we all stand to say we are tired and this is not how we want our America to be. This is not what we want,"" Wilson said. ""It’s not our grandparents that are here now. It’s the young people. It’s the millennials. ""They’re the people that are going to make the new laws. They’re going to be the new congressmen. They’re going to be the new mayors. This is the new generation that’s coming up today."" Hayes Dobbins, 42, came with her mother, Shirley Coager, to take part in the rally. Coager, who herself took part in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. ""This shouldn’t be happening again,"" Coager said. ""We went through this a long time ago."" But because it is, Dobbins said it was important to her to show up in support of her fellow Tuscaloosa residents. ""It was important for me to come out and show that I stand with my black brothers and sisters,"" Dobbins said. ""But I stand with everyone, because poor people really get it from the cops just as much, but it’s more predominant with black people."" Dobbins said the news of Floyd’s death moved her to tears and, for that reason, ""I just couldn’t sit at home."" ""I had to come out to show that I don’t agree with that police brutality,"" she said. ""I hope they know that we care and we’re grieving with them, and we’re against this and we don’t want it to happen anymore."" It’s that kind of spirit that also led Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox to label Floyd’s death ""a murder"" that ""has to mean something."" Maddox noted that on Monday, the day after Sunday’s rally, the state of Alabama will officially celebrate the birthdate of Jefferson Davis, who served as the lone president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. ""There are deep divides in this country,"" Maddox said. ""There are vast schisms of misunderstandings. When you have a moment like this, and potentially a rare moment in American history, that we can begin to bridge those divides, we have to seize it. ""Minnesota is many miles away from Tuscaloosa, but we can do something in every corner of this nation to begin building trust with each other so that we can begin to finally conquer the many societal ills that we see.""",0.0

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. 'Maybe they should try it on the front lines.' ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama, and Stafford from Detroit.",0.0

1622216366,2020-06-01 06:52:22,Federal officials investigating if  extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://whnt.com/news/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,,82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Viewer discretion is advised. ATLANTA (WSAV) — Atlanta’s mayor says two city police investigators have been fired and three officers are on desk duty following an arrest Saturday involving two college students. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the police used excessive force while arresting Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, students at Morehouse College and Spelman College respectively. The investigators, identified as Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter, were part of the Atlanta Police Department’s (APD) Fugitive Unit. On Saturday, they were assisting with civil disturbances in the city when the incident involving Young and Pilgrim occurred. Gardner served APD for 22 years and Streeter had been with the department since 2003. Investigator Mark Gardner (Atlanta Police Department) Investigator Ivory Streeter (Atlanta Police Department) Video of the incident, that first gained attention online and on local news, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surrounding a car being driven by the students. The officers pulled Pilgrim out of the vehicle and appeared to use a stun gun on the vehicle’s occupants. The two students did not appear to be fighting the police. Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She also said she was ordering the charges against Young be dropped. The mayor said she and APD Chief Erika Shields made the decision to fire the officers after reviewing body-camera footage. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters Sunday. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch” and apologized to the students. Saturday night, more than 150 people were arrested for various violations during the protest, according to the mayor. Shields praised other officers, many who are having knives and rocks thrown at them. One is in intensive care following a collision with an ATV. The city remains under a curfew from 9 p.m. until Monday morning. Bottoms said it may be extended.",0.0

Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

1622313682,2020-06-01 08:49:28,Federal officials investigating if  extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://www.cbs42.com/news/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,,115203,wiat.com,http://wiat.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. LATEST POSTS",0.0

Hundreds of people were at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in Bryan, Texas, including Quincy Mason Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sons. “I’m really excited about all this,” Floyd said. “Everyone is coming out and showing him love. I love this. My heart is really touched by all this.” Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Mason said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It’s going to be tough to get over this day by day.” The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area.

""Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night. ""While no state has a richer history than Alabama in terms of using peaceful protests to lead the country – and the world – to positive change, I agree with Alabama native, Congressman John Lewis, who this weekend said ‘rioting, looting and burning is not the way.’ ""Congressman Lewis marched alongside other Alabamians who would go on to become heroes of the movement.

Fred Shuttlesworth, attorney and civil rights activist Fred Gray and others – led the fight for change in a peaceful way. ""I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. After all, our great country was born out of the desire to be free and the desire for freedom has repeatedly led to making positive change for the betterment of society. ""However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated.

Through the afternoon, they waved at passers-by and walked around the park carrying signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “I Can’t Breathe,” “Respect Existence or Expect Resistance,” “Be the Change” and other slogans. As the protesters gathered, rumors circulated on social media that the people behind the demonstration were among instigators of riots that damaged 30 businesses in Nashville Saturday. In response, a group of counter protesters, some openly armed, assembled at local businesses near the park, saying they would protect those properties from any effort at violence. Cullman Police Chief Kenny Culpepper, who was on the scene throughout the afternoon, told The Tribune, “We’ve got a group of peaceful protesters here at the Depot Park, and I’ve talked to them; they’re very peaceful. I’ve explained the proper procedures, and they said that they will go through that. We’re trying to make sure that there’s no issues with anybody else, though, that might be wanting to counter protest.” The entire event remained peaceful, under the watchful eye of the Cullman Police Department, supported by officers from the Hanceville Police Department. The CPD called in its tactical team, but neither the tactical officers nor supporting personnel from Hanceville had to be deployed. The relative peace and quiet was broken only once, early in the afternoon, when protesters lined up along the edge of Second Avenue Northeast got into a shouting match with a handful of counter protesters across the street. When the counter protesters crossed the street, Cullman Police moved in. Chief Culpepper personally stood between the two sides in the street, sending the counter protesters back down to the Texaco station where they had assembled before ordering the protesters away from the street. No violence occurred during the brief incident. Cullman native Chasady Vandiver, spokesperson for the protesters, told The Tribune, “We were upset about everything that’s going on, and we thought we’d bring it to Cullman. Change needs to be brought to Cullman. I didn’t think as many people would come as they did today.” Across the street, Jonathan Bishop told The Tribune that his family owns the Texaco station facing Depot Park on Second Avenue, and said that he supported the protesters’ right to demonstrate, but that he and the others gathered there would protect their property from the kind of violence that has been seen in other cities where protests turned into riots. Gesturing toward the protesters, Bishop said, “All this is doing is bringing trouble to here; that’s all it’s doing. They said it’s peaceful; it was peaceful in Hoover last night, and then it turned into mayhem. That’s exactly what it’s done. “But what they’re doing is, they’re doing ‘Black Lives Matter.’ Where’s the sign saying white lives matter? Cops are not targeting black people like they’re saying. That’s their exact words over there a while ago: cops are targeting them. That was one cop in a uniform; that is a certain individual. It’s not the whole force, by no means. “They want to bring it here because somebody wants to get online and say, ‘Whose parents has told them never to stop in Cullman?’ because of the past. But that’s the past. I’ve got probably 40 or 50 black friends I love to death like a brother. But this is becoming stupid. See, them holding signs up like ‘Black Lives Matter’ is giving the people- the black community, which I don’t have a problem with- a chance to say ‘It’s racism, it’s racism.’ It’s not. Me, him, anybody doing anything wrong, when we resist arrest, we’re going to be thrown to the ground. I mean, it’s just the way it is. “There’s nothing wrong with protesting, but just doing ‘Black Lives Matter;’ it should be ‘All Lives Matter,’ is what it should be. Like I said, I don’t have a problem with the black community, by no means. But this is just going to bring something bad here, is what it’s going to do.” Vandiver said that the protesters have no specific plans for more demonstrations, but said,“If we’re still needing to fight, then we’re going to come out here and protest peacefully.” Copyright 2020 Humble Roots, LLC.

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0
1622401492,2020-06-01 11:33:44,Former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions issues statement in response to riots,https://www.wkrg.com/mobile-county/former-alabama-senator-jeff-sessions-issues-statement-in-response-to-riots/,en,False,,118429,wkrg.com,http://wkrg.com/,"MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — Former Alabama Senator and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a statement on the riots across Alabama. Protests have happened across the country, sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Sessions said “The last few nights have made clear that rioters and looters have twisted the memory of George Floyd and have distorted the message of justice from the peaceful protestors and have turned it into an excuse for anarchy, crime, and destruction. George Floyd deserved better.” Several were held over the weekend, one happened in Downtown Mobile. Several protesters made their way near the I-10 ramp. At one point, a bat went flying in the air — followed by water bottles and profanity-filled chants. The window of a police car was broken. Police dispersed tear gas into the crowd. Later, protesters gathered at I-65 and Airport Boulevard in Mobile. Mobile police shut down part of Airport Boulevard. Water bottles were thrown at police and tear gas was used again. A door was broken at the Lowe’s at I-65 and Beltline, police tell News 5 no one went inside the store. Shots were fired around the Walmart and Lowe’s. FULL STATEMENT: We must fully understand that these recent destructive riots are not protests, but are indeed riots, driven by anarchists, radicals, and groups that want to destroy our society, not build it up. Too many public officials haven’t understood this fact. They plead, whine, and urge the many good people of their communities to be calm and responsible, but these good people are not the ones burning, cursing, and attacking stores, buildings, and people, civilians and police. The radicals hear the pleas for what they are—weakness, and a signal that swift and violent action can succeed. They are emboldened, and call in outside allies. Violence and destruction increase and spread. The outlaws think that they have the law officers on the run. Meanwhile, the good police officers under the gun for wrongdoings of others are confused, fearful and demoralized because they doubt they have the support of their officials. This lack of clear leadership, this politically correct policing, is a total disaster. We have seen this movie before. Don’t we know how it ends? This idiocy is devastating. Much of this death and destruction would never have happened if the relevant local and state officials had stood on law and principle. Americans cannot and will not abide this violence and destruction any longer. If any government official does wrong, every American has the constitutional right to protest and demand justice, but no American is entitled to commit violence or destruction or participate in a lawless mob. The Rule of Law, not the Rule of Mobs, must prevail. It is enraging to think that at this very moment an American citizen is more likely to be arrested for attending church than for fire-bombing a church, if that person lives in a liberal city or state. All necessary resources and force must be brought to bear to restore order from the chaos and uphold justice for all. State, local, and federal law enforcement partnerships that I helped rebuild as Attorney General should be activated to identify, pursue, and apprehend dangerous rioters before they strike again. The National Guard and other federal forces should be called on when needed. We must immediately arrest those who burn, loot, and hurt to prevent the violence and destruction from continuing and spreading. The burning of the Minneapolis police station and the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, the murder of an African American federal security officer in California, the injuries to more than 60 Secret Service agents defending the White House, and the countless other assaults on law officers, National Guardsmen, first responders, business owners, and innocent bystanders are not just attacks on people and property, they are direct attacks our system of justice and our commitment to be a Nation of Laws. The last few nights have made clear that rioters and looters have twisted the memory of George Floyd and have distorted the message of justice from the peaceful protestors and have turned it into an excuse for anarchy, crime, and destruction. George Floyd deserved better. Fortunately, security cameras and the widespread use of smartphones provide us with substantial evidence that can be used to bring the rioters to justice. State, local, and federal enforcement agencies across the country should commit to using all of their investigative resources to identify and prosecute the criminals depicted in those videos and images of assaults, destruction, and looting over the past few nights. Every one of them must be brought to justice. And elected officials must commit to supporting that good work, not continuing to encourage the riots through leniency. George Floyd’s tragic death does not justify these acts of murder and mayhem. President Trump is right: these rioters are acting as terrorists and should be treated as such. We have developed great cross-jurisdictional law enforcement partnerships between our sheriffs, police, state troopers, and federal agencies. Together, we should “flood the zone” and target, remove, and vigorously prosecute these rioters and criminals as soon as unrest begins. This strategy, conducted with overwhelming and combined numbers and force, would quell these riots before they engulf whole communities and spread further. We cannot allow our police forces to be outnumbered or overrun when facing these kinds of violent hordes. Violent, destructive mobs cannot be allowed to rule our streets one minute longer. It must end now! Jeff Sessions",0.0

(AP) — Twenty people were arrested at a weekend protest near Hoover City Hall while demonstrating against the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, police said Sunday. Most of Saturday’s arrests resulted in disorderly conduct charges after protesters blocked traffic on Montgomery Highway, Hoover police Lt. Keith Czeskleba told WBRC-TV. Other charges included criminal trespass and resisting arrest, and one person was charged with carrying a firearm during a demonstration. No protesters or officers suffered injuries, police said. Windows at a Jared Jewelry store on Galleria Circle and a Von Maur department store at the Riverchase Galleria were damaged during the protests, police said. Protests have erupted around the country in the wake of Floyd’s death on May 25. Derek Chauvin, the white police officer who worked for the Minneapolis Police Department, is charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd died after Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. In addition to marking Floyd’s death, protesters in Hoover told the television station they were there for Emantic “EJ” Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., who was killed on Thanksgiving night 2018 by an officer who was responding to a shooting at the Riverchase Galleria Mall. Police initially described him as the gunman in the shooting but later retracted that allegation.",0.0

Guard soldiers had helped enforce a 9 p.m. curfew Saturday in Atlanta, where violence has marred otherwise peaceful protests since Friday. Gov. Brian Kemp said more would be ready Sunday for demonstrations planned in Athens, Savannah and other cities. “Hopefully we don’t have to,” the Republican governor told WSB-TV late Saturday. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed an executive order Sunday extending the curfew in the city, according to text and email notifications sent to residents. It will go into effect at 9 p.m. Sunday and end at sunrise Monday. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” Kemp said. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there, like you saw tonight, to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In the downtown historic district of Savannah, a large crowd of demonstrators — white and black, many wearing masks — marched from oak-shaded Johnson Square to City Hall a block away. They chanted, “No peace, no justice!” and “I can’t breathe” while hoisting signs with slogans including “Black Lives Matter” and “Can’t Jog, Can’t Breathe, Can’t Black.” An organizer speaking over a microphone urged the crowd to stay peaceful. A corner bank had its windows boarded and photos on social media showed police in riot gear standing in a nearby parking lot. Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted a photo of National Guard troops from a Savannah unit on standby with large transport trucks. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said he planned to join the demonstration, while warning that violence and vandalism would not be tolerated. Kemp declared a state of emergency late Friday for Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta. Late Saturday, he expanded that order to include the entire state for a period extending through next weekend. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday she believed the overnight curfew and the National Guard presence helped reduce the amount of violence and property destruction in the city Saturday.",0.0

The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing?

Viewer discretion is advised.The latest: Protests continue in major cities like Houston, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, New York City, St. Paul, Orlando. Protests have been largely peaceful.Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. Six Atlanta police officers have been charged after a dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people from a car during protests over the death of George Floyd.The state of Minnesota filed a human rights complaint Tuesday against the Minneapolis Police Department in Floyd's death.Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power, than in principle.” NEW YORK —Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night after night.Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0
1622430836,2020-06-01 12:09:25,Woman wanted for smashing MPD cruiser window during Sunday protest,https://www.wkrg.com/mobile-county/woman-wanted-for-smashing-mpd-cruiser-window/,en,False,,118429,wkrg.com,http://wkrg.com/,"MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — Police are asking for the public’s help to identify the woman who shattered the window of a police cruiser during Sunday’s protest downtown over the death of George Floyd. News 5 cameras captured the woman using a bat to shatter the front passenger window of the vehicle. It happened as police tried to prevent the protesters from getting onto I-10. Officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. MPD says the woman is wanted for her active role of willful destruction of city property. She had a red bandana, but it was around her neck and not covering her face. News 5 crews also got a good look at the suspect at another time during the protest. Here’s a slideshow from our camera footage: The protests in Mobile were part of a growing “I Can’t Breathe” movement demanding justice for the death of Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. George Floyd, seen here in a security uniform, and Derek Chauvin once worked at the same nighthclub, El Nuevo Rodeo in Minneapolis. Derek Chauvin, the officer caught on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck, is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Protesters across the country want the other officers involved in the incident to be criminally charged as well. The vast majority of people who showed up for Sunday’s protest in Mobile were peaceful. There was also a peaceful vigil in Cathedral Square where people gathered and counted off each second that Floyd was pinned: 8 minutes and 46 seconds. MPD Chief Lawrence Battiste and Mobile Public Safety Director James Barber made themselves available throughout the protest to maintain an open dialogue with the community as people voiced their concerns.

Kia Yanna Monroe, one of the protesters, was out picking up trash along with others left behind in areas where protesters assembled. “I was here protesting on Saturday, and I just noticed that after the protest there’s a lot of garbage, a lot of bottles, a lot of stuff that’s on the ground. Just wanted to come out and clean up a little bit,” she said. “I think it’s important. I understand why everybody’s out here. I’m part of it, but I also think our city needs to be cleaned too,” she said. Monroe said it’s “just the right thing to do,” and that other people were out cleaning during the weekend. She said all the violence and looting was hard to see since the protests are supposed to be peaceful. “It was a little rough being down here cause some people are using the Black Lives Matter in a very negative way, trying to cause more commotion that it needs to be, she said. “It’s supposed to be peaceful protests, and some people turning it into making it become violent which is not the answer.” Everybody, especially police, she said, needs to sit down and talk about how to move forward. “Clearly, conversation needs to be had,” she said. “Everybody needs to listen to each other, especially the cops. They way they’re handling it now, I don’t think is the right way cause you are shooting at us, macing us. You are tear-gassing us when all we’re trying to do is peacefully protest and wanting somebody to listen to us.” Across downtown, on Congress Ave. Kelly Johnson and her daughter Daphne had the same idea. “I was very supportive of the protests, but I just didn’t like the way the city was left,” Johnson said. She runs IREP, an Austin-based junk hauling company that donates items people leave behind to those in need. She and Daphne planned to use their equipment to help haul away trash, as well. However, by the time they got downtown Monday, others like Monroe had already finished most of that work. “We realized that there was not a lot of trash to pick up, but we saw all the graffiti. And, so, we pivoted,” Johnson said. She and her daughter picked up some graffiti removal spray and spent the day scrubbing off spray paint in front of businesses. Seeing it through the eyes of her mom, who runs a small business of her own, Daphne urged people to think about who vandalism and looting is actually hurting. “I get why people are angry. They have every right to be,” Daphne said. “But when you damage things that have nothing to do with it, like who knows if these people who run this might be totally with you. Damaging their property isn’t going to make it…it just doesn’t help anything. It doesn’t prove a point. It just makes people mad.” Johnson added that’s especially true in the middle of a pandemic. “The businesses have suffered so much already, and it’s like they didn’t need this on top of it, you know?” The mother-daughter pair plans to keep working throughout the week and is inviting others to help. “Cause Daphne and I, were pretty fit, but there’s only so much we can do by ourselves,” Johnson smiled. The Johnsons say anyone who would like to help can reach out to them through their company’s contact form. “We’ll just keep working until we can get this city back to, you know, showing it off again,” Johnson said.

Ivey announced in a release on Monday that she has given authorization to Adjutant General Sheryl Gordon with the Alabama National Guard to activate up to 1,000 guardsmen, should the need arise in response to violent civil unrest. The governor’s office said that this action strictly serves as a preparedness measure, should local and state law enforcement need additional support. “While there is no immediate need for us to deploy our Guard, I have given authorization to Adjutant General Sheryl Gordon to be on standby, should our local and state law enforcement need additional support,” Ivey stated. “The Alabama National Guard stands ready to assist when peaceful protests become violent and dangerous to our public safety,” she added. “I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point.” This came shortly after former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a statement calling on Ivey to mobilize the Alabama National Guard in response to the events in Birmingham. “The surge of destruction and violence we witnessed last night in the great city of Birmingham must not be allowed to continue,” Sessions said. “All over the country we have seen the results of ‘politically correct’ and completely ineffective leadership. What began as peaceful protests has been seized and distorted by Antifa, far-left radicals, and criminal thugs who are intent only on destruction and anarchy. We must not simply withdraw or pull back and watch as rioters and terrorists destroy personal property, vandalize, burn, and commit acts of violence,” he continued. Sessions’ statement came minutes after Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin announced a curfew from 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. in the city. “A curfew is now essential,” Sessions remarked. “We cannot allow our law enforcement personnel to be outnumbered by those who seek to sow violence. Every asset must be brought to bear to support Birmingham’s government and law enforcement. The Governor should mobilize sufficient numbers of our National Guard, so that our police are supported and order is restored.” “While we fully support the constitutional right to peaceful protest, a great city must defend the rule of law, with no exceptions,” he concluded. “We must not allow criminal mobs to roam from block to block, looting and destroying as they go. This will not stop until arrests are made, lawbreakers are jailed, and cases against the criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Sessions is currently in a Republican primary runoff for the U.S. Senate seat he held before being appointed as President Donald J. Trump’s first attorney general. Sessions’ runoff opponent, former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville, also released a statement on Monday morning. “Arson, looting, rioting, vandalism, and violence are not valid forms of protest – they are felonies that must be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Tuberville said. “Looting stores and stealing televisions will not stop another death like George Floyd’s from occurring,” he added. “Beating journalists and robbing them of their wallets and telephones is not a social statement. It is simply felons being felons.” Tuberville advised, “Unless anarchy is met with the rule of law, the foundation of our nation will begin to crumble, so I support President Trump’s decision to declare Antifa a terrorist organization and his calls to use the National Guard to stop further riots.” Sean Ross is the editor of Yellowhammer News.

1622460768,2020-06-01 11:52:19,"It's time to stand up': Peaceful demonstrations, looting and chanting on sixth night of George Floyd protests",https://www.gadsdentimes.com/zz/news/20200601/its-time-to-stand-up-peaceful-demonstrations-looting-and-chanting-on-sixth-night-of-george-floyd-protests?rssfeed=true,en,False,,90007,gadsdentimes.com,http://www.gadsdentimes.com/#spider,"Protesters marched in the streets again Sunday across the U.S. to call for reforms after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Don't pretend there's not a problem in America. Don't turn your back on racism. Don't accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don't make any more excuses. Don't think this doesn't affect you.

While being arrested, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. The video shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop.

Prev Next While rioters did serious damage to buildings in downtown Birmingham and assaulted news reporters Sunday night, protests in Hoover earlier Sunday were mild in comparison. But up to 400 protesters did convene along U.S. 31 next to the Hoover Public Library for more than six hours Sunday afternoon and night. The protesters arrived at the library about 3:30 p.m. Sunday and started walking north along U.S. 31, city officials said. Hoover police did not allow them to cross Municipal Drive and made several arrests as they directed the protesters to stay off the road, City Administrator Allan Rice said. The protesters stayed at the corner of U.S. 31 and Municipal Drive until about 9:45 p.m., when they dispersed. In the beginning, there were only about 100 protesters, Rice said. But the crowd grew to about 400 protesters at its peak. There were more than 100 law enforcement officers in the immediate vicinity, including Hoover and Vestavia Hills police and Shelby County sheriff’s deputies. The Hoover Police Department’s tactical team wore military-style uniforms. Most of the officers were lined up and spread out along Municipal Drive and in a turn lane on U.S. 31 to keep the protesters out of the road. Rice said Hoover authorities want to protect people’s right to protest but will not allow unscheduled marches on roadways in the city. “That’s just incredibly hazardous,” he said. No request was made for permission to march, he said. Throughout the day Sunday, Hoover police made an estimated 25 arrests, Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector said. Rector did not have details on each one Sunday night but said most of the arrests likely were related to disorderly conduct when protesters refused to stay off the road. Others were arrested for throwing items at police, and some likely will face a resisting arrest charge as well, he said. Some protesters hurled plastic water bottles with water in them at police at various times throughout the protest, but especially as officers were making arrests. One officer had minor injuries to his face as a protester was resisting arrest and was checked out at a hospital emergency room and released, Rector said. There were no reported injuries of protesters or bystanders, he said. Throughout the afternoon and night, the protesters in Hoover chanted sayings and repeatedly cursed and taunted the law enforcement officers. Some of the chants included sayings such as “No justice, no peace,” “no racist police,” “black lives matter,” get your knee off my neck,” “I can’t breathe” and “this is what democracy looks like.” Vulgar language was plentiful. Protesters also repeatedly asked the law enforcement officers to take a knee to show solidarity for their cause, but law enforcement officers did not. Numerous people drove by the protest in vehicles, honking their horns, prompting cheers from the protesters. Austin Gibbs, a 25-year-old white protester from the Clay community in east Jefferson County, said he came to the protest because he continues to see signs of tyranny by police officers and politicians. “They’re doing the same things they’ve been doing for 150 years,” he said. “We can’t have it to be like that anymore.” They run roughshod over people of color and treat people like second-class citizens, and no one holds them accountable, Gibbs said. The wealthier people also horde money, goods and services, he said. “The people here have more than they need in Hoover and Mountain Brook,” Gibbs said. Meanwhile, people in places such as Ensley and Forestdale have a hard time keeping a grocery store open, he said. When asked what the protesters are hoping to accomplish in Hoover, Gibbs said the idea is to “ruin” Hoover’s community by making it uncomfortable for people to come to the city. Other protesters on Friday night said they’re tired of police treating minorities unfairly without repercussion, not just in Hoover, but in communities across America. The biggest trigger for the current wave of protests sweeping the country was when a white Minneapolis police officer put his knee on the neck of a 46-year-old black man for more than eight minutes as police detained him on the ground on Monday, May 25. The man, George Floyd, repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe, appeared in a video to go unconscious and later died. Four police officers who responded to the call were fired, and the officer who put his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Meanwhile, the case has sparked protests, rioting and looting in dozens of cities across the country. After a peaceful protest in Birmingham Sunday afternoon, chaos broke out in downtown Birmingham late Sunday night, with rioters smashing windows, vandalizing buildings and assaulting at least two news reporters. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin released a video on Twitter, saying people have a right to be angry and to demand better policing. However, “you don’t have the right to walk around busting windows, setting things on fire, damaging people’s property, looting, taking things that don’t belong to you,” Woodfin said. “That makes you a hijacker of a peaceful rally. That makes you a hijacker of peaceful protesters, and those types of people aren’t welcome in the city of Birmingham. “I’m appalled by what I’ve seen tonight,” Woodfin said. “I’m very angry. … None of our community deserves this. We support peaceful protests. We do not support what has happened here. It’s unacceptable. Stop destroying your own community. Stop destroying our community. We deserve better.”",0.0

He announced a curfew will be in place from 7:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. until the unrest subsides. Woodfin also committed to the promise he made to protesters Sunday night that he would take down the monument to the Confederate soldiers in Birmingham’s Linn Park. The mayor believes the cost in civil unrest outweighs the civil suit his city would be vulnerable to if violating the Alabama law protecting statues as old as the one in Linn Park. The leaders of Birmingham’s police and fire departments joined Woodfin at a press conference Monday morning. The three men detailed that Sunday night in Birmingham 24 people were arrested, 14 businesses were looted, 13 more businesses were significantly damaged, five commercial properties were lit on fire and 17 more fires sprung up in public that demanded the fire department’s attention.  Woodfin began his remarks with a remembrance of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was shown in a video dying from the actions taken by a white Minneapolis police officer who has since been charged with murder and manslaughter. “That’s shaken all of us to our core, it has hit us all, it has brought up every emotion you can think of,” Woodfin said of the much-publicized video of Floyd’s death. Woodfin then turned to the events of Sunday night. “I support activism and your right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs and people destroying things just because,” remarked Woodfin. The mayor then announced the citywide curfew, and warned anyone planning to stay on the streets, “We’re not playing.” Woodfin said that anyone loitering or gathering on the streets after 7:00 p.m. will have to deal with the city’s police department. He said that employers who require workers to be out at those hours should provide some type of documentation an officer could check. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform,” Woodfin told the public. “You’re not doing that in the name of reform or George Floyd,” Woodfin said of those turning to violence and destruction before adding, “You’re on a different agenda that the city of Birmingham will not tolerate.” The curfew currently has no end date, and Woodfin told reporters he would be assessing the continued need for a curfew on a daily basis. Birmingham’s leader urged the public to call the Crimestoppers number at 205-254-7777 and turn in those who are committing crimes. Woodfin was asked by a reporter about comments he made Sunday night promising to remove by Tuesday at noon the monument to Confederate soldiers in Birmingham’s Linn Park. “In order to prevent more civil unrest in our city, I think it is very imperative we remove this statue,” Woodfin said. “That has a cost to it. I understand that the AG’s office can bring a civil suit against the city. If there is a judgment rendered from a judge, then we should be held accountable,” continued the mayor. “I believe I am willing to accept that, because that is a lower cost than civil unrest in our city,” added Woodfin about the consequences of breaking the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act that makes it illegal to remove statues more than 40 years old. Woodfin said his city does not intend to destroy the statue or harm it in any way. “We want to bring in someone that can show us how to remove it without causing any more damage to it,” Woodfin said of the statue. He said the City of Birmingham will see if the Daughters of the Confederacy group wants to take ownership of the statue, or if it can be placed in a museum. Woodfin was also asked about those claiming local comedian Jermaine “Funnymaine” Johnson before the destruction began on Sunday evening. “We need to tear something down tonight. They need to see Birmingham, the home of the civil rights movement, tear some shit down tonight,” remarked Johnson in a clip circulated on social media. “We will be following up on any information people would like to share, about anyone that incited anything. And if in our power, we have evidence, we will bring charges,” responded Woodfin to the question about Johnson. Johnson has denied the claims of incitement and made attempts to fundraise in support of damaged black businesses in a tweet Monday morning. Woodfin said he would been talking frequently with Governor Kay Ivey’s chief of staff Jo Bonner, and as of now there are no plans to deploy the National Guard within Birmingham. Governor Ivey on Monday authorized up to 1,000 National Guard troops to be readied in case events make them necessary. Woodfin concluded his press conference on Monday with plea to all Magic City residents: “Birmingham the world is watching, we disappointed ourselves last night, let’s not make that mistake again. Do the right thing.” Henry Thornton is a staff writer for Yellowhammer News. You can contact him by email: henry@yellowhammernews.com or on Twitter @HenryThornton95",0.0

In a statement released Monday by the Huntsville police department, McMurray said he had been in contact with HPD employees, Mayor Tommy Battle’s Office and Huntsville City Council “emphasizing the intolerable and inexcusable in-custody death of George Floyd.” McMurray said the actions of the officers in the video are not how Huntsville police trains its officers. “The training we conduct reflects the role and responsibility of an officer to protect and safeguard suspects in custody as well as the public,” McMurray said. “This is paramount to what we do. We have no training that equates to the total disregard for life that was displayed in that video.” In regard to protesting in Huntsville, McMurray said the department respects citizens’ right to protest peacefully “and we will be there to support and protect you as we give voice to our human rights as citizens of this great community and nation.” McMurray’s complete statement is below: “The misconduct of a few officers several hundred miles away has once again brought national attention and doubt on the profession of law enforcement. I have spent this last week in communication with Huntsville Police Department employees, the Mayor’s Office and our City Council Members emphasizing the intolerable and inexcusable in-custody death of George Floyd. The video is heart-wrenching and angers police leaders across the country. HPD extends our deepest condolences to the Floyd family. The techniques I observed in that video are not how HPD trains officers. The training we conduct reflects the role and responsibility of an officer to protect and safeguard suspects in custody as well as the public. This is paramount to what we do. We have no training that equates to the total disregard for life that was displayed in that video. We recognize the pain and concern this incident has brought to our community.

""If you don't like it or you're offended/ & or uncomfortable,"" he wrote, ""please unfollow me NOW !"" The rising senior linebacker on Auburn's football team did continue to speak out throughout a weekend of unrest in America. He said that anything less than conviction for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter after he pressed his knee into the back of the head of George Floyd — an unarmed black man whose crime was using a counterfeit $20 bill — for nearly nine minutes, eventually killing him, ""ain't good enough."" He said that ""silence is extremely loud"" and ""also betrayal."" That people are ""tired of not being heard."" That ""not speaking up because you don't want to offend anyone, or 'don't know what to say' is not an excuse. You are apart (sic) of the problem too."" And when protests spread nationwide on Friday and into the weekend, Wooten used his platform (he has close to 5,000 followers) to further share videos of the good — such as a Flint, Michigan, sheriff joining a peaceful march — and, unfortunately, much more bad — police using brutal force against protesters, tasing and forcefully removing a man and woman from their car in Atlanta, and firing rubber bullets at people standing on their own front porch in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis. Fellow linebacker O.C. Brothers, defensive back Traivon Leonard, quarterback Bo Nix, offensive lineman Keiondre Jones, softball player Alyssa Rivera and gymnast Sam Cerio were among the other current and former Auburn athletes who spoke out on Twitter. ""Be part of the change,"" Cerio wrote. ""When we come together as a group and love one another for our differences, that’s when change happens.

""For us in our athletics department, our North Star and our guiding light continues to be to educate, develop, support our student-athletes at any opportunity. This is certainly a time where they need our guidance,"" Greene said. ""My simple advice is: Listen to your neighbor. Take the opportunity to hear somebody out. Just listen. Care enough to engage in others who aren’t like you, who may have a different perspective on life, who may see the world through a different lens, and be OK knowing that their differences — you have to welcome them. I know some conversations are uncomfortable, but this discomfort allows us to grow through acknowledgement and empathy. At Auburn, our student-athletes, they deserve to have a safe space to be heard. All people deserve to have a safe space to be heard so that we can learn and grow and make a difference. “After speaking to our head coaches, we will certainly recommit ourselves to processing these challenging times and to channel our energies into positive, constructive action. I’ll certainly admit, being a leader under these unique circumstances is difficult, and we must handle all these things delicately and authentically. I guess, rest assured, know that our Auburn family and our athletics family will extend grace and forgiveness and will also demand decency. We will demand dignity and we will demand respect for all, and together we will find a way to use our influence for good."" “Issues of racial injustice and systemic inequities are complex, and often leave us angered, confused, conflicted and uncertain as to how to produce meaningful dialogue.”  We must do better!

Protesters filled all four corners at the intersection of College Street and Magnolia Ave. They held signs, wore masks and chanted things such as ""George Floyd"" and ""Justice now."" At multiple points, they moved into the intersection and were led in chants of ""Don't shoot"" and ""Get off my neck."" But it appeared at all times to be orderly and organized; some protesters even helped cars stuck at lights move through traffic or turn around. The streets cleared quickly. After a little more than an hour at Toomer's Corner, protesters marched to the Auburn police station on North Ross Street, where they held a nine-minute moment of silence in honor of Floyd. Auburn linebackers coach Travis Williams, along with his 9-year-old daughter, and former Tigers football player Trovon Reed were among those who took part. ""As a kid I saw videos of protest etc."" Reed tweeted. ""In a million years I never thought I’ll ever be a part of one!

(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban and athletic director Greg Byrne both released statements on Sunday, after days of protests against police brutality on people of color around the nation. “I am shocked and angered by the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahamud Arbery,” Saban’s statement said. “We’re at an important moment for our country, and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy and most important ... it’s time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us. “I’ve always been inspired and encouraged by examples set by those who came before us like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and so many others who devoted their lives to finding peaceful ways to rid our society of social inequities. As Dr. King said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied to a single garment of destiny. Whatever addicts one directly, affects all indirectly.’ “We are all part of this and we must banish these types of injustices in not just our country, but our world. The ultimate future of our nation is in our hands, and like the teams I’ve been privileged to coach, we must depend on and respect each other no matter our differences. We must come together as a society and treat one another with respect and dignity.” Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne took over for former AD Bill Battle in March. (Photo: AP) Byrne’s statement said UA athletics has taken the previous several days to, “engage, listen and be present with our student-athletes, coaches and staff.” “Our commitment to our student-athletes, our staff and our community goes far beyond competition,” Byrne’s statement said. “We are here to celebrate victories, but we are also here to support and extend a helping hand through life’s challenges. “It is important that we not only speak of the awareness but also engage with conversation and action. We all have the ability to show love, grace, compassion, kindness, support and understanding for the people in our lives. It could be one person that you impact or it could be thousands. It does not matter the number. What matters is that we make a commitment to these actions.” Head and assistant coaches of football and basketball teams around the country have taken to social media with their own statements on the subject. In the SEC, Georgia coach Kirby Smart released a statement on Saturday while Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason put his thoughts in a Twitter thread. Before Saban released his statement, UA President Stuart R. Bell released his own statement, including the following: “At the University of Alabama our core principles include fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect for every member of our community, whether we are together in Tuscaloosa or engaging virtually throughout the world. Bias, violence and acts of hate contradict those values. As a community, we must remain united in our resolve to address such injustices in meaningful ways. Our University, preparing some of the brightest minds in the country for leadership in an increasingly diverse and global society, must be a beacon of hope, equality and inclusion. “As president, I pledge to continue promoting a safe and respectful environment for every member of our campus community, and to support those who are particular targets of hate and racism. At UA, we will continue to do more and be better because of the efforts and kindness of our incredible students, faculty and staff.” A protest was held in Tuscaloosa on Sunday at the Tuscaloosa Federal Court House. There is a Facebook group (PEACEFUL PROTEST — TUSCALOOSA) for another protest scheduled from 3-6 p.m. Wednesday. UA is allowing student-athletes to return to campus on June 8, with football players coming first before basketball players in what Byrne called a phased return of athletes.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said.

Ross Jr. is the president of Alabama State University. (Photo: Kirsten Fiscus/Advertiser) For the past few days, I, like many others have been viewing through the lens of the media, the reaction of our country to the deplorable and senseless death of yet another defenseless black person at the hands of a white police officer, a tragic mockery to the truth that Black Lives Matter. Similar to other Americans, I am overcome with a range of emotions. As the father of two sons and as a black man myself, I can assure you that I am furious and deeply saddened by the death of George Floyd, as I am by every senseless killing of black males and females in America. It could have been either of my sons, my brothers, my nephews or nieces, my friends or even one of my students who lay on the ground, pleading for mercy on that horrific day. Looking into the eyes of my 11-year-old son and trying to help him comprehend what happened and what is happening in our nation, I am cognizant of the fact that I am old enough only to have read about the many civil rights protests and nonviolent demonstrations that have afforded me the opportunities that I have enjoyed during my lifetime. While I was not an eyewitness to the protests, I do try to paint a picture for my son, drawing from my exposure to many civil rights icons and their recounting of historic events of the past, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the march from Selma to Montgomery, the brutality of law enforcement officers such as Bull Connor and the story of Ruby Bridges. I am emotionally distraught about the stark parallel of our nation’s present state of affairs and our nation’s historical past. I have been giving thought to this national crisis, especially as it relates to Alabama State University’s rich history and her overwhelming contributions to the advancement of civil rights in the nation. I am one of thousands of students who have matriculated and emerged from ASU with purpose and a true understanding of social justice and responsibility. At ASU, we learnedthe importance and the power of the vote. The call to public service and advocacy was ingrained in our DNA by O’ Mother Dear. While I attempt to give some sensible explanation to the most recent senseless acts of brutality, I have reflected on my first real encounter with the reality of racist police violence against blacks in America. It was the spring of 1991, just prior to my senior year in college, and I had just been elected President of the Student Government Association. This was the time that our nation witnessed Rodney King being brutally beaten by Los Angeles law enforcement officers after he led them on a high-speed chase. I remember asking myself, “Is this what would happen to me as a black man if I found myself in a similar situation with authorities?” I vividly recall how the nation erupted into protests because of Rodney King’s mistreatment, just like the protests that have erupted nationally because of the senseless death of George Floyd and others. Each incident is similar to the protests that happened across this nation in the 1960s due to social injustice. As a young student, I was confused and enraged by what I witnessed. I remember the rumbling of unrest within our student body regarding Rodney King. We were all ready to act on our anger and frustration by taking to the streets of Montgomery to let our voices be heard. Word of our intentions reached our President, the late Dr. C. C. Baker, who later became one of my mentors. My SGA leadership team and I were summoned to Dr. Baker’s office, and it was there that I learned what social protesting was really all about. It is not about the destruction of property, looting or acting disorderly; it is about banding together peacefully with a common goal, with a purpose and a plan for change. During the meeting, we discussed our desire to be heard and our passion for change, and emerged with a plan for a peaceful protest on the campus that historically has been a beacon for change—our home, our haven—Alabama State University. This focusing event allowed me to lead my first press conference. It would be the first time I had ever spoken in front of news cameras. Every news outlet in the city was on campus that day as students gathered with community stakeholders in great numbers. I led the protest with a speech. Students and local elected officials were also able to have their voices heard as the media captured our impassioned sentiments and broadcast the event. I share this personal experience not only to highlight the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in providing a platform for change, but also to emphasize the need to protest peacefully and with a purpose. I offer that advice while understanding and even relating to the rage that has been unleashed across the nation by the infection of racism that is more potent than ever in America. Our nation has a new and improved infection of racism when George Floyd can plead for mercy while dying publicly under the force of a racist man’s knee just as his forefathers died publicly hanging from a noose. There is a new and improved infection of racism when a young man by the name of Michael Brown can hold his hands up in surrender and still be shot to death in broad daylight in Ferguson, Missouri. There is a new and improved infection of racism when a man by the name of Eric Garner in New York City can tell authorities “I can’t breathe” as he is choked to death. The infection of racism is new and improved when a young man by the name of Trayvon Martin is gunned down in cold blood while walking from the store to his home. Racism is new and improved when Ahmaud Arbery can be gunned down while jogging not far from his home. There is a new and improved infection of racism when Breonna Taylor can be shot and killed by police officers as she lay sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. Let us not forget the infection of racism that related to the death of Sandra Bland, who was found hanged in a jail cell in Walker County, Texas, after being arrested for a minor traffic stop. Here in Montgomery, there is a new and improved infection of racism when a man by the name of Greg Gunn, who attended ASU, is chased and killed by a police officer just a few steps from his mother’s front door. Their tragic deaths made headlines, but across this nation and even in this city, we could easily add more names to the rolls of those whose lives have been so tragically cut short with no cell phone cameras to capture their last, painful breaths. With this in mind, we struggle with the question, “What should we tell our students?” The answer that I offer you is the same that I give to my sons. I ask that you find ways to protest peacefully, including exercising your personal responsibility to register to vote and then go vote, and committing yourself to continuing your education so that you are prepared to emerge as this nation’s next generation of leaders. I ask that you resist the temptation to channel your anger into destruction; instead, channel your energy into the very thing that disturbs and disrupts those who would oppress you: Education. Our nonviolent stand proved successful in the past, and I believe it could be the catalyst for real and impactful change today. Let peace be at the core of all of our actions. While it seems as though remaining calm in the midst of a racist storm is a signal to be disrespected, disregarded and endangered, remember the lives that were lost to get us to this day. Remember the examples of those who were brutally beaten and rose up from that brutality to walk the halls of congress, to become mayors, governors, state legislators and community leaders. They are the ones upon whose shoulders we stand. Their sacrifices have afforded us the opportunity to stand and take up the mantle of peace, justice and equality for all. Stay in the fight against injustice my children and my students, with peace, purpose and a plan that saves us from self-destruction and allows us all to “breathe” freely. Dr. Quinton T. Ross Jr. is the president of Alabama State University.

(Photo: Todd Van Emst, AP) AUBURN — On Friday, Chandler Wooten tweeted that he was going to continue speaking out. ""If you don't like it or you're offended/ & or uncomfortable,"" he wrote, ""please unfollow me NOW !"" The rising senior linebacker on Auburn's football team did continue to speak out throughout a weekend of unrest in America. He said that anything less than conviction for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter after he pressed his knee into the back of the head of George Floyd — an unarmed black man whose crime was using a counterfeit $20 bill — for nearly nine minutes, eventually killing him, ""ain't good enough."" He said that ""silence is extremely loud"" and ""also betrayal."" That people are ""tired of not being heard."" That ""not speaking up because you don't want to offend anyone, or 'don't know what to say' is not an excuse. You are apart (sic) of the problem too."" And when protests spread nationwide on Friday and into the weekend, Wooten used his platform (he has close to 5,000 followers) to further share videos of the good — such as a Flint, Michigan, sheriff joining a peaceful march — and, unfortunately, much more bad — police using brutal force against protesters, tasing and forcefully removing a man and woman from their car in Atlanta, and firing rubber bullets at people standing on their own front porch in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis. Fellow linebacker O.C. Brothers, defensive back Traivon Leonard, quarterback Bo Nix, offensive lineman Keiondre Jones, softball player Alyssa Rivera and gymnast Sam Cerio were among the other current and former Auburn athletes who spoke out on Twitter. ""Be part of the change,"" Cerio wrote. ""When we come together as a group and love one another for our differences, that’s when change happens. I will never know what it feels like to live like an African-American, but I stand and support the equality and justice you all deserve."" If I commit a crime with three other people ....

So why haven’t the other officers been charged? — CWoot (@ItsMeWootang) May 31, 2020 On Saturday, Auburn athletic director Allen Greene — the first African-American athletic director in school history, just the third in SEC history, and the leader of a program made up of hundreds of athletes from many different backgrounds — posted a video with the message: ""Follow your North Star."" ""For us in our athletics department, our North Star and our guiding light continues to be to educate, develop, support our student-athletes at any opportunity. This is certainly a time where they need our guidance,"" Greene said. ""My simple advice is: Listen to your neighbor. Take the opportunity to hear somebody out. Just listen. Care enough to engage in others who aren’t like you, who may have a different perspective on life, who may see the world through a different lens, and be OK knowing that their differences — you have to welcome them. I know some conversations are uncomfortable, but this discomfort allows us to grow through acknowledgement and empathy. At Auburn, our student-athletes, they deserve to have a safe space to be heard. All people deserve to have a safe space to be heard so that we can learn and grow and make a difference. “After speaking to our head coaches, we will certainly recommit ourselves to processing these challenging times and to channel our energies into positive, constructive action. I’ll certainly admit, being a leader under these unique circumstances is difficult, and we must handle all these things delicately and authentically. I guess, rest assured, know that our Auburn family and our athletics family will extend grace and forgiveness and will also demand decency. We will demand dignity and we will demand respect for all, and together we will find a way to use our influence for good."" “Issues of racial injustice and systemic inequities are complex, and often leave us angered, confused, conflicted and uncertain as to how to produce meaningful dialogue.”  We must do better!

""Then through love and understanding, prayer and practice let’s try and improve our world! We can and we must do better!""

Protesters filled all four corners at the intersection of College Street and Magnolia Ave. They held signs, wore masks and chanted things such as ""George Floyd"" and ""Justice now."" At multiple points, they moved into the intersection and were led in chants of ""Don't shoot"" and ""Get off my neck."" But it appeared at all times to be orderly and organized; some protesters even helped cars stuck at lights move through traffic or turn around. The streets cleared quickly. After a little more than an hour at Toomer's Corner, protesters marched to the Auburn police station on North Ross Street, where they held a nine-minute moment of silence in honor of Floyd. Auburn linebackers coach Travis Williams, along with his 9-year-old daughter, and former Tigers football player Trovon Reed were among those who took part. ""As a kid I saw videos of protest etc."" Reed tweeted. ""In a million years I never thought I’ll ever be a part of one!

(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban and athletic director Greg Byrne both released statements on Sunday, after days of protests against police brutality on people of color around the nation. “I am shocked and angered by the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahamud Arbery,” Saban’s statement said. “We’re at an important moment for our country, and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy and most important ... it’s time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us. “I’ve always been inspired and encouraged by examples set by those who came before us like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and so many others who devoted their lives to finding peaceful ways to rid our society of social inequities. As Dr. King said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied to a single garment of destiny. Whatever addicts one directly, affects all indirectly.’ “We are all part of this and we must banish these types of injustices in not just our country, but our world. The ultimate future of our nation is in our hands, and like the teams I’ve been privileged to coach, we must depend on and respect each other no matter our differences. We must come together as a society and treat one another with respect and dignity.” Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne took over for former AD Bill Battle in March. (Photo: AP) Byrne’s statement said UA athletics has taken the previous several days to, “engage, listen and be present with our student-athletes, coaches and staff.” “Our commitment to our student-athletes, our staff and our community goes far beyond competition,” Byrne’s statement said. “We are here to celebrate victories, but we are also here to support and extend a helping hand through life’s challenges. “It is important that we not only speak of the awareness but also engage with conversation and action. We all have the ability to show love, grace, compassion, kindness, support and understanding for the people in our lives. It could be one person that you impact or it could be thousands. It does not matter the number. What matters is that we make a commitment to these actions.” Head and assistant coaches of football and basketball teams around the country have taken to social media with their own statements on the subject. In the SEC, Georgia coach Kirby Smart released a statement on Saturday while Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason put his thoughts in a Twitter thread. Before Saban released his statement, UA President Stuart R. Bell released his own statement, including the following: “At the University of Alabama our core principles include fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect for every member of our community, whether we are together in Tuscaloosa or engaging virtually throughout the world. Bias, violence and acts of hate contradict those values. As a community, we must remain united in our resolve to address such injustices in meaningful ways. Our University, preparing some of the brightest minds in the country for leadership in an increasingly diverse and global society, must be a beacon of hope, equality and inclusion. “As president, I pledge to continue promoting a safe and respectful environment for every member of our campus community, and to support those who are particular targets of hate and racism. At UA, we will continue to do more and be better because of the efforts and kindness of our incredible students, faculty and staff.” A protest was held in Tuscaloosa on Sunday at the Tuscaloosa Federal Court House. There is a Facebook group (PEACEFUL PROTEST — TUSCALOOSA) for another protest scheduled from 3-6 p.m. Wednesday. UA is allowing student-athletes to return to campus on June 8, with football players coming first before basketball players in what Byrne called a phased return of athletes.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said.

Ross Jr. is the president of Alabama State University. (Photo: Kirsten Fiscus/Advertiser) For the past few days, I, like many others have been viewing through the lens of the media, the reaction of our country to the deplorable and senseless death of yet another defenseless black person at the hands of a white police officer, a tragic mockery to the truth that Black Lives Matter. Similar to other Americans, I am overcome with a range of emotions. As the father of two sons and as a black man myself, I can assure you that I am furious and deeply saddened by the death of George Floyd, as I am by every senseless killing of black males and females in America. It could have been either of my sons, my brothers, my nephews or nieces, my friends or even one of my students who lay on the ground, pleading for mercy on that horrific day. Looking into the eyes of my 11-year-old son and trying to help him comprehend what happened and what is happening in our nation, I am cognizant of the fact that I am old enough only to have read about the many civil rights protests and nonviolent demonstrations that have afforded me the opportunities that I have enjoyed during my lifetime. While I was not an eyewitness to the protests, I do try to paint a picture for my son, drawing from my exposure to many civil rights icons and their recounting of historic events of the past, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the march from Selma to Montgomery, the brutality of law enforcement officers such as Bull Connor and the story of Ruby Bridges. I am emotionally distraught about the stark parallel of our nation’s present state of affairs and our nation’s historical past. I have been giving thought to this national crisis, especially as it relates to Alabama State University’s rich history and her overwhelming contributions to the advancement of civil rights in the nation. I am one of thousands of students who have matriculated and emerged from ASU with purpose and a true understanding of social justice and responsibility. At ASU, we learnedthe importance and the power of the vote. The call to public service and advocacy was ingrained in our DNA by O’ Mother Dear. While I attempt to give some sensible explanation to the most recent senseless acts of brutality, I have reflected on my first real encounter with the reality of racist police violence against blacks in America. It was the spring of 1991, just prior to my senior year in college, and I had just been elected President of the Student Government Association. This was the time that our nation witnessed Rodney King being brutally beaten by Los Angeles law enforcement officers after he led them on a high-speed chase. I remember asking myself, “Is this what would happen to me as a black man if I found myself in a similar situation with authorities?” I vividly recall how the nation erupted into protests because of Rodney King’s mistreatment, just like the protests that have erupted nationally because of the senseless death of George Floyd and others. Each incident is similar to the protests that happened across this nation in the 1960s due to social injustice. As a young student, I was confused and enraged by what I witnessed. I remember the rumbling of unrest within our student body regarding Rodney King. We were all ready to act on our anger and frustration by taking to the streets of Montgomery to let our voices be heard. Word of our intentions reached our President, the late Dr. C. C. Baker, who later became one of my mentors. My SGA leadership team and I were summoned to Dr. Baker’s office, and it was there that I learned what social protesting was really all about. It is not about the destruction of property, looting or acting disorderly; it is about banding together peacefully with a common goal, with a purpose and a plan for change. During the meeting, we discussed our desire to be heard and our passion for change, and emerged with a plan for a peaceful protest on the campus that historically has been a beacon for change—our home, our haven—Alabama State University. This focusing event allowed me to lead my first press conference. It would be the first time I had ever spoken in front of news cameras. Every news outlet in the city was on campus that day as students gathered with community stakeholders in great numbers. I led the protest with a speech. Students and local elected officials were also able to have their voices heard as the media captured our impassioned sentiments and broadcast the event. I share this personal experience not only to highlight the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in providing a platform for change, but also to emphasize the need to protest peacefully and with a purpose. I offer that advice while understanding and even relating to the rage that has been unleashed across the nation by the infection of racism that is more potent than ever in America. Our nation has a new and improved infection of racism when George Floyd can plead for mercy while dying publicly under the force of a racist man’s knee just as his forefathers died publicly hanging from a noose. There is a new and improved infection of racism when a young man by the name of Michael Brown can hold his hands up in surrender and still be shot to death in broad daylight in Ferguson, Missouri. There is a new and improved infection of racism when a man by the name of Eric Garner in New York City can tell authorities “I can’t breathe” as he is choked to death. The infection of racism is new and improved when a young man by the name of Trayvon Martin is gunned down in cold blood while walking from the store to his home. Racism is new and improved when Ahmaud Arbery can be gunned down while jogging not far from his home. There is a new and improved infection of racism when Breonna Taylor can be shot and killed by police officers as she lay sleeping in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. Let us not forget the infection of racism that related to the death of Sandra Bland, who was found hanged in a jail cell in Walker County, Texas, after being arrested for a minor traffic stop. Here in Montgomery, there is a new and improved infection of racism when a man by the name of Greg Gunn, who attended ASU, is chased and killed by a police officer just a few steps from his mother’s front door. Their tragic deaths made headlines, but across this nation and even in this city, we could easily add more names to the rolls of those whose lives have been so tragically cut short with no cell phone cameras to capture their last, painful breaths. With this in mind, we struggle with the question, “What should we tell our students?” The answer that I offer you is the same that I give to my sons. I ask that you find ways to protest peacefully, including exercising your personal responsibility to register to vote and then go vote, and committing yourself to continuing your education so that you are prepared to emerge as this nation’s next generation of leaders. I ask that you resist the temptation to channel your anger into destruction; instead, channel your energy into the very thing that disturbs and disrupts those who would oppress you: Education. Our nonviolent stand proved successful in the past, and I believe it could be the catalyst for real and impactful change today. Let peace be at the core of all of our actions. While it seems as though remaining calm in the midst of a racist storm is a signal to be disrespected, disregarded and endangered, remember the lives that were lost to get us to this day. Remember the examples of those who were brutally beaten and rose up from that brutality to walk the halls of congress, to become mayors, governors, state legislators and community leaders. They are the ones upon whose shoulders we stand. Their sacrifices have afforded us the opportunity to stand and take up the mantle of peace, justice and equality for all. Stay in the fight against injustice my children and my students, with peace, purpose and a plan that saves us from self-destruction and allows us all to “breathe” freely. Dr. Quinton T. Ross Jr. is the president of Alabama State University.

As protests across the nation over the 46-year-old’s killing in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota, fostered violence and looting, the Tuscaloosa Peaceful Racial Justice Rally lived up to its name. No one was injured as Tuscaloosa Police and protesters alike commingled throughout the event that organizers Sarah N. Cheshire and Nicole Gelb Dugat described as ""a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with protesters across the country speaking out about racial injustices in the United States."" Before the march around the courthouse that, with the crowd size, took more than three minutes for everyone to pass by, local poet Andrea L. Dobynes read a poem that spoke of the fears that a black woman has over bringing a new son into this world. She was preceded by the Rev. Hollis J. Thomas of Tuscaloosa’s Rock City Church who addressed the frustration that, oftentimes, the voices of black people aren’t heard, no matter how loudly they cry out. ""We spend years talking, but no one can hear us,"" Thomas said. ""My prayer is that, if they can’t hear me, then hopefully – prayerfully – they’ll hear us."" That’s why it was important for those like Tuscaloosa resident Jeffery Wilson, 36, to turn out to make his voice heard and presence felt as the nation reels over the latest death of a black man while in police custody. ""I’m am him. I am Mr. George … and I am anyone that gets treated with injustice,"" Wilson said. ""I wanted to make sure I was a part of history."" With Tuscaloosa Police Chief Brent Blankley handing out bottles of cold water to participants nearby, Wilson said it was inspiring to see the diversity of the crowd, noting that he believes the youth among them will be the ones to make lives better for his fellow black residents. ""We are mixed and we all stand to say we are tired and this is not how we want our America to be. This is not what we want,"" Wilson said. ""It’s not our grandparents that are here now. It’s the young people. It’s the millennials. ""They’re the people that are going to make the new laws. They’re going to be the new congressmen. They’re going to be the new mayors. This is the new generation that’s coming up today."" Hayes Dobbins, 42, came with her mother, Shirley Coager, to take part in the rally. Coager, who herself took part in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. ""This shouldn’t be happening again,"" Coager said. ""We went through this a long time ago."" But because it is, Dobbins said it was important to her to show up in support of her fellow Tuscaloosa residents. ""It was important for me to come out and show that I stand with my black brothers and sisters,"" Dobbins said. ""But I stand with everyone, because poor people really get it from the cops just as much, but it’s more predominant with black people."" Dobbins said the news of Floyd’s death moved her to tears and, for that reason, ""I just couldn’t sit at home."" ""I had to come out to show that I don’t agree with that police brutality,"" she said. ""I hope they know that we care and we’re grieving with them, and we’re against this and we don’t want it to happen anymore."" It’s that kind of spirit that also led Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox to label Floyd’s death ""a murder"" that ""has to mean something."" Maddox noted that on Monday, the day after Sunday’s rally, the state of Alabama will officially celebrate the birthdate of Jefferson Davis, who served as the lone president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. ""There are deep divides in this country,"" Maddox said. ""There are vast schisms of misunderstandings. When you have a moment like this, and potentially a rare moment in American history, that we can begin to bridge those divides, we have to seize it. ""Minnesota is many miles away from Tuscaloosa, but we can do something in every corner of this nation to begin building trust with each other so that we can begin to finally conquer the many societal ills that we see.""",0.0

Mayor Randall Woodfin appealed for calm in a city known for civil rights demonstrations that turned violent when segregationist officials used dogs and fire hoses on protesters in the 1960s. ""Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest. Violence, bullying and chaos is not the road to reform,"" Woodfin told a news conference while announcing efforts to quell the mayhem of a few hours earlier. A city-wide curfew will begin at 7 p.m. nightly, he said. Woodfin requested assistance from state police, an aide said, but he didn't immediately accept Gov. Kay Ivey's offer of National Guard troops. Hundreds of people gathered peacefully in a downtown park, chanting and listening to speakers decrying police brutality, on Sunday before night fell. Some in the crowd toppled a bronze statue of city industrialist Charles Linn, who served in the Confederate Navy, but they couldn't budge a huge stone obelisk honoring the Confederacy, instead battering it with stones and hammers. Video showed crowds then moved into commercial areas, and police said more than two dozen businesses were looted or damaged. Two dozen people were arrested, Woodfin said, and two members of the media were injured in attacks. The following morning, Wheelhouse Salon owner Johnny Grimes cleaned up smashed windows and determined how much of his computer equipment had been stolen by looters. The business had just been cleared to reopen after being shut down for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Grimes said he was frustrated by the destruction but sympathizes with demonstrators. ""I hope that this isn't all for nothing. I hope that this does spark some type of national conversation on race, racial reconciliation, police brutality and how the African American, black community is treated in America,"" said Grimes, who is white. Protests have erupted around the country to protest the death of Floyd, an African American man, on May 25. Floyd was on the ground and handcuffed when a white police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Woodfin said the city will try to take down the strong Confederate monument but will see if it can be given to a museum or other group. He said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments, is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. Both peaceful protests and confrontations between police and demonstrations also occurred in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover and Mobile, where media outlets reported that police used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds. Gov. Kay Ivey said state assistance was available to any city that asks. ""What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is,"" she said in a statement. ""Going forward, this cannot be tolerated."" The Birmingham mayor made a plea for peace, saying civil disobedience wasn't the same as civil unrest. ""Birmingham the world is watching,"" Woodfin said.

The mood began to turn at Linn Park in Birmingham on Sunday evening when protestors began to deface and then attempted to take down a Confederate monument during a rally for George Floyd. The statue of Charles Linn was ripped from its foundation and cast upon the ground as the night devolved into mayhem. The move to take down the statue began during a speech from comedian Jermaine “FunnyMaine” Johnson as the crowd gathered to protest the murder of George Floyd, who was killed by a Minnesota police officer. Demonstrators first took down the plywood barrier protecting the monument and then spray painted and chipped away at it. They then placed a rope around the monument and attempted to pull it down. Officers from the Birmingham Police Department were on the scene and did not attempt to intervene. The protestors then spilled into the streets of Birmingham were bars and restaurants were vandalized. Reporters covering the events were attacked and gunshots could be heard throughout the city. The move by demonstrators on Sunday followed the reports that 20 people were arrested at a protest near Hoover City Hall late Saturday night. Most of those arrests resulted in disorderly conduct charges after protesters blocked traffic on Montgomery Highway, Hoover police Lt. Keith Czeskleba said. Other charges included criminal trespass and resisting arrest, and one person was charged with carrying a firearm during a demonstration.

The demonstrations in Birmingham began at Linn Park on Sunday, May 31, 2020. Protesters attempted several times to take down the Confederate monument in the park. Mayor Woodfin showed up on the scene and said he would work to have the monument removed. Woodfin said Birmingham Police were outnumbered at Linn Park and that the Chief of Police Patrick Smith made the decision for the officers to not engage with protesters. After the protesters disbursed from Linn Park, riots broke out across the city and police were activated. Several buildings were broken into including the Wells Fargo, Alabama Power, Jim Burke Nissan and the ABC Store. Police responded to several scenes to try and break up the rioting. At least two journalists were attacked and injured while covering the breaking news. Monday morning, Woodfin addressed the city on a YouTube livestream. He asked anyone with information on who attacked the journalists to call police and share video. “Too many people saw that and didn’t do anything,” Woodfin said. “That bothers me and it should bother you. I’m offended by it and if you’re not offended by it, you need to check yourself.” There were 22 fires in the city on Sunday night. Five of those were commercial buildings. Fourteen buildings were burglarized. In all, Woodfin said 24 people were arrested. Woodfin said the focus should be justice for George Floyd. “George Floyd,” Woodfin said. “That is a name that we all know now. Not just in the city of Minneapolis, not just in the city of Birmingham, not just in America, but the world. George Floyd.” Woodfin said the death of Floyd is striking a chord and bringing about anger and fear. “Many of us have expressed that in ways I think that is very fair,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of things across the nation none of us like.” The mayor said the city shows its best side when people come together in solidarity. “What started out with the best intentions turned into something that none of us deserve,” Woodfin continued. Woodfin said he supports activism but not mobs and not civil unrest. “Birmingham, this is not us,” Woodfin said. “This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest. Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform.” Woodfin has put into place a curfew of 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice. Exceptions will be made for essential workers. “We are not playing,” the mayor added. “We will enforce the law.” The city of Birmingham declared a state of emergency and has asked for support from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency but as of now, he said the National Guard will not be activated.",0.0

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

(AP) "" Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. 'I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,' Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual 'walkout' to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers 'took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. 'I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,' tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 'likes' and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. 'I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,' Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's 'decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.' 'I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,' she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. 'We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback,' Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. 'We need to know George Floyd's name. But it's clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don't amplify bias,' Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag.",0.0

Well over 1,000 protesters initially showed up at Mardi Gras Park to begin a march in a show of support for George Floyd, the black man who died after Minneapolis Police officer Darren Chauvin was shown on video kneeling on his throat May 25. Marchers shouted “I can’t breathe” in solidarity with Floyd. “What I told my people — my people meaning blacks, whites, latinos, everybody — is we’re going to come together and we’re going to have a peaceful protest,” Local civil rights activist and protest organizer Sabrina Mass said. “We will not destroy our city.” Advertisements Speaking to Lagniappe, Battiste said the initial march had been peaceful, adding he understood the protestors were “emotional” and “have a right to show that emotion.” Unlike police forces in other cities, Mobile officers showed up in regular uniforms and not in riot gear.  Battiste said officers did not want to do anything to agitate the crowd. “We wanted to allow them to express their position without fear of conflict,” he said.  Mass said that tactic was appreciated, as she blamed police in other cities for riling up protesters. Shortly after the march ended, tensions escalated and police fired as many as two canisters of tear gas into a small crowd of protesters and the window was smashed out of a police-issued Chevrolet Tahoe, according to Assistant Chief Roy Hodge.  A line of police officers — both on foot and on horseback — blocked the on ramp, while protesters yelled at police and each other. Public Safety Director James Barber spoke with some of the protestors who remained in the area and tried to disrupt traffic, and with help from some of the event’s initial organizers, was eventually able to convince the group to leave the area. Event organizer Sabrina Mass spoke with Public Safety Director James Barber and eventually they were able to get protestors to leave the onramp of I-10 near Water Street. A small group from an otherwise peaceful protest tried to disrupt traffic on Interstate 10, resulting in MPD officers deploying tear gas.

A small group from an otherwise peaceful protest tried to disrupt traffic on Interstate 10, resulting in MPD officers deploying tear gas.  Mass, who stood between officers and other protesters, told Lagniappe at the scene a group not affiliated with her efforts was responsible for the escalation by moving toward the interstate. She accused the group of trying to incite a riot. “I’m keeping the peace,” Mass said, standing between the officers and other protesters. “The inciters tried to get on the interstate.” Ariel Parker said the group she was with was not inciting a riot, but was instead trying to peacefully protest when police attacked them with tear gas. “There were a lot of people worked up after the tear gas,” Parker added. Lashay Yost also said the group she was with was peacefully protesting and that “citizens just want to be heard.” Like Mass, Barber also blamed the escalation on “local and outside agitators.” He called them “professional,” and said moving onto an interstate is an escalation tactic used all over the country. “They knew it would draw police over,” he said. Hodge confirmed that while there was damage to a Tahoe and tear gas was deployed, officers were able to de-escalate the situation without any injuries or arrests. Earlier, along the route of the initial march, there was a verbal altercation with two men, one of whom was chanting “white lives matter” in response to the protestors. The situation nearly escalated before it was broken up by a pair of MPD officers. At least one of the two men, both of whom were white, had a handgun by his side. Some members of the crowd broke away from the march to confront the men, who began backing up as the group moved closer. Eventually, another protestor interjected telling the crowd “that’s not what we’re here for” and “this is exactly what they want.” After a few choice words it was enough to get the splintered group of protestors to rejoin the march down Dauphin Street.  The police then exchanged words with the two white men after ordering them to leave the area, though they eventually complied and left on foot.  Elsewhere on the route, Battiste actually personally intervened to take what he called an “assault style” weapon from one man participating in the protest, who identified himself as Antonio Moore. Speaking to Lagniappe, Moore said he was exercising his right to openly carry his weapon, adding it wasn’t loaded and his magazines were kept separately in his pockets.  Battiste told Moore there was a city ordinance that prevented the open carry of weapons at Mardi Gras and other events with large numbers of people, though he could not specifically identify the name or number of that ordinance. Lagniappe has tried to identify that code but has not yet received additional information from the Mobile Police Department.  Moore initially compiled without incident and Battiste told him he’d have his weapon returned at the end of the demonstration. However, when he later questioned Battiste and asked for more specific information, he was escorted by officers to take the weapon back to his car. More information will be posted on this once it’s received from MPD. Moore, who is black, noted that the white man who got into an altercation with protestors and placed his hand on his loaded weapon did not have his gun confiscated by officers.  Following the march, Cory Penn stood at the back of Mardi Gras park, taking in the scene. However, he was somewhat conflicted by it. “I feel good in a way because we are together in a peaceful way,” he said. “I wish I wasn’t out here. It’s sad Mr. Floyd was killed that way. We have to find a better way and do a better job to find justice.” Standing a few feet away from Penn, Roderick Moss said he sometimes fears for his 19-year-old son. He said black parents try to teach their children to comply with the police, but sometimes even when they comply they’re killed. The diversity of Mobile’s crowd sent a message to Moss that change is on the way. “We’re all just tired of it,” he said. “It’s time to make some change.” In a message on his social media channels Sunday morning, Mayor Sandy Stimpson posted about the Floyd case and racism that still lingers in American society. “We share the pain and frustration being expressed by so many in the wake of the tragedy,” he wrote. “We join the voices demanding justice. There is a systemic problem which must be addressed at every level in America, from local to federal government.” Stimpson added the city has “worked hard to build a relationship between law enforcement and the community,” but also acknowledged that its work is still not done. “We have more work to do,” he wrote. “As elected officials, community leaders, police officers and citizens, we must work together to achieve justice.” Both Batiste and Stimpson spoke to a crowd of protesters in Mardi Gras Park Sunday, with varying levels of success. When asked by the crowd about a somewhat recent case involving MPD officer Blake Duke, Stimpson seemed unable to answer many of these questions. The crowd became agitated with his lack of knowledge about what actions were taken before Duke was allowed to return to active patrols, following a high profile use-of-force incident that involved an African American man earlier this year. “There are things I don’t know and there are things you don’t know,” Stimpson said.  As Lagniappe reported, Duke was disciplined after a viral video in February showed him placing suspect Howard Green Jr. in a brief choke while he was being arrested. Duke told officers that Green had allegedly spit on him while resisting arrest before the hold was used.  Duke was immediately placed on desk duty and removed from patrols. A month later, MPD officials said “appropriate actions” had been taken to hold Duke and another officer on the scene accountable for violating MPD policy, but the department has never given any indication as to what those actions were.  Before leaving, Stimpson did tell the crowd he came to listen to them and support Battiste. “When we do that we can hear your complaints and what we need to do better,” he said. Clarification: The original version of this story implied two men who engaged in a verbal altercation with protestors chanted the phrase “white lives matter” in response. A Lagniappe reporter personally witnessed one of the men say the phrase as tensions escalated and police separated the men from the crowd. The second man, who reached out to Lagniappe, claims this is untrue and the men actually said “all lives matter.” Lagniappe reporter Jason Johnson contributed to this report",0.0

Kay Ivey has given the authorization to activate up to 1,000 members of the Alabama National Guard should “violent protests” like those seen over the weekend continue into the coming week.  As Lagniappe reported, thousands of people filled the streets of Mobile Sunday to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after Minneapolis police officer Darren Chauvin kneeled on his neck for several minutes in a video that has since gone viral and caused unrest throughout the country.  The local demonstrations were mostly peaceful, though some cars and buildings sustained mild vandalism and police had to use crowd control devices on at least two occasions — deploying tear gas into a group that tried to block Interstate 10 and pepper balls to disperse a crowd on Airport Boulevard Sunday night.  However, things were worse in Alabama’s largest city. Birmingham saw peaceful protests escalate into looting, assaults and significant vandalism. Reporters from more than one news outlet sustained injuries from unprovoked attacks and a controversial Confederate statue was toppled in a city park.  Monday morning, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin declared a state of emergency and issued a citywide curfew in effect from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. He said the city respected the rights of peaceful protestors but had no problem arresting any “looters” and “anarchists” damaging property.  In condemning Floyd’s death herself, Ivey acknowledged Alabama’s history of protests linked to the Civil Rights Movement. However, she also quoted one of that movement’s leaders, Congressman John Lewis, D-Georgia, who over the weekend said “rioting, looting and burning is not the way.” Advertisements “I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration,” Ivey said in a written statement released by her office. “However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated.”  Ivey went on to say “state assets” would be made available to any Alabama city that needs them to respond to protests or riots that escalate to violence. She also authorized Adjutant General Sheryl Gordon to activate up to 1,000 guardsmen, should they be needed to respond to “violent protesters.”  With the exception of a self-billed “peaceful protest” in the city of Madison this evening, there doesn’t appear to be any planned and organized demonstrations like there were over the weekend. However, other cities have seen massive protests, and in some areas riots, persist for days in the wake of Floyd’s death.  In her statement, Ivey said authorizing the deployment of the Alabama National Guard was “strictly a preparedness measure,” noting they haven’t been tasked to operate in any specific areas at this time.  “While there is no immediate need for us to deploy our Guard, I have given authorization to General Gordon to be on standby, should our local and state law enforcement need additional support,” she wrote. “[The Guard] stands ready to assist when peaceful protests become violent and dangerous to our public safety.”",0.0

Mass demonstrations have taken place across the country to call for justice for Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for help. Tensions have escalated as police officers have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, and some demonstrators have set buildings and cars on fire. Trump has faced some pressure to speak to the nation about the unrest. ""Everything's on the table,"" Rollins told Politico in a remote interview. ""I think ultimately he believes, and rightfully so, that he is in a constant narrative and conversation with his citizens."" Trump has been tweeting about the case and delivered lengthy remarks on the protests during a NASA event Saturday. He said he supports peaceful protests, but that looting will not be tolerated. Rollins, who heads the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the White House is examining a list of possible bipartisan ""solutions"" focused on how to bring the country together. ""How do we use this as a unifying force for this country?"" Rollins asked in the Politico interview. While Rollins talked about reaching across the aisle, Trump has repeatedly lashed out about the protests in partisan terms, calling out governors and mayors who are Democrats. He's urged officials to use the military to crack down on demonstrators. In a call Monday, Trump called governors weak and urged them to dominate protesters, according to a person on the line. Trump has also raised the protests as an election issue, slamming his Democratic rival Joe Biden. On Friday, Twitter placed a warning on a tweet from Trump that said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" referring to the protests. Twitter said the post ""glorified violence."" Trump later denied he was using the phrase as a threat. ",0.0
1622627352,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

I'm Terry Gross. Like so many Americans and people around the world, I was horrified watching the video of the police officer - now charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder - who had his knee on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, keeping the weight on Floyd's neck even after he died. My heart was broken. It was broken again over the weekend as I watched peaceful protests against the death of Floyd and other black men and women who died at the hands of police become violent confrontations in cities around America, including Philadelphia, where I live, and Brooklyn, where I grew up. Philadelphia has been preparing to allow businesses that were closed due to the pandemic to reopen this Friday. Now in the heart of our business and shopping district that also has medical offices, food markets, pharmacies and many apartments, stores have had their windows broken, been looted, some set on fire and destroyed. Just a few days ago, the streets were pretty empty, with people practicing social distancing. By the weekend, in Philly and cities around the country, thousands of people were in the streets, which public health officials fear could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19. We asked Eric Adams to join us because he has insights about this moment from several perspectives. When he was 15, he was arrested and beaten by police. He later became a police officer with the intent of helping to reform the police. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. After serving on the force for 22 years, retiring as a captain, he served in the New York State Senate for seven years. He was elected Brooklyn borough president in 2013 and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn's CEO. Brooklyn has been a pandemic hot spot and the location of large protests, some of which turned violent. Eric Adams, welcome back to FRESH AIR. We're recording this late Sunday afternoon. We don't know what will happen Sunday night. What are your concerns about the actions of the police and the protesters in Brooklyn? ERIC ADAMS: Many levels, Terry. I have mixed emotions. No. 1, I'm extremely excited and pleased to see our young people taking to the streets. Historically, the winds of change, they have always been blown by young adults. Young people are very much a part of the movement. And we're seeing that they are lifting their voices. And so I'm happy to see that, but I'm also concerned because embedded into a righteous movement is a group of well-trained people who - their goal is not police abuse but disruption. They're trained on incendiary devices, how to make them. They're trained on how to agitate. Some of them are carrying firearms. And if we're not careful, they will hijack this righteous movement, and that alarms me and concerns me. GROSS: Who do you think those well-trained people are and who do you think trained them? What do you know about that? ADAMS: It's a combination. Some of them, believe it or not - this strange marriage has been created between right-wing militias who have infiltrated the bodies of some of these movements across our country and even here in New York, and others are those who are just believers that we need to burn down our cities. I know that they had groups here staking out the city to see how police move and where police are located. I've been debriefed on some of the people who have been involved. Like, one car we found in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had several Molotov cocktails and a tank full of gasoline to make incendiary devices. The young lady who pulled up at the 88th Precinct, what happened to have been one of my precincts as an officer, she pulled up and threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle. We're seeing jeeps burned and vans burned. And the young African Americans who are fighting police abuse all across the country, they are doing it in a peaceful fashion. And if we're not careful, those who have infiltrated these peaceful, righteous groups are going to put these young people in a very harmful state. GROSS: What's your reaction, as a former police officer, to seeing police precincts in Brooklyn under attack? I mean, protesters tried to breach and enter a police precinct in Brooklyn, and outside Brooklyn's 88th Precinct, there was another large clash with crowds. What's your reaction to that? Like, how do you think police should be handling it when their precincts come under attack? ADAMS: And that's so important because look at the last series of marches that really put in place serious changes across the country. When you looked at those marches, you did not see people go into the 88th Precinct and other precincts in this city; you saw the organizers, the marches, you saw them stop businesses, stop traffic, maybe stop transportation. They were doing die-ins. They were doing real things to allow their voices to be heard. And that's why we have to ask, what's different here? How did we go from those extremely important ways of being heard to a point that we are actually trying to take over precincts, that we're firebombing vehicles? I was out last night at 1:30 in the morning on Flatbush Avenue and saw the number of businesses that were destroyed. And as I went into Clinton Hill, I saw property owners, people who actually own homes, I saw their homes damaged as well. And so we must make sure that we have the right balance between public protection from our police officers and to weed out those who are damaging what these young people are doing. I've been speaking with the Black Lives Matters organizers of Brooklyn and others who are part of the righteous pursuit to end police brutality to show them how to distance themselves from those who are trying to hijack their movement. GROSS: Would you like to see people from Black Lives Matter speaking out against the violence and distancing themselves from it? ADAMS: Yes, I would. And that is part of the conversation that I've had with some of the leaders. And I understand their concerns because they don't want to give a pathway. Sometimes when you speak out against something, it's manipulated in another fashion, and so they are extremely concerned about that. And we're trying to find a way that they can effectively distance themselves from what they're seeing but, at the same time, keep the focus on the mission of turning around police abuse. But I guess I would like to do that, and that is part of the conversations I've been having with them. GROSS: And let's get back to the police. I know - like, because we talked about this once before on the show - when you were a police officer, there were times when, during the day, you would be joining protesters against police abuse, and then in the evening, you'd be policing the protesters in your job as a police officer. And people would make assumptions about you as an officer, assumptions that were often not true, about where your sympathies lay. So let's talk about policing right now. I suspect that a lot of police officers sympathize with the protesters, yet at the same time, cannot allow violence in their cities. They can't allow the destruction of property, although all of that has happened anyways. Talk a little bit from your perspective as a former police officer what you think the police are up against and the kind of difficult decisions they have to make. ADAMS: That's a great question because - and you're right. The - remember; we recruit police officers from a society that is filled with healthy and toxic individuals. And when you come into the law enforcement arena, many of the individuals who are not suitable to be a police officer, they find root in a culture that really protected even the toxic individuals. The police department - actually, the police departments across America - they have never been good at immediately weeding out those who are not suitable. To have two of the most important rights that a human being can have in a country like America - the right to take freedom and the right to take away one's life - those are rights that not even the president - thank God, with this president - a president doesn't even have. So when you give someone those rights, you need to have an awesome amount of oversight, an awesome amount of obligation, and we have not done that historically. And when you look at the video footage - I've been closely watching the video footage, and I've been - I have intentionally went to many of the protests last night. I was - like I said, I was on Flatbush Avenue watching some of the interaction. When you look at the video footage, there's something that is glaring. There is a body of officers who are really suited to do this type of enforcement, and then there's a body of officers that are really not suited to do it. Now, what do I mean by that? And, Terry, we really need to reexamine how we assign police officers in our country. Everyone who is in the occupation is not suitable for every role in the occupation. There are officers that I, as a platoon commander, I enjoyed having with me when I had to kick in a door to go after someone that was committing a crime, had a gun. But I wouldn't want that same person with me if I was speaking to someone that was trying to talk someone off a ledge or dealing with a hostage situation. And so we don't assign officers based on their abilities to carry out the crafts that are needed in a particular time. Policing basically just brings everyone together. Saying, if you have on a blue uniform, you're suitable to do all the jobs - that is a big mistake, and we need to change that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. He's the borough president of Brooklyn. He's a former New York City police officer who co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which was a police reform group against racial profiling and police assaults. He was also assaulted by the police when he was 15. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams, and we're talking about the protests over the weekend. At age 15, he was beaten by police. And in the hope of helping reform the policing of black people and neighborhoods, he joined the New York City police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator in New York and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn Borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been a site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. It's also been a hot spot in the pandemic. Were you ever, as a police officer, patrolling a protest that turned violent? And if so, what was that like for you? What were some of the most complicated actions and decisions you had to make? ADAMS: Extremely complicated, extremely frightening. Even when you put on a blue uniform, you do not take away the fright and flight hard-wiring inside you. And the goal is I go in with the mindset - or whoever I'm working with, I'm asking them before I start it - as a football team goes into a huddle, I go into a huddle and say, listen; we are our brother's keeper. That was the No. 1 thing I told my officers at several protests. I was here in the midst of many of the stop-and-frisk protests, the Abner Louima protest, the Dorismond protest - some of the real height - and I policed under Giuliani's administration and under Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly. We had protests all the time. What I learned was that if you make sure that the officers know that you are my brother's keeper and if I am going over the edge, if I'm not doing the job the way it's supposed to because my adrenaline is flowing and I am responding instead of being the professional I ought to be, stop me, pause me, pull me to the side, take me, disengage me. And there were times when a person was extremely difficult to deal with - in some cases violent dealing with them - that you have to do the necessary force to terminate the condition. What you're seeing in some of the videos, you're seeing people handcuffed, and officers are still swinging their baton, and no one is stopping them. We're not teaching de-escalation. We teach de-escalation of the person who's committing the act; we're not teaching de-escalation of the officers who are trying to terminate the act. And I always instructed my officers when I was a sergeant, a lieutenant and a captain the skill of de-escalation and being your brother's keeper to prevent an incident getting out of hand. GROSS: We've all seen in times during the protests over the weekend when protesters were intentionally provoking the police - throwing things at them, setting their cars on fire. From your perspective as a former police officer who opposes police brutality, who opposes racial profiling, who opposes these murders of black people, what is the response a police officer should have when they are intentionally being violently provoked? ADAMS: It's so important. And my history - this is my life's work, dealing with police abuse, from being arrested as a young man, being told by civil rights leaders to go into the police department. I'm committed to having effective policing, but I'm also committed to something else. I'm committed to public safety. And in those cases where you see police vehicles being burned, where you see rocks being thrown, those people should be immediately apprehended and arrested. And we have to be swift about it, and we have to be - have a zero-tolerance. So that zero-tolerance of not allowing police to be abusive must also be a zero-tolerance not to allow people to attack police because that uniform is not the person in the uniform; it's the symbol of our stability. I know it has been a symbol of pain, but it also has been a symbol of the stability of this country and this city. And we need to reform it, but we can never tear down that stability that we use. So I don't go - I'm not part of that group that says disband the police departments. I'm not part of that group that says we can live in a society with no police at all. You do need some form of law and order and not unlawfulness and disorder. GROSS: Let's talk about what happened to you when you were 15 and that - how that affected your view of the police. I mean, you had been charged with trespassing. Just give us a brief sense of what the charge was. ADAMS: I was a 15-year-old child. I grew up - part of my childhood was in Bayside High School, when I left Brooklyn before returning. And my brother and I, we were arrested for criminal trespassing. Once the officers took us to the precinct - they picked us up from school, took us to the precinct. And they were filling out the paperwork, and out of nowhere, they said, you feel like a beat down? And they brought the two of us - we thought we were being transported somewhere. But they took us to the lower part of the 103rd Precinct, the same precinct Sean Bell was killed in. And they just started kicking us in the groin, you know, repeatedly. It was unbelievable. I remember acting like I passed out to get them to stop. The pain was just excruciating, if you can only imagine. And we - you know, I know I urinated blood for a week after that. And I remember every day saying to myself, Terry, that, you know, I'm going to tell my mother if it doesn't stop after the next day, the next day. And eventually, it concluded. And we never talked about that, my brother and I, until we were adults. And I think until this day, he still is suffering from mental health illness because of that because I experience PTSD. I could not see a police car go by without reliving that moment. I could not see a police show on TV. Every time I heard a siren - can you imagine just having that part of the wiring in your brain? And I think oftentimes police officers that have bad intentions do that to young people to - almost like slave masters used to do horrific things to instill fear into slaves. And it wasn't until after Randolph Evans was shot and killed that a group of leaders in Brooklyn from the Black United Front told me and 13 others to go into law enforcement. I didn't want to do that. I was a computer programmer. I wanted to open my own firm and become Cisco qualified. But I felt obligated, and it really was a life-changing experience for me, and it allowed me to turn that pain into purpose. And you know what? I finally found the refuge I needed, that I no longer felt the trauma from that beating. I felt as though that demasculation (ph) was behind me because I was using that pain in a way of turning around the lives of people. GROSS: So you're in a position of understanding the pain that a lot of black people feel when they think about the police. Were police ever a good force in your life before you became an officer? Did they ever help you or protect you? ADAMS: No. And it's unfortunate that there was always this adversarial relationship with law enforcement. And remember - you know, you don't call the police in South Jamaica, Queens, or Brownsville or East New York to invite them to a party; you call them when someone shot up the party. So when you have a relationship with an entity in your community that is only built on when there is something terribly wrong, you begin to associate pain with the profession. And so that is why proactive policing is so important in changing - how we utilize our law enforcement community is so important because I didn't have those good stories that some of my colleagues - when I attended Bayside High School and I used to hear - some of the students in the class talked about the good things they did, you know, with the police, how some of them were in the Boy Scouts or was part of the DARE program and just these interactions. And I was like, what are you talking about? They're cops. Who - (laughter) you know, who has these relationships with cops? And it was difficult because there was nothing, no point of reference of the beauty of having a good relationship with your law enforcement in your community. GROSS: My guest is Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. He now serves as Brooklyn bureau president. We'll talk more after a break. And then later, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel, the bestseller ""The Mothers,"" was optioned by Kerry Washington. And David Bianculli will review three TV shows, one from the new streaming service HBO Max. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DARRELL GRANT'S ""FILS DU SOLEIL (FOR TONY WILLIAMS)"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. At age 15, he was beaten by police. In the hope of helping reform the policing of black neighborhoods, he joined the New York City Police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been the site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. Brooklyn is also a hotspot for the pandemic. You know, I really do think there's a lot of police officers around the country who are really angry and really furious about what happened to George Floyd. And they're probably suffering too because now they're out on the streets in the middle of a pandemic fighting with people that they don't want to be in confrontation with. What do you think police can do or should do to show their anger at police who behave badly or brutally, or who are, you know, responsible for the deaths of people? ADAMS: We have to really change the culture of policing. We have police here in the city that put up a white power finger sign. And all the other police officers started cheering and laughing with them. When you have some of the actions of - we almost have to rebuild our law enforcement community because the recruitment effort we did, we focus on law enforcement, again, and not on how we deal with social issues - and build this symbiotic relationship between our policing community. And then you have to change the culture of really supporting a climate, a healthy climate, where an officer could come forward and report abuse without any form of reprisal. We must refocus and revamp police. And I think this is an opportunity to do so, as we saw in New Jersey some of the police chiefs marching with some of the demonstrators. And something else happened with the Floyd case that some people may have overlooked - it was a significant moment - one, the expeditious fashion in which the police officer was fired, second, how fast the prosecutor indicted. Now, the indictment itself is troubling to me, which is another conversation. But they moved quickly. The third - the other officers were fired. They should also be arrested. But the mere fact they were fired was a cosmic shift in policing, because the tone is now set that your actions will also - you're responsible for not only for your actions, but the actions of the person who you are near. Standing around watching someone choke to death, you should be held accountable the same way as someone participated in a robbery. They acted in concert. That is how we should treat those officers that are carrying out these actions. GROSS: I know a lot of people would agree with you that there's been, you know, progress made in how fast these actions were taken. But that doesn't seem to have had any effect on the protests. ADAMS: And it shouldn't. We have to keep the pressure on. We have a long way to go. And I am - as I stated, I'm excited about these protests because it is as though I've come full circle. I've marched in these protests when we were fighting against stop-and-frisk. I remember looking beside me and seeing these different ethnic groups who peacefully joined with me. I recall that the - in the protests, as you indicated, taking off my jeans and shirt and putting on my police uniforms and feeling as though my day was fulfilled. I felt accomplished. I felt as though I was able to protect the city and, at the same time, force them to allow our police agencies to become who and what they are. And I think these protests play a significant role, because let's face it, a absence of the Dr. Kings, the SNCCs, the Rosa Parks and so many others, America would not have moved in the area that it should have moved. We would've never signed civil rights bills. We would have never done some of the things that we did. If it wasn't for the women's suffrage movement, we would still probably not have women voting. Hitting the streets and showing you're outraged and not comfortable is something that's part of America as apple pie and Chevrolet. And we need to continue to hit the streets to move America where it ought to go. GROSS: Right now, given how hot the situation is, do you want to see people continuing to hit the streets? ADAMS: It's a very delicate balance. I'm really afraid about the COVID-19. As you know, I spent the last 50-plus days sleeping in my office from the time that COVID hit the shores here in New York City. And what we have done around this issue - and the same communities that are dealing with police abuse are the communities that were negatively impacted disproportionately by coronavirus. And so I'm afraid that many of our young people are going to take the infection home to their loved ones, their seniors, their grandmothers. And it is a true concern. And when I saw people participating in the protest, I did see some who were wearing face mask. But clearly, an overwhelming number of them were not practicing social distancing. I am concerned that, you know, body fluids, being in close proximity is going to have family members that are going to be infected. Young people who are going to leave the protests and go home, they are going to infect their loved ones. And COVID virus is serious, is real. And the same communities that are dealing with police abuse were disproportionately impacted by the lack of government response to coronavirus. GROSS: I'm obviously really worried about that, too. And, you know, Brooklyn has been a pandemic hotspot. And, you know, in Philly, Philly's preparing to reopen on Friday. Philly was preparing to go yellow. And now, like, who knows what the consequences for the pandemic will be from all the protests over the weekend? And I'm sure that's true for many cities. Like, we know what happened in New Orleans after Mardi Gras. And this was not a celebratory parade. These were protests. But it's still, in terms of the virus, it can have the same impact of thousands of people in the streets, shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of them were wearing masks. But at that close proximity, you know, who knows? How much of a setback do you fear this will be for Brooklyn, where you are the Brooklyn borough president? ADAMS: I think it's going to be a significant setback. But what I've learned - I recall after 9/11. And when the Trade Center was attacked and the buildings collapsed, I remember going out to Brownsville, a predominately black community, to talk to the young people and deal with the trauma of the buildings collapsing. And they were playing basketball and just hanging out. And I've told them, did you hear what happened? They said, Eric, we were catching hell when those buildings were up. We didn't have heat at night. We had lead paint. Crime was high. We were unemployed. Those buildings have nothing to do with us. People can feel so much pain that they become numb to the reality of danger. And I think that's what you're seeing here. Many of these young people have been living in a state of just total hopelessness and don't feel as though another level of trauma is going to do anything to dissipate the trauma that they're experiencing already. And somehow, we have to convince them that life is not about being hopeless, but about being empowered. And while we do that, we have to understand that that is why they are in the streets, not because they want to expose themselves to coronavirus. But they've reached a level of desperation where they're no longer believing society's ability to protect them from a virus or from the virus or police abuse. GROSS: Were you glad over the weekend that you are no longer a police officer? ADAMS: No, not at all. I looked forward to being in the eye of the storm. I looked forward to those difficult days when I had to talk someone down from showing a level of anger and understanding what they felt. I was the type of person that I wanted to be the platoon commander that was inside of - in charge of the detail that went out. I knew we were going to allow officers to come back safely. And I knew that the protesters were going to get home safe. And that's the type of leadership we need right now. And I think that in the police department, we have some amazing men and women who have taken upon this occupation. We need to start rewarding them for their commitment - and not only looking at how good they are at fighting crime, but how good they are at building relationships within the community.

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

Mass demonstrations have taken place across the country to call for justice for Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for help. Tensions have escalated as police officers have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, and some demonstrators have set buildings and cars on fire. Trump has faced some pressure to speak to the nation about the unrest. ""Everything's on the table,"" Rollins told Politico in a remote interview. ""I think ultimately he believes, and rightfully so, that he is in a constant narrative and conversation with his citizens."" Trump has been tweeting about the case and delivered lengthy remarks on the protests during a NASA event Saturday. He said he supports peaceful protests, but that looting will not be tolerated. Rollins, who heads the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the White House is examining a list of possible bipartisan ""solutions"" focused on how to bring the country together. ""How do we use this as a unifying force for this country?"" Rollins asked in the Politico interview. While Rollins talked about reaching across the aisle, Trump has repeatedly lashed out about the protests in partisan terms, calling out governors and mayors who are Democrats. He's urged officials to use the military to crack down on demonstrators. In a call Monday, Trump called governors weak and urged them to dominate protesters, according to a person on the line. Trump has also raised the protests as an election issue, slamming his Democratic rival Joe Biden. On Friday, Twitter placed a warning on a tweet from Trump that said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" referring to the protests. Twitter said the post ""glorified violence.""

Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

1622666440,2020-05-29 19:32:29,Protest of George Floyd’s death in downtown Troy,https://tropnews.com/protest-of-george-floyds-death-in-downtown-troy/,en,False,,592033,tropnews.com,http://tropnews.com/,"by In the wake of nationwide outrage over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, more than 50 students and community members joined in protest on the square in downtown Troy Friday. The protest lasted from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and protestors say they plan to continue demonstrating for at least another couple of days. The local protest began when Troy student Taylor Lolley, a senior psychology major from Butler, Alabama, stood alone on a downtown street corner holding a sign that read, “He Could Not Breathe.” Photos of him protesting by himself went viral on Facebook, and people began volunteering to join him for another day of peaceful action. “I watched the protest in Minnesota all night and I was so angry,” Lolley said. “I knew there was nothing going to be done here, so I decided I couldn’t just stay angry.” He said he will be back to continue the protest. Four Minneapolis police officers were fired after the incident and Friday, four days after Floyd’s death, Derek Chauvin – the officer seen in viral videos kneeling on Floyd’s neck – was arrested and charged with third-degree murder. “(The officer’s) three accomplices are still at large,” said Roberto Earl-Lynch, a sophomore global business major from Jamaica. “We’re trying to protest the wrongful murder of George Floyd. “If we don’t stand together, it’ll keep continuing to happen.” For many at the protest, their actions Friday were about much more than an innocent man dying. They said they were standing against systemic racism in the United States. “Slavery was abolished years ago, but we’re still in a situation where African-Americans are being oppressed,” said Earl-Lynch, one of the protestors on Troy’s square Friday. Brianna Hogans, a senior music major from Warner Robins, Georgia, said she was protesting not only because of Floyd’s death, but also because of the ongoing racism she sees. “It’s unfair that the police can get off with no problems,” she said. “The system is built to oppress us. “You want a system that doesn’t just benefit you, you want it to benefit everybody. There’s not a true equality, and you have to get out here and fight about it. You have to talk about it. If you’re not, you’re ignoring it.” Hogans said she wished people would have more empathy. “People of my skin complexion are looked down upon, as if we’re animals and that we don’t deserve the same respect,” she said. “It’s disheartening and frustrating to see the constant arguments on social media basically justifying his death.” Breanna Dean is from Dothan. She’s not a Troy student, but she saw a post about Lolley and his efforts on Facebook and decided to bring a friend along and join in the protest. “Systemic racism is pretty rampant in our country,” Dean said. “Silent protesting really isn’t doing much, and our voices need to be heard. “People are losing their lives unjustly. People are able to go out in broad daylight, but George, he’s dead. There’s no justice.” Tia McMillan, a Troy human services graduate from Monroeville, Alabama, agreed that people should rise up against an unfair system. “This issue is something we’ve all been saying has been going on for years — it’s nothing new. It’s something that’s finally being televised,” she said. “I will stand for what is right. “I will stand for someone who did not deserve to have their life taken.” She stressed the importance of unity, citing Biblical beliefs. “It could be someone close to you next, or it could be you next,” she said. “Why not stand up for each other?” Deizah Holland, a junior psychology major from Troy, said she’s happy to see her community standing up for something. “Growing up here, I’ve always seen people turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to social injustice, and it’s just time for me to take a stand,” she said. “How can we grow as a people if we can’t come together as one?” Cars passing by honked in support of the protestors, meeting cheers from the crowd each time. The protestors chanted “No justice, no peace!” and “What was his name? George Floyd!” together. Many passers-by in cars could be seen holding fists out their windows in solidarity. Some demonstrators brought pizza to share with others and made rounds with water so no one would become dehydrated in the near-90-degree heat. Multiple protestors who spoke with the Tropolitan said they’d be back Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. A candlelight vigil will also be held on May 31 at 7 p.m. in downtown Troy in an effort to bring awareness to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery who were all recently killed. Attendees are urged to wear a mask, and candles will be provided.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: America's police officers are at the center of a national storm. They are hearing the rage over what happened to George Floyd at the same time they've been tasked with containing the violence. Some have been accused of cracking down on legitimate protesters, others criticized for being too permissive toward vandals and looters. To give us a sense of what the nation's police officers are thinking right now, we're joined by NPR's law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste, who's been talking with his police sources today. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: First, just give us a sense of the mood of the police officers that you're talking to. KASTE: The mood is gloomy. It's tense. And I think it's fair to say that there is some fear I've heard in some of the things I've heard from especially officers who are kind of on the front lines of crowd control and scenes we've seen so much in the last couple of days. There's also kind of a sense of frustration for a lot of officers when they hear what they think - what they perceive to be sort of a note of understanding or the sense that it's acceptable that this kind of violence, this looting and arson accompany these protests - they find that kind of frustrating. SHAPIRO: Are they angry just about the violence or also about the public response condemning the Minneapolis police involved in the death of George Floyd or, in some cases, about the actions of police officers that, you know, wear the badge as well? KASTE: Well, this anger I was talking about is about this violence. To be clear, when it comes to Minneapolis cops in that video, the police - it's actually struck me how unanimous they've been in condemning - from early on, from last week - condemning what they saw in that video. I've heard cops just going off on those Minneapolis police officers, saying they've made it so much harder to be a police officer in this country now. And you know, I was talking about this yesterday with Robert Hollis, who's a police patrol commander in Kent, Wash., which is a very diverse suburb of Seattle. And he told me that as a black man, he felt sick to his stomach watching that video of Floyd. But he also saw some reason for hope in this sort of widespread condemnation he was hearing from this world of policing. ROBERT HOLLIS: Numerous unions, numerous police chiefs are coming out and saying, this is not the type of officer that we want - 'cause I guarantee you five years ago, it would be more of a, let's wait and see what's going on. Let's hold off, wait for all the facts to come out. But this time, it was outcry from the get-go. SHAPIRO: And as an African American police officer, what is his take on the protesters' accusation that the police are inherently racist, that there are unfortunate trends and, you know, that it run through the institution? KASTE: Well, I mean, he took a nuanced approach to this when we were talking about it. You know, he said that policing, by its very nature, changes slowly. But he thinks, also, that in his 19 years as an officer, he has seen substantive improvements. One example he gave is his own department. A few years ago, they still permitted that knee-to-the-neck technique that we saw used on George Floyd. But a few years ago, a trainer said, this is dangerous. And the department banned it. And he also thinks the implicit bias training of just the last few years, the last five or six years has kind of shaped the views of the new generation of leaders inside of police departments, which may be behind this sort of unanimous condemnation we're hearing. But he still said that he understands that when people see something like this case with George Floyd, that they say, if one of you did it, you all did it. HOLLIS: I don't blame them. At the same time, I still would say to those community members, you need to keep working with us, and we want to keep - continue to keep working with you because we recognize that there's a need to change. We're doing our best to try and make those changes. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Martin, as somebody who's been covering these issues since before Ferguson, do you see the same kind of gradual improvement that Commander Hollis is describing? KASTE: There have definitely been policy changes. There's been sort of a change in attitude in departments on how use of force is used and documented. But you know, policing is a patchwork in this country. There's some talk now about changing the rules under which police can be sued. SHAPIRO: OK.

1622671514,2020-06-01 16:30:00,Hong Kong Police Block Tiananmen Square Vigil Due To Coronavirus,https://www.apr.org/post/hong-kong-police-block-tiananmen-square-vigil-due-coronavirus,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"For the first time in 30 years, police in Hong Kong have denied permission for organizers to hold an annual vigil for victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

1622671483,2020-06-01 16:59:00,"From Jobs To Homeownership, Protests Put Spotlight On Economic Divide",https://www.apr.org/post/jobs-homeownership-protests-put-spotlight-economic-divide,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET Wednesday The death of a black man at the hands of a white police officer has sparked days of civil unrest in the United States. Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Mayor Randall Woodfin made the declarations today during a nearly hour-long virtual news conference in the wake of protesters on Sunday night damaging downtown businesses and attacking reporters. “What started out with the best intentions turned into something that none of us deserve, none of our small business owners, none of our corporate community, the people in the media that were physically hurt, no one deserved what happened last night in this city we call home,” Woodfin said. “I want you to know that I 100 percent support civil disobedience, but that is very different from civil unrest, and I support activism and the right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs or people destroying things just because.” The citywide curfew will be implemented until further notice and last from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily, the mayor said. Travel on city streets will be limited with the exception of medical and essential personnel. Employees will need to provide a form or document to prove they need to work during the curfew hours. On Sunday, 24 people were arrested, 14 businesses were burglarized and 13 other businesses suffered significant damage, city officials said. Birmingham Fire and Rescue responded to 22 fire calls, five of which were commercial, the city said. Two members of the media were attacked, but no other injuries were reported at this time. The decision to declare a state of emergency came after city leaders determined lives were potentially at risk. Woodfin said. “We decided to declare it last night and announce it today. … What we’re seeing across the nation are a lot of people engaging in civil unrest and we need to make sure our citizens know in advance and (that there will be a) curfew,” he said. “The city of Birmingham is open to the additional resources as it relates to squashing civil unrest; we have no problem partnering with Alabama Law Enforcement Agency or the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office to assist us … to protect our citizens, first responders and to protect people’s property.” Like other leaders in the state, Gov. Kay Ivey said she was disappointed to see the chaos. Ivey issued a statement saying, “The Alabama National Guard stands ready to assist when peaceful protests become violent and dangerous to our public safety. I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. “Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night,” she said in the statement. “What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated. State assets are available to any local government that makes the request. We will show respect to ourselves and to each other through this process.” Workers put up plywood at the Wheelhouse and the Shutter Shop in Birmingham after widows were broken during a protest Sunday evening.

(Marvin Gentry/The Birmingham Times) Following peaceful gatherings Sunday, protesters gathered in Birmingham’s Linn Park later in the evening and tried to remove Confederate statues. Birmingham police officers moved into the park, asking the crowd to disperse. Some left, but others began to destroy business property downtown along 19th and 20th Streets and Fifth Avenue North. Alabama Power was among the businesses damaged. “There was damage to the Alabama Power headquarters building as the result of recent protests which occurred overnight,” a statement from the company said. “While it’s unfortunate, it pales in comparison to the hurt, pain and concern faced by so many in our community and across the nation. Buildings can be replaced, but lives cannot. We must come together – business, communities and individuals alike – to fight against injustice and encourage and promote unity.” The mayor said he was disappointed at the way the entire episode transpired. “This is not who we are,” he said. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform and anybody that is doing the looting and breaking things and setting fires just because, you are not doing that in the name of George Floyd.” Birmingham Police Chief Patrick D. Smith said the world is waking up to see a very different Birmingham, “one that is hard to watch or take in,” he said. “What started out as a peaceful protest turned into something different. It is our intent as a police department to follow up on every single crime, we will look for and collect every video … and we need your (the public’s) help. It is our goal to make sure we find those responsible, whether you were a part or incited the riot, and it does not matter who you are or what position you hold, the department will follow up.” Woodfin said he intends to remove the large Confederate monument in Linn Park even though it will mean a $25,000 fine for the city. The cost of removing it is less than the continual costs of civil unrest if it remains, he said. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said the one-time fine is the only punishment the city faces if it removes the monument. “The Alabama Monuments Preservation Act provides a singular avenue for enforcement — the filing of a civil complaint in pursuit of a fine, which the Alabama Supreme Court has determined to be a one-time assessment of $25,000. The act authorizes no additional relief,” Marshall said. “Should the city of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today, city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the act to pursue a new civil complaint against the city.” Bessemer has also declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. for the next five days. Bessemer Mayor Kenneth Gulley cited “credible threats” against the city on social media as the reason for the protective measure. Anyone with videos or images of those who caused unrest or violence in Birmingham on Sunday is encouraged to call Crimestoppers at 205-254-7777 and share what they have.

The city of Bessemer is now under a state of emergency. The curfew will last from June 1 to June 5 from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. Bessemer Police Chief Michael Roper also supported the mayor’s decision in implementing a city curfew. “We will not tolerate anyone coming into Bessemer to burn buildings, burn cars or any of that foolishness,” Chief Roper said. “That is not the way you need to honor Mr. Floyd.” Bessemer city officials are aware of threats made against the city of riots, looting and destructive protests and law enforcement and the city government are preparing for what’s to come in the next week. Mayor Gulley reiterated that peaceful protest is good, but the public should not engage in unlawful activities. LATEST HEADLINES",0.0

Some of them have remained peaceful, while others have escalated. Over the weekend in Huntsville, peace remained at the center of the protests, but Lt. Michael Johnson with the Huntsville Police Department says they are prepared for anything. “If a protest does turn violent – and we would not like to think that protesters themselves are violent, it’s actually those that infiltrate protest situations – we do have a team of officers, along with general patrol, that know how to react to these situations,” said Lt. Johnson. He adds that the officers’ plan for each situation constantly changes. “We do tweak our plans literally on the move,” Lt. Johnson said. “Whether it’s an increase in possible officer presence or increase in contingency plans for things that happen.” The department commends the protests over the weekend for having no violence and no property damage, unlike other cities in the state. “I think everyone walked away with more sense of security for our city and more sense of resolve for how law enforcement is going to continue moving forward… healing and mending these wounds that we’re seeing across the country,” said Lt. Johnson. While it is the job of police officers to maintain peace in the city, Lt. Johnson says they are also focused on protecting the rights of protesters to make sure they’re voices are heard. “First and foremost, that is absolutely what we actually plan for, is protecting those that are trying to express their first amendment rights,” he said. “It’s something fundamental across the country. It’s something that we know historically has been protected here with our police department. And the Huntsville Police Department plans to keep it that way.

Trump posted identical messages on Twitter and Facebook this week. But while the two social platforms have very similar policies on voter misinformation and glorifying violence, they dealt with Trump’s posts very differently, proof that Silicon Valley is far from a united front when it comes to political decisions. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden Monday evening after deriding many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke at the White House as a large group of protesters demonstrated outside ahead of a citywide curfew. Just before Trump was scheduled to speak, police fired tear gas and deployed flash bangs to disperse the protesters, who appeared to have been demonstrating peacefully. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. LATEST STORIES",0.0

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

1622719474,2020-06-01 19:01:00,USC Professor On How Protests Have Changed Since LA Riots In 1992,https://www.apr.org/post/usc-professor-how-protests-have-changed-la-riots-1992,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Looting, fires, vandalism and the National Guard on the streets — for many, the unrest of 2020 evokes memories of the destructive riots of 1992 in Los Angeles. Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

1622725653,2020-05-31 23:48:34,Pastor Chris Hodges responds to social media controversy,https://www.al.com/news/2020/05/pastor-chris-hodges-responds-to-social-media-controversy.html,en,False,,658852,Birmingham News as it Happens from Birmingham News.Net,http://www.birminghamnews.net/,"The pastor of Alabama’s largest church has come under fire for following and liking social media posts by Charlie Kirk, president of the conservative non-profit Turning Point USA, a high school and college campus organization often controversial for its political stances. A Birmingham high school English teacher did a post on Facebook pointing out that Pastor Chris Hodges, founder of the Church of the Highlands, repeatedly “liked” social media posts by Kirk. “I do not attend Church of the Highlands,” said Jasmine Faith Clisby, who teaches English at Carver High School, has a degree in English from the University of Alabama, a master’s degree in education from UAB and is working on a doctorate in education at UAB. “I would be upset if it comes off as me judging him,” she said. “It’s not that. I’m not saying he’s a racist. I’m saying he likes someone who post things that do not seem culturally sensitive to me.” She said she found it objectionable and noteworthy that Hodges followed Kirk on social media. “One of the main things Kirk harps on is white privilege being a myth,” Clisby said. “I found something troubling,"" Clisby said. ""I can’t see into Pastor Chris Hodges’ heart.” One meme shared by Kirk featured a photo of Donald Trump standing alongside Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks, with the caption, “The racist Donald Trump in the 1980s,” next to a photo of Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in a photo of two men wearing blackface and a KKK costume in a 1984 yearbook photo for Eastern Virginia Medical School. The caption for the second photo was “Progressive Leftist Ralph Northam in the 1980s.” Clisby also shared a screen shot of that post with Hodges as one of those who “liked” the post on social media. Another screen shot showed Hodges liking a post about former President Barack Obama playing golf beneath a quote from Michelle Obama urging people to stay home except for essential activities. Another screen shot shows Hodges liking a photo of Kirk donating blood above the sentence, “We all must do our part to defeat China Virus.” Hodges, who has been active in the Evangelicals for Trump Coalition, addressed racism in his online sermon Sunday morning and mentioned the social media post. “White supremacy or any supremacy other than Christ, is of the devil,” Hodges said. “Some have even brought our church or even me into question. They’re wondering, where do you really stand? I think some saw something on social media that questioned my character. And, I’ll own it, by the way, but that is not what I believe.” Hodges devoted much of his morning sermon on Sunday and a prayer service on Saturday morning to discussing racism. “It has been an incredibly tough season for our nation,” Hodges said Sunday. “Not only the coronavirus, which has tensions at their highest, but of course the racial injustices we’re experiencing,” he said. “On Monday, once again, an unarmed black man died needlessly, as a police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck,"" Hodges said. ""I know with each new incident, with this one, Ahmaud Arbery, I think of Atatiana Jefferson, it’s disgraceful that racism, injustice, bigotry, prejudice, still even exists at all. I want you to know that I believe it makes God angry and it makes us angry too. I know we need to do something. We need to pray. We need to be the church. But Proverbs 31 says to speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Ensure justice for those who are being crushed. Think of that verse. Speak up for the poor and the helpless. Be sure that they get justice. I know our nation needs healing. It needs change. There’s many things that need to take place, beyond just prayer. I think prayer is probably the most important, personally I believe that. But I recognize a lot needs to be done. But as the Bible teaches, as Jesus teaches, as Dr. King taught so beautifully, that hatred cannot drive out hatred, violence doesn’t heal violence. It’s okay to be angry about an unfair system, injustices, but Romans 12:21 says don’t be overcome by that evil, overcome the evil with good. And I recognize that we need to speak up. People have asked, is Highlands going to say anything? I feel like we have, but I will make sure today. If that has not been clear to you, I’m going to make sure today that racism, bigotry, prejudice are real, they exist, and they are of the devil. “It is not what we teach,"" Hodges said. ""I understand how this has made you feel and I apologize. Honestly, it’s understandable to me. I don’t take it personally. I know people are hurting right now and they want clarity. I would love for you to not just look at a microscopic zoom-in but look at the totality of 37 years of ministry and 19 years as a church. If you look at that it will be abundantly clear that we value every person. For every person that has been marginalized, rejected or belittled, abused or even afraid because of how God made you, Tammy and I, the Church of the Highlands family, stand with you.” Hodges added, “We will never stop fighting for liberty and justice for all. I love you. I’m sorry for perhaps the way you feel. I beg for us to come together in unity under the name of Jesus. And I really believe that God will heal our land.” Clisby said she listened to Hodges’ sermon on Sunday and his reference to the social media. “He admitted to it; he owns up to it,” she said. “He says he doesn’t believe that.” Clisby said she was making a point about cultural sensitivity. “With the racial unrest going on in our country, awareness is important in things that spark up tough conversations,” she said. “He more than likely is a great man. When we come from different backgrounds, it’s hard for those worlds to intertwine. We don’t talk about things that are hard to discuss.” While majority white, the Church of the Highlands draws thousands of black worshippers, including at two inner-city Birmingham congregations, meeting at Woodlawn High School and at Parker High School in west Birmingham. Former Auburn University football player Mayo Sowell, who is black, is the campus pastor at the Parker High School location and preaches the sermons there. At more than 20 other branch locations across the state, sermons by Hodges were shown on video as part of in-person worship services before shutting down as a precaution against the coronavirus. For the past 12 weeks, the Church of the Highlands has held online worship services without Sunday morning in-person group gatherings. Hodges has discussed bringing back Sunday in-person worship services by June 21, although no final determination has been made. On Tuesday, June 2, Hodges sent out the following apology: I want to talk to you from my heart. The first thing that I want to do is apologize. I’m sorry. As a pastor and, more importantly, as a follower of Jesus, I work to consider every action carefully, weigh every word, and be respectful of every person and opinion, as Christ taught. I realize that I have hurt people that I love deeply because I “liked” multiple insensitive social media posts. Each one was a mistake. I own it. I’m sorry. I’ve learned so much in the past few days about racial disparities in America. I wish I could sit down and have a conversation with everyone impacted or hurt by my actions. I have realized I can’t thoughtlessly scroll through social media and click ""like"" on a post while not fully understanding all that post represents. After taking the time to review and reflect, I can tell you those social media posts that I ""liked"" do not reflect, in any way, my true feelings or beliefs. I now realize they were hurtful and divisive, and I sincerely apologize. I own my mistakes and ask forgiveness from those I have offended. Please know that I have learned, and will continue to learn, so much from this. Over the last 20 years, our church and I have fought for the disenfranchised, marginalized, and hurting of ALL races in our community. But this week, I’ve learned that even with 20 years of loving and serving people, it’s still possible to have a blind spot that you just didn’t know was there. I realize it is my responsibility to have more conversations to become better aware of the pain and the hurt, and to understand ALL people better. As painful as this has been for many of you, it has opened my eyes to something that I just didn't fully understand. Not because I didn't want to, but because I didn't realize I didn’t see it, and comprehend it like I should. Through conversations this week where I just listened, I am learning more about unconscious bias and privilege. I have always had the privilege of never being followed around a store because of the color of my skin. That's a privilege I didn't even realize I had. I've never had to sit down with my kids and teach them the beauty of their skin color because someone at their school had devalued them merely because of it. I can tell you this: With revelation comes responsibility. I have the responsibility of learning new thoughts and new points of view. Conversations I wish I had engaged in years ago will now shape who I will be in the years to come. Soon, I will be holding forums at our church to hear from Highlands members of all races, to share their experiences and heart. I am determined to listen, learn, and be a part of the solution. I understand my influence, not only in our church locally, but as a voice to many churches globally. I take my responsibilities very seriously. I love you so much, and I’m deeply sorry that I hurt you. I have spent my lifetime loving and pouring into people, and moving forward, I will prove to you that even at 56 years old, you can still learn, you can get better, you can make changes and love people more deeply. I’m committed to that. I can promise you one thing: As a pastor, I will continuously do my best to lead you to Jesus, and I will also teach you, by my actions, what it looks like to need Him. This won't be the last mistake that I make or the last bit of mercy I will need. I need God's compassion and your mercy. All of us need God’s grace and mercy in this season, and I’m asking you to help me, help us, get better. Let’s all learn more, pray more, love better, and stand stronger so that we can see His Kingdom come, His will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. With love, Pastor Chris",0.0

The event was held at Kelly Ingram Park, site of the Children’s Crusade, a turning point in the Civil Rights movement 57 years ago. This story was initially published about the peaceful rally on Sunday afternoon. The story is developing. The rally, called “Birmingham, the World is Watching,” was coordinated by the Mayor’s Office of Social Justice and Racial Equity and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. “Birmingham, the World is Watching” Rally, May 31, 2020. Photo by Kristina O’Quinn The nearly two-hour rally included foot soldiers from the 1963 Children’s Crusade, local ministers, students, representatives from a multitude of faiths, community leaders and public officials. Despite public pleas calling for peaceful protests by both Mayor Randall Woodfin and Senator Doug Jones, the Confederate Monument in Linn Park was vandalized around 7:30pm. The Charles Linn statue, also in Linn Park was taken down this evening by protesters. When we published this story at 10:45pm, Here are some of the comments from the rally: Mayor Randall Woodfin. Photo by Kristina O’Quinn “Follow the blueprint that Birmingham has established. Lift your voices. Fight forcefully. Fight peacefully. Strategize. Organize. See the world through the eyes of neighbors, even if you can’t walk in or understand their pain. Lock arms and be the support they need as we travel this walk and world together. Realize the enemy is not each other. What we fight together is injustice. This is not a time for lawlessness.” ~ Mayor Randall Woodfin. Alabama Senator Doug Jones. Photo by Kristina O’Quinn “That’s what we’ve seen the last six days since George Floyd was killed. We’ve seen the smoldering of racism. We’ve seen the voices that are not being heard. Voices that are crying out for the same opportunities for everyone in America. The voices are going unanswered. We face challenges folks. Dangers and fears that are not simply days old, but have existed for centuries.” ~ Alabama Senator Doug Jones “My great grandfather was lynched about 20 minutes from here in 1892. From recent events in 2020, I cannot help but look at a modern-day lynching. It’s 2020, right. We in Birmingham, we wrote the playbook on this, our history serves as a beacon for how peaceful protest can bring about positive change.” ~ Joi Brown, Birmingham Civil Rights Institute  Foot Soldier Gwendolyn Webb. Photo by Kristina O’Quinn “I’m here to tell you freedom ain’t free. We paid a price. You will pay a price…..we did a peaceful protest, when dogs were after us. When men were after us with dogs and billy clubs…we can do all things through Christ.” ~Rev.

Later, the protest turned violent as demonstrators turned and attacked several members of the media, including from AL.com. At least one TV reporter was struck in the head with a bottle. The monument withstood attempts to bring it down before Birmingham’s mayor asked the crowd to leave before police were to step in. The Thomas Jefferson statue at the Jefferson County Courthouse, adjacent to the park, was damaged about 10 p.m. after someone set a fire at its base and several windows in the courthouse were broken by rocks thrown in the demonstration. Police moved into the park minutes later and demonstrators moved a block south of the park on 6th Avenue North at 20th Street North where they burned a flag on a pole at the Wells Fargo building. Demonstrators also spray painted windows and broke out windows in the ground floor of the skyscraper where some entered the building. Windows were also broken out of the neighboring Harbert Plaza as the protesters continued marching south. Demonstrators also broke out windows at the Alabama Power building at 18th Street and 6th Avenue North and entered the building. At 1:40 a.m. Monday, firefighters and police were putting out a fire in the California Fashion Mall store at 1901 3rd Ave N. There were several other businesses along Third Avenue that had windows smashed. [Video here]. Protestors gather in front of the Confederate monument at Linn Park. Posted by al.com on Sunday, May 31, 2020 The effort began after a speaker at a rally for George Floyd on Sunday afternoon called for its removal. Comedian Jermaine “FunnyMaine” Johnson, called for demonstrators to tear down the monument. “We’ve got a lot cities around the country. They’re tearing down Target. They’re tearing down city hall. We can’t do that. We gotta protect our city,"" Johnson said. “We can’t tear down 16th Street Baptist Church. We can’t tear down the civil rights museum. We can’t tear down Carver. We can’t tear down A.G. Gaston Plaza. But what I’m not telling you to do is walk to Linn Park. I’m not telling to walk to Linn Park after this rally. I’m not telling you to tear something down in Linn Park. I’m not telling you that I’m going to be over there after this rally,” he said. Birmingham protestors say they will tear down a Confederate monument in Linn Park. Posted by al.com on Sunday, May 31, 2020 The monument in Linn Park has been the subject of a legal fight between Birmingham and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office over historical monuments. The City of Birmingham has wanted it removed, but has lost a legal fight with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. It wasn’t the first legal fight over the monument. Save Our South filed a lawsuit a month after the Birmingham Park and Recreation Board unanimously approved a resolution in July 2015 to remove the Confederate Soldiers & Sailors monument. At first protesters on Sunday took down a plywood barricade at the base of the monument, placed there by the city before the legal fight. Then demonstrators began to chip away at the monument with anything they could find. Ropes were then placed around the monument in an attempt to bring the large monument down. Demonstrators also spray painted the base and chipped away at the inscriptions at the bottom. Chains or ropes were also placed around the monument and people were trying to pull the monolith down. A pickup truck also was being used to help pull. The rope broke on the first attempt. Birmingham police officers stood by watching the protesters and did not attempt to stop them. Officers later pulled back further from the scene. Protesters also turned their attention - and were successful - in taking down a metal statue of the park’s namesake. Protesters then chanted “one more to go,"" referring to the main granite Confederate monument. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin appeared at the park, and using a bullhorn next to Johnson, asked the crowd to stand down. The crowd was angered at the request. “I understand the frustration and the anger that you have,” he said. “Allow me to finish the job for you.” The mayor didn’t explain how he would finish the job. Birmingham, this is not the road to reform. Do not destroy the community you worked to build. pic.twitter.com/yDgW9JBdqF — Randall Woodfin (@randallwoodfin) June 1, 2020 Woodfin said if the crowd continued police would move in. He said he didn’t want anyone in the crowd to get arrested. Johnson said that Woodfin was asking for 24 hours and that the mayor deserves to get that time. If the monument isn’t down by Tuesday Johnson said he would be back out. The protesters have been a part of demonstrations and rallies around Alabama and the nation over the death of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck until he couldn’t breathe. > Police shoot pepper balls at Mobile activists as peaceful protest turns violent > Here is the earlier reporting from this afternoon telling of protests around the state",0.0
1622734364,2020-06-01 19:20:26,"Birmingham business owners, volunteers clean up after destructive protests",https://www.cbs42.com/top-stories/birmingham-business-owners-volunteers-clean-up-after-destructive-protests/,en,False,,115203,wiat.com,http://wiat.com/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) — Birmingham business owners are cleaning up after destructive protests Sunday night in the downtown area. A fire broke out at the California Fashion Mall, where there is also plenty of other damage to the doors and windows of the store. Shattered glass remains scattered across the concrete. “When I come here and saw it catch fire and I just prayed,” said David Kim, who has owned the business for about 35 years. Kim, who is Korean-American, was moved to see so many volunteers helping him clean Monday morning. He estimated he lost about $200,000 worth of merchandise. “Around me, there are many good people, but today I realize again that I am a lucky man to live in America,” said Kim. Several other businesses also sustained damage, including restaurants, bank buildings, and abandoned properties. At Adams Eye Care, owner Juanakee Adams has seen a lot of unrest in her 40 years as a Birmingham eye doctor. “God blessed and enabled me to be the first black female to practice optometry in the state of Alabama,” Adams said. Despite the damage to her shop, Adams said she will press on. She wants those doing damage to understand that lives are impacted by destructive protests. “I’m hoping that they’ll see that this is a face behind it. This is not just an empty building,” said Adams. While Adams is against violence, she understands the concern of the protesters. She thinks damaging property is counter-productive. “It was heartbreaking and for no rhyme or reason and I am sympathetic to their plight, but this is not a remedy. This just creates another problem,” said Adams. Volunteers came from all over the Birmingham area Monday to help. “We’ve got a broom. We’ve got a dust pan,” said Jacob Irvin. Irvin also supports the right to protest, but was surprised to see the violence that has played out in other cities. “When you see it in your own town it really hits you in the heart a lot more,” said Irvin. The cleanup will take plenty of time, but shop owners are thankful they’re not picking up the pieces alone. “I’m just teared up. Teared up. I couldn’t believe it,” said Kim. For any demonstrators who might be considering another round of destructive protests, business owners like Adams ask that you reconsider. “Please look at me. Look at my colleagues, look at my neighbors and don’t do this to anybody else,” said Adams. In addition to volunteers, Birmingham native and Comedy Central’s Roy Wood Jr. was also helping Adams clean up her shop. She was overwhelmed at the support from the community.",0.0

HOOVER Due to protests, the Mayor of the City of Hoover announces a 7 p.m. curfew effective tonight, June 1. The city of Hoover has experienced protests within the past 48 hours that have resulted in 45 arrests for both felony and misdemeanor charges. Damage to private property has also occurred from these activities. Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato issued a statement in a press release: It is my determination that a state of emergency exists due to the civil unrest and destruction occurring on the nights of May 30 and May 31, 2020, in the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area; and there is a continuing threat of further rioting that has taken over otherwise peaceful protests in many cities across the United States. Such civil unrest threatens the lives, safety, health and welfare and the property of the people of the City. For this reason, the City of Hoover will implement a curfew effective tonight at 7:00 pm.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

1622738478,2020-06-01 16:59:00,"From Jobs To Homeownership, Protests Put Spotlight On Economic Divide",https://www.wvasfm.org/post/jobs-homeownership-protests-put-spotlight-economic-divide,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET Wednesday The death of a black man at the hands of a white police officer has sparked days of civil unrest in the United States. Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. “We have the greatest country in the world,” Trump declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. LATEST STORIES",0.0

HOOVER Due to protests, the Mayor of the City of Hoover announces a 7 p.m. curfew effective tonight, June 1. The city of Hoover has experienced protests within the past 48 hours that have resulted in 45 arrests for both felony and misdemeanor charges. Damage to private property has also occurred from these activities. Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato issued a statement in a press release: It is my determination that a state of emergency exists due to the civil unrest and destruction occurring on the nights of May 30 and May 31, 2020, in the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area; and there is a continuing threat of further rioting that has taken over otherwise peaceful protests in many cities across the United States. Such civil unrest threatens the lives, safety, health and welfare and the property of the people of the City. For this reason, the City of Hoover will implement a curfew effective tonight at 7:00 pm. Mayor Brocato, City of Hoover Mayor Brocato also says although there will be certain permitted travel in the city, the intent of this action is to protect Hoover residents, visitors, and businesses from harm or loss and to allow the Hoover Police Department to focus on the actions needed to provide protection.

The mayor said that unrest that followed the peaceful protest, including breaking storefront windows, violence and theft, was not done in memory of Floyd and does not represent the values of Birmingham. Violent protestors damaged property in downtown Birmingham and in certain parts of the city on May 31. 24 people were arrested, 13 businesses were damaged and 14 businesses were burglarized last night. Police expect to receive more reports of damages today, according to BPD Chief Patrick Smith.

Mayor Randall Woodfin appealed for calm in a city known for civil rights demonstrations that turned violent when segregationist officials used dogs and fire hoses on protesters in the 1960s. ""Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest. Violence, bullying and chaos is not the road to reform,"" Woodfin told a news conference while announcing efforts to quell the mayhem of a few hours earlier. A city-wide curfew will begin at 7 p.m. nightly, he said. Woodfin requested assistance from state police, an aide said, but he didn't immediately accept Gov. Kay Ivey's offer of National Guard troops. Hundreds of people gathered peacefully in a downtown park, chanting and listening to speakers decrying police brutality, on Sunday before night fell. Some in the crowd toppled a bronze statue of city industrialist Charles Linn, who served in the Confederate Navy, but they couldn't budge a huge stone obelisk honoring the Confederacy, instead battering it with stones and hammers. Video showed crowds then moved into commercial areas, and police said more than two dozen businesses were looted or damaged. Two dozen people were arrested, Woodfin said, and two members of the media were injured in attacks. The following morning, Wheelhouse Salon owner Johnny Grimes cleaned up smashed windows and determined how much of his computer equipment had been stolen by looters. The business had just been cleared to reopen after being shut down for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Grimes said he was frustrated by the destruction but sympathizes with demonstrators. ""I hope that this isn't all for nothing. I hope that this does spark some type of national conversation on race, racial reconciliation, police brutality and how the African American, black community is treated in America,"" said Grimes, who is white. Protests have erupted around the country to protest the death of Floyd, an African American man, on May 25. Floyd was on the ground and handcuffed when a white police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Woodfin said the city will try to take down the strong Confederate monument but will see if it can be given to a museum or other group. He said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments, is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. Both peaceful protests and confrontations between police and demonstrations also occurred in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover and Mobile, where media outlets reported that police used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds. Gov. Kay Ivey said state assistance was available to any city that asks. ""What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is,"" she said in a statement. ""Going forward, this cannot be tolerated."" The Birmingham mayor made a plea for peace, saying civil disobedience wasn't the same as civil unrest. ""Birmingham the world is watching,"" Woodfin said. Monday was a state holiday in Alabama for the birthday of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. ___ Chandler reported from Montgomery.",0.0

Smith, who was last year convicted of manslaughter in the shooting death of Greg Gunn, a black Montgomery man who was killed just steps away from his home. Though Smith was convicted and sentenced to serve 14 years in prison, the presiding judge granted the former officer an appeals bond, allowing him to walk free on bond while his appeal makes it way through the courts. Johnson on Monday said the appeals bond is a privilege rarely afforded black people. ""There are people who have done far less than what Aaron did, and they're in prison awaiting appeal. ... They say 'Trust the process.' But the process doesn't work for us, it works for them,"" Johnson said. ""Faith without works is dead. We don't hear what you say, we see what you do. We're tired of coming to the table and leaving with a promissory note that isn't fulfilled. No more. What we want is equality. What we want is justice."" Johnson said he's calling for all city and community leaders to stand in solidarity with their peaceful protests, and he wants to see Smith's appeals bond rescinded: ""That is the first outward expression they can do."" The pastor said he doesn't support any of the violence or property damage seen in some protest clashes across the country, but he understands the hurt and pain protesters carry with him, and he doesn't property damage is equitable to a life lost. ""You can fix property, you can't bring Greg Gunn back,"" Johnson said. After Reed spoke, several protesters in the Nixon crowd approached him in the crowd. Ja'mel Brown, a community activist who helped organize a Saturday protest, said ""When we had our protest, we were peaceful. We didn't tear down nothing, we didn't stop nothing,"" Brown told Reed.

Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham says officers are trained to de-escalate civil unrest without using force and in a situation like this, some people just need to vent, and officers are subject to peoples’ frustrations. “It’s not you, but you’re the first person they see in that uniform and that’s who they want to take it out on.

1622778877,2020-06-01 21:36:00,"Hoover mayor declares state of emergency, enacts curfew",https://hooversun.com/news/h_2/,en,False,,287964,hooversun.com,http://hooversun.com/,"× Expand Photo by Jon Anderson 200531_Hoover_protest_JA02 Hoover police officers keep watch over a protest that involved up to 400 protesters at the corner of U.S. 31 and Municipal Drive in Hoover, Alabama, on Sunday, May 31, 2020. The protesters claim there is a pattern of unfair treatment of people, especially minorities, by police in the United States. Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato tonight declared a state of emergency in the city and implemented a curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. Brocato said the curfew is needed due to the civil unrest that has taken place in the Birmingham-Hoover metro area in the past three days and threats of further violence and to protect residents, visitors and businesses from harm or losses. It also will allow the Hoover Police Department to focus on actions needed to provide such protection, the mayor said. The curfew prohibits people from traveling on roads in Hoover between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., except to: Obtain medical assistance, food or other necessary commodities or services for themselves or their family members Return home or to their job Attend church, school or organized sports and events, including weddings and funerals Travel from one location outside of the city to another location outside of the city Because of the state of emergency and the civil unrest and destruction that occurred on Saturday and Sunday nights, the mayor also has prohibited demonstrations, marches, parades or vigils on public rights of way or other public property during the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. The curfew does not affect the rights of businesses to operate and does not apply to law enforcement officers, firefighters, public employees, doctors, nurses, employees of hospitals and medical facilities, on-duty military and employees of public utilities, public transportation companies and media. Violation of the curfew is an arrestable offense, and offenders found guilty are subject to a fine of up to $500 or up to six months in jail. The curfew will remain in effect until either the mayor or City Council determines it is no longer needed. Hoover police Chief Nick Derzis said that while most of the protesting that has occurred in Hoover in the past few days has been peaceful, there have been some issues. Police had bottles of water, bottles of urine and eggs thrown at them during protests, and one police officer was injured in one of the protests, Derzis said. Two retail stores — the Jared jewelry store and Von Maur department store on the Riverchase Galleria campus— had glass doors and/or windows smashed Saturday night. Police have made 45 arrests in conjunction with the protests, mostly for disorderly conduct. Further, there have been continued threats of violence that have many residents concerned, Derzis said. He 100% agrees that a curfew is needed to help keep the city safe, he said. He also thinks the hours should mirror the hours of the curfew that Birmingham implemented because if Hoover doesn’t have a curfew during those same hours, it increases the likelihood that trouble will find its way to Hoover, he said. Brocato said people in Hoover are shocked and saddened at the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week and the manner in which it occurred, and the implications of that has had far-reaching impacts on cities throughout the country. Brocato said he wants to seek justice and bring peace and safety to all citizens, regardless of their race, creed or national origin, and he stands in full support of citizens who want to express their First Amendment right to peacefully demonstrate and protest. However, city officials must protect individuals and businesses from “senseless destruction by criminal mob actions.” Birmingham experienced significant rioting and vandalism in its downtown area Sunday night, and at least two news reporters were assaulted. The civil unrest threatens the life, safety, health, welfare and property of people in the city of Hoover, he said. The Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency, on behalf of Jefferson County Commission President Jimmie Stephens and the mayors of Hoover, Homewood, Mountain Brook and Vestavia Hills today sought assistance from the National Guard to help keep the peace. Gov. Kay Ivey earlier today authorized the National Guard to activate up to 1,000 guardsmen should the need arise to respond to violent protesters, and the city of Birmingham is seeking help from the Alabama State Troopers, Jefferson County EMA Director Jim Coker said. Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato and Councilman John Greene both tonight commended the Hoover Police Department for the way officers have handled the protests in recent days. ""The performance of the Police Department has been above and beyond the call of duty,"" Brocato said. ""They've just done an incredible job.""

He never thought he'd get a chance to fight back, let alone make it out alive. But on Monday, Soltan, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen now living in Virginia, used a federal statute to accuse former Egyptian prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi of crimes against humanity. The 1991 Torture Victims Protection Act allows for victims of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by foreign officials abroad to seek justice through the American court system. It's the first such case against an Egyptian official, made possible by the grim coincidence that el-Beblawi now lives just miles from Soltan, in Washington, where he is an executive director of the International Monetary Fund. 'He's completely gotten away with it, and is walking free downtown,' Soltan said. 'I just want to regain some of the justice and dignity stripped away from me.' El-Beblawi, contacted through the IMF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the summer of 2013, after the military-led ouster of the country's first democratically elected but divisive president, Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian security officers descended on a protest camp packed with his Islamist supporters, killing hundreds. Soltan, an Ohio State graduate and the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was shot in the arm while working as a stringer for Western news organizations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Before long he was picked up by security forces. In a mass trial widely condemned by human rights groups, Soltan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of spreading 'fake news"" to tarnish Egypt's image. In the maximum-security Tora prison complex, Soltan says he endured unspeakable torments overseen by el-Beblawi and other high-ranking officers. He says he was denied medical care for his festering bullet wound, beaten to unconsciousness, held in solitary confinement and forced to listen to the sounds of his father being tortured in a nearby cell. He lost 160 pounds over the course of a 16-month hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. Under pressure from the Obama administration, Egypt released Soltan in 2015, although his father remains in prison. He has attempted to build a new life in Virginia, advocating for fellow political prisoners still in Egypt and pursuing a master's degree at Georgetown University. But memories from his dark cell in Tora still haunt him. 'There's this perpetual, compounded trauma every single day,' he said, 'where you get up and look in the mirror and see the scars and cigarette burns and the bullet marks...it changes you.' Eric Lewis, a lawyer with Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, who represents Soltan, says he hopes the case sends a message to Egypt's government 'that they cannot commit crimes against humanity and then seek haven in the United States.' An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in Egypt's jails, according to Human Rights Watch, including many journalists and critics held on vague terrorism charges without trial. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who came to power in 2013, has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent. The lawsuit lists el-Sissi, intelligence chief Abbas Kamel and three other former senior security officials as culpable, saying that they can be served if they set foot in the United States.",0.0

At least eight people were arrested from the area of Linn Park, where a Confederate monument stands. The Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument stands 52-feet tall and was gifted to the city in 1905, by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Mayor Randall Woodfin put a curfew into place following riots that began with a protest at the park Sunday. Protesters attempted to take down the monument Sunday and Mayor Woodfin said he would have the statue removed within 24 hours. Protesters left Linn Park and rioted throughout the city setting fires, breaking glass in buildings and looting.

Marshall said the act provides no additional relief. “Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today, city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City,” Marshall continued.

Mayor Randall Woodfin appealed for calm in a city known for civil rights demonstrations that turned violent in the 1960s when segregationist officials used dogs and fire hoses on protesters. “Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest. Violence, bullying, and chaos is not the road to reform,” Woodfin told a news conference while announcing efforts to quell the mayhem from hours earlier. A city-wide curfew will begin at 7 p.m. nightly, he said, and several nearby suburbs imposed similar rules. Woodfin requested assistance from state police, an aide said, but he didn’t immediately accept Gov. Kay Ivey’s offer of National Guard troops. Hundreds of people gathered peacefully in a downtown park, chanting and listening to speakers decrying police brutality, on Sunday before night fell. Some in the crowd toppled a bronze statue of city industrialist Charles Linn, who served in the Confederate Navy, but they couldn’t budge a huge stone obelisk honoring the Confederacy, instead of battering it with stones and hammers.

We spoke with one of the protestors from yesterday’s march who said she was proud of the unity in her city until things too a turn for the worse when protestors started to gather on the I-10 ramp in front of officers. Sabrina Mass said she felt like she needed to step in and tell everyone to stand down, she said “I took it appon myself to say no, this is not going to happen. Stop envoking them to try and cause harm to you, so back up and I meant that.. back up away from them. It wasn’t called for..” Mass gave a passionate speech before the peaceful march began and said she didn’t want things to go south, her and many others just wanted peace. She says they stand in solidarity in feeling that unruly protests and disprespect to police like what was seen Sunday night on Aiport Blvd. is not the answer. We sat down with Mobile Police chief Lawrence Battiste on Monday and he agreed with Mass, saying this type of behavior won’t stand in Mobile. “They can take their ideologies and approach to creating chaos and the idea that they want to riot and loot is not something that is acceptable here in our community and we will do everything we can to prevent it.” said Battiste.

Huntsville Police Chief Mark McMurray said they made it safe for protesters to be in the area because several people had brought weapons to the demonstration. Those people were arrested. Chief McMurray said that the event was peaceful, but was supposed to be over at 6 p.m. Madison County Sheriff Kevin Turner ordered everyone to leave the area. McMurray said most of the original event organizers left the area but as far as he could tell, a “residual crowd of out-of-towners” remained. Chief McMurray says the NAACP is sponsoring another event later in the week and authorities have invited everyone back on Wednesday to participate peacefully. Chief McMurray said after asking people to leave they began making demands and authorities had to push the crowd down the street. Authorities released a smoke canister to “keep people moving”. Chief McMurray said when the crowd stopped moving and became confrontational again, they released a second canister with smoke that “was a little bit stronger, it had a taste of CS in it. As you can see my eyes are watering, my throat is choked up. I enjoyed the same thing that they enjoyed for a few minutes of uncomfortableness.” McMurray said that there could be a few troublemakers who want to break windows, but officers were tracking those groups.

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much.

""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen.

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, 'Don't shoot."" Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. 'I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military 'and quickly solve the problem for them.' As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. 'As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. 'We are putting everybody on warning.' Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place.' Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates "" something he had never done before "" and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John's Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. 'We have a great country,' Trump said. 'Greatest country in the world.' He didn't talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary "" all white "" to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. 'We're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. 'Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice "" right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area "" is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president's complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.' And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John's belongs, said she was 'outraged' by the moment and noted that Trump didn't pray during his visit. 'He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,' Budde told The Associated Press. 'There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.'",0.0

(AP) "" Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city's police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video. 'This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,' Fischer said. 'Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.' Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. 'This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,' the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an 'honest and transparent way that will not take months.' U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine 'the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.' Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. 'I've never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,' he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. 'Over the years he's been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,"" he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several 'persons of interest' were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant "" 'just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue' "" when the soldiers arrived. 'As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,"" Smith said. 'It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.' He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. ___ Associated Press contributors include Claire Galofaro and Rebecca Reynolds Yonker in Louisville.

Mayor Randall Woodfin appealed for calm in a city known for civil rights demonstrations that turned violent when segregationist officials used dogs and fire hoses on protesters in the 1960s. ""Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest. Violence, bullying and chaos is not the road to reform,"" Woodfin told a news conference while announcing efforts to quell the mayhem of a few hours earlier. A city-wide curfew will begin at 7 p.m. nightly, he said. Woodfin requested assistance from state police, an aide said, but he didn't immediately accept Gov. Kay Ivey's offer of National Guard troops. Hundreds of people gathered peacefully in a downtown park, chanting and listening to speakers decrying police brutality, on Sunday before night fell. Some in the crowd toppled a bronze statue of city industrialist Charles Linn, who served in the Confederate Navy, but they couldn't budge a huge stone obelisk honoring the Confederacy, instead battering it with stones and hammers. Video showed crowds then moved into commercial areas, and police said more than two dozen businesses were looted or damaged. Two dozen people were arrested, Woodfin said, and two members of the media were injured in attacks. The following morning, Wheelhouse Salon owner Johnny Grimes cleaned up smashed windows and determined how much of his computer equipment had been stolen by looters. The business had just been cleared to reopen after being shut down for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Grimes said he was frustrated by the destruction but sympathizes with demonstrators. ""I hope that this isn't all for nothing. I hope that this does spark some type of national conversation on race, racial reconciliation, police brutality and how the African American, black community is treated in America,"" said Grimes, who is white. Protests have erupted around the country to protest the death of Floyd, an African American man, on May 25. Floyd was on the ground and handcuffed when a white police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Woodfin said the city will try to take down the strong Confederate monument but will see if it can be given to a museum or other group. He said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments, is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. Both peaceful protests and confrontations between police and demonstrations also occurred in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover and Mobile, where media outlets reported that police used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds. Gov. Kay Ivey said state assistance was available to any city that asks. ""What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is,"" she said in a statement. ""Going forward, this cannot be tolerated."" The Birmingham mayor made a plea for peace, saying civil disobedience wasn't the same as civil unrest. ""Birmingham the world is watching,"" Woodfin said. Monday was a state holiday in Alabama for the birthday of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. ___ Chandler reported from Montgomery.",0.0

(AP) "" Several Democratic governors on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump's threat to deploy the U.S. military unless they dispatch National Guard units to 'dominate the streets' in reaction to the violence that has erupted across the country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an 'incendiary moment' by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 'I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors 'weak' and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that 'we can use at any moment.' 'I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays 'no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.' 'This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is 'misinformed.' ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.' In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. 'You don't defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,' Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. 'Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.' She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments 'noise' and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0
1623066166,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Sports Figures Add Their Voices To Those Of Angry Protesters,https://www.apr.org/post/sports-figures-add-their-voices-those-angry-protesters,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Sports are part of the fabric of American society, and often they've provided a medium for athlete protest. In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000.

Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List.

It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans.

They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite.

(WKRN) —- On Monday, hundreds joined forces for a peaceful protest at the Tennessee state capitol, voicing their anger with the death of George Floyd. Organizer and refugee, Kayo Beshir, told News 2 that their goal is to achieve change in peaceful way. He referenced the riots that took place in Nashville on Saturday night, as a distraction to the peaceful message that was shared during the ‘I will Breathe’ rally earlier on the same day. During Monday’s demonstration, the crowd sang hymnals, chanted and called for action against what they called, unjust policing. Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence.” said Russell Pointer Jr. a pastor. Activist and Reverend, Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up the barrier tape allowing protesters to pass through. Once at the top of the capitol, protestors asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions, a divine occurrence, “it was a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields, because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful. We are here to bring peace and change.”",0.0

Late Sunday evening protesters in downtown began trying to tear down a Confederate monument and damaged a number of buildings and businesses. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin appeared on the scene and asked the crowd to leave before police stepped in. The Thomas Jefferson statue at the Jefferson County Courthouse, adjacent to the park, was damaged about 10 p.m. after someone set a fire at its base and several windows in the courthouse were broken by rocks thrown in the demonstration, according to AL.com. Reporters at local media outlets also posted videos and other content showing attacks on journalists. Those incidents marred what was otherwise a peaceful weekend of demonstrations in the city although at least 20 people were arrested in Hoover during demonstrations there. In Birmingham on Saturday, State Rep. Neil Rafferty (D-54) said to a large group of demonstrators, “Today is about the people whose grievances go unheard, whose lives are marred by the injustices in our society which manifests in sudden violent forms through the pull of a trigger or a knee to the neck. “But [which] also persists in slower more insidious forms for instructional violence seen in our healthcare disparities, inequitable school funding, the war on drugs targeting black bodies and the lack of access to safe, affordable housing and lack of opportunity,” he added. Over the weekend, Woodfin, Jefferson County Sheriff Mark Pettway, Jefferson County Commissioner Sheila Tyson and former mayor William Bell were among the nearly 1,000 people who gathered downtown to protest the killing of Floyd and call for justice. Before the mayhem ensued on Sunday evening, Woodfin called Birmingham the “blueprint” for a nation divided by race, adding “the enemy is not each other . . . To say that we as a people are not better off today than we were 50 years ago … that dismisses the sacrifices of the foot soldiers that join us today. On Saturday, Bell said, “Each time that we encounter a police officer no matter what the situation, our mind has to go into a different mode, our mind automatically goes into a survival mode.” 1 of 55 Pettway said he’s putting measures in place to ensure that what happened to Floyd does not happen locally. It starts with the hiring process, and a check of social media sites to see what type of groups the officers are associated with, and deputies are also taught how to de-escalate situations, he said. “We’re not stopping until…we get what is called justice,” Pettway said. Tyson on Saturday encouraged the attendees to vote for the people who are going to address the issues in our communities, because “our mothers [and] our grandmothers are tired. We’re tired of burying our children.” “This is a state of emergency, it’s not going to end,” Tyson said. “We have to stand and band together…we have to go and vote in numbers, we have to make sure we get everybody out to this poll; show them what we can do with our vote. Burning things up is nothing …but when you vote somebody out, they’re going to catch hell getting back in. That’s where the power is.” Civil Rights activist and attorney Faya Toure said blacks need to understand the power they can wield. “We believe we’re inferior, we believe we’re not as smart, not as pretty. Until we kill that myth…we have to remember who we are, and when our children know who they are, it’s all over. “I want you to turn your rage into organization…I want you to turn your pain into inspiration and passion. I want you to turn your presence here into solidarity…because it’s not just this one beautiful black man,” Toure said.

1623125083,2020-06-01 17:42:37,"Mayor Declares State of Emergency, Curfew in Birmingham",http://www.birminghamtimes.com/2020/06/mayor-declares-state-of-emergency-curfew-in-birmingham/,en,False,,104308,The Birmingham Times,http://www.birminghamtimes.com,"By Erica Wright The Birmingham Times What began as a peaceful demonstration Sunday afternoon in Birmingham to protest the death of George Floyd, a man killed by a Minneapolis police officer last week, led to a state of emergency for the city and a mandatory curfew beginning tonight. Mayor Randall Woodfin made the declarations Monday during a nearly hour-long virtual press conference in the wake of protesters on Sunday night damaging downtown businesses and attacking reporters. “What started out with the best intentions turned into something that none of us deserve, none of our small business owners, none of our corporate community, the people in the media that were physically hurt, no one deserved what happened last night in this city we call home,” Woodfin said. “I want you to know that I 100 percent support civil disobedience, but that is very different from civil unrest and I support activism and the right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs or people destroying things just because.” The citywide curfew will be implemented until further notice and last from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily, the mayor said. Travel on city streets will be limited with the exception of medial and essential personnel. Employees will need to provide a form or document to prove they need to work during the curfew hours. On Sunday, 24 people were arrested, 14 businesses burglarized, 12 businesses with significant damage and 22 fire calls to Birmingham Fire and Rescue responded, five of which were commercial, the city said. Two members of the media were assaulted, but no other injuries were reported at this time. The decision to declare a state of emergency came after city leaders determined lives were potentially at risk. Woodfin said. “We decided to declare it [state of emergency] last night and announce it today . . . what we’re seeing across the nation are a lot of people engaging in civil unrest and we need to make sure our citizens know in advance and [that there will be a] curfew,” he said. “The city of Birmingham is open to the additional resources as it relates to squashing civil unrest, we have no problem partnering with Alabama Law Enforcement Agency [ALEA] or the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office to assist us . . . to protect our citizens, first responders and to protect people’s property.” Meanwhile, Governor Kay Ivey issued a statement saying “The Alabama National Guard stands ready to assist when peaceful protests become violent and dangerous to our public safety. I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point.” Like other leaders in the state, the governor said she was disappointed to see the chaos. “Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night,” she said in a statement. “. . . we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated. State assets are available to any local government that makes the request. We will show respect to ourselves and to each other through this process.” Following peaceful gatherings on Sunday, protestors gathered in Birmingham’s Linn Park later in the evening and tried to remove Confederate statues. Birmingham police officers moved into the park, asking the crowd to disperse. Some of those individuals left but others began to destroy businesses in downtown along 19th and 20th Streets and 5th Avenue North. The mayor said he was disappointed at the way the entire episode transpired. “This is not who we are,” he said. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform and anybody that is doing the looting and breaking things and setting fires just because, you are not doing that in the name of George Floyd.” Birmingham Police Chief Patrick D. Smith said the world is waking up to see a very different Birmingham, “one that is hard to watch or take in,” he said. “What started out as a peaceful protest turned into something different. It is our intent as a police department to follow up on every single crime, we will look for and collect every video . . . and we need your [the public’s] help, it is our goal to make sure we find those responsible, whether you were a part or incited the riot and it does not matter who you are or what position you hold, the department will follow up.” Anyone with videos or images of those who caused unrest, violence on Sunday is encouraged to call Crimestoppers at 205-254-7777 and share what they have.

1623142547,2020-06-02 05:57:00,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.apr.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623142540,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.apr.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0

David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville.

(WDHN) — Protesters gathered in front of the Houston County Courthouse Sunday to protest after the death of George Floyd. With riots around the nation and anger directed towards law enforcement there was some concern how Dothan Police would react, and they said they were proud. “All in all they did a great job with it,” Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish said. “They did it the way it was supposed to be done and I’m very proud of them. I’m proud of the citizens that we have in our area that attended that did a good job.” Chief Parrish said that Dothan Police go through extensive background checks and psychological assessments before someone can become an officer. Parrish said bad apples in the police force won’t last. “Administrators have to be very conscious of what their people are doing, what they’re saying,” Parrish said. “I think accountability and transparency are key components in building a good solid workforce. A workforce that is community oriented. A workforce that is flexible.” Community relationship with police took a hit after what happened in Minnesota. Dothan Police have made bridging the gap programs and community outreach programs in the past to build a strong relationship with the community. “You got to practice what you preach you can’t just talk about it,” Parrish said. “You have to have development of hands-on with your community in non-police type situations.”",0.0

Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste tied Bond to the weekend protests in Mobile and said, while he supports the right to protest, it doesn’t include destroying property or harming people. The chief, who is black, was asked he had any sympathy for Bond for defacing what some see as a monument to slavery and oppression. “My job is to stand in the gap for law and order regardless of how I feel personally about any of this here, I take my job seriously and I serve all the people of the city of Mobile,” said Battiste.

Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0

Protesters lined the streets in front of Saki Melius’ restaurant, Menya Ramen & Poke. “I respect and support the peaceful protest,” said Melius, saying she shares in their outrage over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. But when nightfall covered the city of Denver, the protests turned violent. “Today I’m alone because my employees are afraid to come in,” Melius said. Agitators shattered her windows and set her dumpster on fire. She was forced to close her restaurant for two months due to coronavirus, and now this damage is another setback. Melius lined her windows with messages pleading for her restaurant to be left alone. The messages read: “Please don’t destroy our restaurant” and “Minority owned business.” “Being a minority, we are working so hard. We want to make it through this and after the COVID.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. NOEL KING, HOST: Last night, President Trump made a threat. He said if states don't figure out a way to stop unrest, he will send in the military. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. KING: NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman has been looking into this. Good morning, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: The president sometimes just says stuff. But this is a serious thing that he said last night. Do we know if and when he might really do it? BOWMAN: No, we don't. And, as you say, you know, he'll say all sorts of things. This appears to be more bluster on the part of the president, quite frankly, and trying to score political points. He's been very critical of the governors, especially democratic ones, saying they're weak, not doing enough to deal with the protests that have gone violent. But the governors are calling out their National Guard in large degree. Twenty-three states are using their Guard for a total of 17,000 Guard troops, and more may be called up to deal with any lawlessness. And the Guard troops are assisting local law enforcement in everything from transportation, logistics and in the more traditional law enforcement activities like partnering with police on patrols. But again, this is all at the state level with no federal involvement at this point. KING: Right, which raises this really interesting question. Does President Trump actually have the authority to deploy troops other places? BOWMAN: He does have that authority under the Insurrection Act from the early 1800s, which basically says a president can send in active-duty troops into a state if the laws are not being enforced, including the civil rights of residents. Now, Eisenhower did it in the 1950s in Arkansas to enforce school desegregation against the wishes of state officials. But the last time, Noel, the Insurrection Act was used was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots that followed Rodney King's beating. But that was when Governor Pete Wilson requested federal troops from President George H.W. Bush. So it almost always makes sense to have the support of local officials. And in Washington, D.C., the leaders there have requested more National Guard troops from out of state. And those Guard troops started coming in late last night. And there are some active-duty military police on standby now outside the city. But we're told by Pentagon officials they most likely will not be needed because of those additional Guard troops, as well as federal law enforcement officials. KING: So those pictures we saw out of D.C. last night, those were all National Guard? BOWMAN: Right, National Guard, D.C. National Guard, as well as, again, a lot of federal law enforcement personnel as well. Now, D.C. has called up its entire 1,200 National Guard contingent, which is, again, why officials say they need more Guard troops. And again, those additional Guard troops - hundreds of them - started coming in late last night from a number of states, including New York and New Jersey. KING: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Noel. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1623318532,2020-06-02 09:43:00,Watch Live: Biden To Condemn Trump's Protest Response In Speech,https://www.apr.org/post/watch-live-biden-condemn-trumps-protest-response-speech,en,False,,109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Updated at 11:46 a.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden condemned both police violence and President Trump's increasingly confrontational response to widespread unrest in a Tuesday morning speech delivered at Philadelphia City Hall. ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph, 69. ""It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago."" Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving."" In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. ""The things that we were fighting for in the '60s aren't solved yet,"" said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. ""We shouldn't be treated the way they treat us."" ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.",0.0

Demonstrators began assembling shortly after 8:00 p.m., and though tensions sometimes flared verbally, no physical altercations or property damage occurred. At the end of the night, one young woman who refused to leave the scene of the protest after the city’s COVID-19 imposed 10:00 p.m. curfew was arrested by the Montgomery Police Department. She was the only demonstrator arrested in downtown Montgomery on Monday, though the police department also took suspects into custody for the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue at Lee High School a few miles away.  Demonstrations had been held in Alabama’s capital city on Saturday and Sunday during the daylight hours, but Monday was the first gathering since an outbreak of violence in Birmingham ratcheted up tensions in the Yellowhammer State. Mayor Steven Reed held a press conference at 6:00 p.m. and urged all those willing who could to stay home for the next few nights. Various protesters tacitly acknowledged the violence in Birmingham and other cities across the country as they urged those assembled throughout the night to “stay calm” and “stay peaceful.” “If you’re an agitator, you don’t belong here,” said one woman when the crowd had swelled. There was evidence during the night that indicated the City of Montgomery was prepared for a more unruly evening than what occurred. A few dozen police officers were at the scene of the protest, but on the adjoining streets several more officers were close by that could have served as backup if needed. Businesses nearby had prepared for bad behavior. The Montgomery Police Department erected barriers one block away from the capitol in each direction, and the lines drawn by the officers were never broken by the demonstrators. Protesters began marching and chanting familiar nationwide slogans such as “black lives matter” and “Say his name — George Floyd” to begin their demonstration Monday night. Yellowhammer News walked amidst the protesters and was able to observe myriad levels of anger, disagreement about tactics and positive reassurance of the mission at hand for those assembled. Dozens of those assembled were documenting the event for social media, while others held signs and led the crowd in chants. There were even moments of levity, such as when one young woman demanded to know who of the protesting men were single, because she liked what she was seeing. Tensions were highest just after 9:00 p.m., when the crowd was at its largest and moved suddenly into close contact with the police standing behind a barricade.

Another demonstrator asked the rhetorical question, “Do you know how wars are won?” He then answered his own question, “By f—–g sacrifice.” That demonstrator was then engaged in a respectful conversation by Montgomery Police Chief Ernest Finley, Jr., who was standing at the front lines of the protest.

After what appeared to be a long discussion with multiple officers, he appeared to leave the protest without being taken into custody. An officer confirmed to Yellowhammer News later in the night that the man had not been arrested. The removal of that man ended the most contentious portion of the evening. The crowd size began to diminish afterward, and there were only around 100 protesters remaining when the mandatory 10:00 p.m. curfew went into effect. Just after the curfew, there appeared to be some energy among those remaining to stay until the voice of an Alabama State University student named Talisa Boswell rose above the din of the crowd. “We’ll be back tomorrow,” Boswell promised as she urged her fellow demonstrators to obey the orders to disperse. The crowd appeared to take Boswell’s message to heart as the vast majority of protesters left the scene. One lone resisting woman was handcuffed and taken away by police at 10:15 p.m., and the department later confirmed to Yellowhammer that she had been arrested.

1623348918,2020-06-02 10:11:03,WATCH: Biden to hit Trump as more focused on ‘power than principle’; speaks about civil unrest,https://www.cbs42.com/top-stories/live-biden-to-hit-trump-as-more-focused-on-power-than-principle-speaks-about-civil-unrest/,en,True,,115203,wiat.com,http://wiat.com/,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joe Biden plans to blister President Donald Trump for directing authorities to drive back peaceful protesters outside the White House “in order to stage a photo op,” saying Tuesday that the commander in chief “is more interested in power than in principle.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is delivering a speech in Philadelphia, addressing “the civil unrest facing communities across America.” Biden is working to elevate his voice in the national debate after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronarvius. “When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released by his campaign. “More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care.” Biden’s criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation’s governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality in the wake of the George Floyd killing that have roiled the nation. Police under federal command eventually forced b ack peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. “Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either,” Biden plans to say. “But I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate.” The former vice president is set to appear at City Hall in Philadelphia, where the National Guard is maintaining a visible presence to defend public buildings as the city grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, is expected. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the “president of law and order.” Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,” Biden will say, according to the excerpts. “I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me.”",0.0

The statue was the target of protests Sunday night following peaceful weekend protests in the city after last week’s killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Shortly before 8 p.m. on Monday, a large crane arrived in Linn Park — with the city nearly vacant after Mayor Randall Woodfin earlier in the day imposed a mandatory 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew — to remove the 115-year old monument that had caused a years-long battle between state lawmakers and leaders in Alabama’s largest city. The Alabama Supreme Court last year ruled that Birmingham violated Alabama’s monument protection law when it placed a plywood screen around the Confederate monument in August 2017, and ordered the city to pay a $25,000 fine. The plywood was placed there on orders of former Birmingham Mayor William Bell after the state passed the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act in 2017 in response to calls for removal of Confederate monuments on public property. Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit against Birmingham. However, Marshall on Monday appeared to de-escalate the situation by saying the city would get a one-time $25,000 fine for removing the monument. “Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had [Monday], city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the city,” Marshall said. However, “In the aftermath of [Sunday] night’s violent outbreak, I have offered the City of Birmingham the support and resources of my office to restore peace to the city.” Woodfin told AL.com that he was willing to pay the fine to have the statue removed. “In order to prevent more civil unrest, it is very imperative that we remove this statue,” he said. “I understand the A.G.’s office can bring a civil suit against the city, and if there’s a judgment rendered from a judge then we should be held accountable, and I am willing to accept that because that is a lower cost than civil unrest in our city.” On Sunday in Birmingham, 24 people were arrested, 14 businesses burglarized, 12 businesses sustained significant damage and 22 fire calls to which Birmingham Fire and Rescue responded, five of which were commercial, the city said. The citywide curfew will be implemented until further notice, the mayor said. “What started out with the best intentions turned into something that none of us deserve, none of our small business owners, none of our corporate community, the people in the media that were physically hurt, no one deserved what happened last night in this city we call home,” Woodfin said. “I want you to know that I 100 percent support civil disobedience, but that is very different from civil unrest and I support activism and the right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs or people destroying things just because.” Share this: Print Google Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Reddit WhatsApp ",0.0

Robert E. Lee that stood in front of the namesake school, the Montgomery Public School district announced it had been moved to storage. News of the statue came during a protest on Dexter Avenue where hundreds of people decried the excessive use of force against George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was killed after a now former officer knelton his neck for over eight minutes. More: Activists urge officials to drop charges against 4 arrested for toppling Lee High statue After the statue was removed from its pedestal, it was righted and then taken from the scene. Jeremy Selmar, Jonathan Williams, Joe Pernell and Maya Holley were each charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony. According to state law, a person commits the crime of first-degree criminal mischief if damages to property exceed $2,500. The statue was overturned on a state holiday commemorating Jefferson Davis' birthday. It is one of three Alabama holidays celebrating the Confederacy, a government that rested on the principle of white supremacy. City spokesman Griffith Waller said the statue was recovered by Montgomery police. Any decisions made about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, Waller said. Protesters Monday night voiced strong opinions about Confederate memorials and statues. ""Montgomery full of slave trophies,” one man said, before saying the memorials ""had to come down."" The statue was unveiled in 1908 and placed at the corner of Madison Terrace and Winona Avenue. Later it was moved closer to Ann Street along Madison Avenue before moving to the school in 1960, five years after the then all-white school was opened. In all three locations, the statue has faced north, according to the school's site. ""Tradition says that the general would never turn his back to the possibility of approaching enemies from the North,"" it states. More: 'Nothing but racism:' Senate delays monuments vote after senator invokes Alabama's shameful past It is unclear what the future of the statue is, because the city, county and school district lacks the power to remove it. Alabama's Memorial Preservation Act, passed in 2017, prevents the renaming or removal of monuments and buildings more than 40 years old without legislative approval. According to 'Echoes' of Robert E. Lee High School, a book written in part by former MPS Superintendent Clinton Carter, the school has spent thousands over the years repairing the statue due to vandalism. ""Recent estimates to replicate and replace the statue range from $45,00 in copper and bronze to $25,000 in aluminum,"" the book, published in 2015, states.

1623356909,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Sports Figures Add Their Voices To Those Of Angry Protesters,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/sports-figures-add-their-voices-those-angry-protesters,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Sports are part of the fabric of American society, and often they've provided a medium for athlete protest. In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said Rita Hart is an Iowa state senator. She is a former Iowa state senator. Copyright 2020 NPR.

1623356897,2020-06-02 05:57:00,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be.

1623358535,2020-06-02 11:09:59,"LIVE: US cities erupt in more violence amid threats from Trump; Sharpton, Reps. push to ban police chokeholds",https://www.cbs42.com/top-stories/live-us-cities-erupt-in-more-violence-amid-threats-from-trump-sharpton-reps-push-to-ban-police-chokeholds/,en,True,,115203,wiat.com,http://wiat.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0
1623356891,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.wvasfm.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's homicide at the hands of Minneapolis police, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In The Boston Review, Elizabeth Stinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place over half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.'"" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Michael Dessam compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annelisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community—police brutality and the coronavirus—aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases the extent of the death toll stems from systematic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines a 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American Dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago—only to close her doors due to COVID-19. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to re-open this weekend—that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for George Floyd and change for Minneapolis. ""'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.'"" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangaldeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police.

Robert E. Lee that stood in front of the namesake school, the Montgomery Public School district announced it had been moved to storage. News of the statue came during a protest on Dexter Avenue where hundreds of people decried the excessive use of force against George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was killed after a now former officer knelton his neck for over eight minutes. More: Activists urge officials to drop charges against 4 arrested for toppling Lee High statue After the statue was removed from its pedestal, it was righted and then taken from the scene. Jeremy Selmar, Jonathan Williams, Joe Pernell and Maya Holley were each charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony. According to state law, a person commits the crime of first-degree criminal mischief if damages to property exceed $2,500. The statue was overturned on a state holiday commemorating Jefferson Davis' birthday. It is one of three Alabama holidays celebrating the Confederacy, a government that rested on the principle of white supremacy. City spokesman Griffith Waller said the statue was recovered by Montgomery police. Any decisions made about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, Waller said. Protesters Monday night voiced strong opinions about Confederate memorials and statues. ""Montgomery full of slave trophies,” one man said, before saying the memorials ""had to come down."" The statue was unveiled in 1908 and placed at the corner of Madison Terrace and Winona Avenue. Later it was moved closer to Ann Street along Madison Avenue before moving to the school in 1960, five years after the then all-white school was opened. In all three locations, the statue has faced north, according to the school's site. ""Tradition says that the general would never turn his back to the possibility of approaching enemies from the North,"" it states. More: 'Nothing but racism:' Senate delays monuments vote after senator invokes Alabama's shameful past It is unclear what the future of the statue is, because the city, county and school district lacks the power to remove it. Alabama's Memorial Preservation Act, passed in 2017, prevents the renaming or removal of monuments and buildings more than 40 years old without legislative approval. According to 'Echoes' of Robert E. Lee High School, a book written in part by former MPS Superintendent Clinton Carter, the school has spent thousands over the years repairing the statue due to vandalism. ""Recent estimates to replicate and replace the statue range from $45,00 in copper and bronze to $25,000 in aluminum,"" the book, published in 2015, states.

"" Retired admiral ""sickened"" by use of National Guard against protesters. "" Thousands of protesters mass across the street from Lafayette Park near the White House. "" Los Angeles police have arrested more than 2,700 during protests. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said Tuesday that she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father who would never get to see his daughter grow up. 'I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,' Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. 'I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.' Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ SEATTLE "" Seattle's police watchdog agency said Tuesday it is investigating the use of pepper spray to break up a fourth consecutive day of large protests over the George Floyd killing, a tactic that drew questions from some city leaders. The protest Monday was largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade near a police station, but citizen video posted on Reddit and Facebook showed that the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Other officers nearby then began spraying chemicals and firing flash-bangs. Seattle's Office of Police Accountability said it has received about 12,000 complaints over the Seattle Police Department's handling of the demonstrations and looting. ___ WASHINGTON "" Thousands of protesters are massing across the street from Lafayette Park near the White House on Tuesday, as military and civilian law enforcement personnel stood on the other side of a black chain link fence that had been put up overnight to block access to the park. The crowd chanted the name of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. Floyd is the black man who died while in police custody in Minnesota. The protesters stood in front of the historic church where President Donald Trump went for a photo op Monday night after the area around Lafayette Park was cleared of protesters by law enforcement officials using smoke canisters and pepper balls. A half dozen Episcopal priests stood outside St. John's Church handing out bottled water and praying with protesters. ___ WASHINGTON "" A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was 'sickened' to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a 'stunt,' Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump's 'disdain' for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to enable him to use the active duty military to perform law enforcement duties to quell protests. Mullen said that as bad as conditions on the streets of some cities have become, the crisis does not now justify invoking the Insurrection Act. ___ MIAMI "" A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted 'No justice, no peace, no racist police' as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of 'police brutality' are also common in Florida. 'It happens everywhere,' Auberry said. 'I just pray for the hearts of the wicked to be changed. If their hearts don't change, it's the same cycle over and over again.' ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. "" The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would 'start firing live rounds' at protesters and 'see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.' Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state's National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others 'who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.' Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn't a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. "" About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon's demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, 'they're waiting on us to give up, they're waiting on us to get tired, they're waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.' A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON -- Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said 'What's his name?' and the crowd replied, 'George Floyd.' The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation's second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department's civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS "" Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO -- Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd's death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to 'stay home and stay off the streets' a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday's chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. "" Citing George Floyd's death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's death. The state says it will investigate the department's policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in 'systemic' discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state's human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of 'I can't breathe' until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON "" Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn't been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use 'typical crowd control measures' against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he'll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation's capital Monday night as a 'show of force' against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named 'Operation Themis.' In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. -- Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0

Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reeforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0
1623399524,2020-06-02 10:40:00,"Russian-American Masha Gessen Sees Putin In Trump, Trouble In Future",https://www.wvasfm.org/post/russian-american-masha-gessen-sees-putin-trump-trouble-future,en,False,"politics and government, books and literature, economic conditions and trends",144085,wvasfm.org,http://wvasfm.org/,"Americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life. All of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy. Gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory. ""He may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation,"" Gessen writes, a climate of ""more anxiety and fear of change."" Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability ""while at the same time dangling the promise of stability."" In uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin. For many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets. Gessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of ""an imaginary past."" Gessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran ""not for president but for autocrat,"" and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future. Born in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history. Brought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office. Gessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs. Gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a ""mafia state,"" ruled by a crime family in which ""one man distributes money and power to all other members."" (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation. Gessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power. ""The first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding,"" Gessen writes. ""Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics."" Gessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven ""weak"" because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be ""the magic bullet"" that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing ""in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories."" Since 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College. Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple — The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker. Gessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions — for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next. Gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words ""immigrant"" and ""refugee"" (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as ""migrant"" or ""invasion."" Gessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled ""The Power Lie,"" Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may ""collapse in the face of facts"" and ""the Trumpian lie."" The latter is ""the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' "" The media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations ""fact-check"" the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued. Gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all. But getting back to the word ""surviving"" and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this: ""Recovery from Trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be."" At this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by ""we."" One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office. Gessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans. In a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called ""the forgotten man and the forgotten woman,"" the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades. What if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts — the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.

James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm.

Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0
1623404797,2020-06-02 10:40:00,"Russian-American Masha Gessen Sees Putin In Trump, Trouble In Future",https://www.apr.org/post/russian-american-masha-gessen-sees-putin-trump-trouble-future,en,False,"politics and government, books and literature, economic conditions and trends",109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"Americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life. All of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy. Gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory. ""He may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation,"" Gessen writes, a climate of ""more anxiety and fear of change."" Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability ""while at the same time dangling the promise of stability."" In uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin. For many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets. Gessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of ""an imaginary past."" Gessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran ""not for president but for autocrat,"" and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future. Born in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history. Brought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office. Gessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs. Gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a ""mafia state,"" ruled by a crime family in which ""one man distributes money and power to all other members."" (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation. Gessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power. ""The first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding,"" Gessen writes. ""Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics."" Gessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven ""weak"" because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be ""the magic bullet"" that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing ""in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories."" Since 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College. Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple — The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker. Gessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions — for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next. Gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words ""immigrant"" and ""refugee"" (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as ""migrant"" or ""invasion."" Gessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled ""The Power Lie,"" Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may ""collapse in the face of facts"" and ""the Trumpian lie."" The latter is ""the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' "" The media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations ""fact-check"" the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued. Gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all. But getting back to the word ""surviving"" and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this: ""Recovery from Trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be."" At this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by ""we."" One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office. Gessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans. In a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called ""the forgotten man and the forgotten woman,"" the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades. What if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts — the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose.

'He thinks division helps him,' the presumptive Democratic nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall. 'This narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being.' Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible before nearby St. John's Church. 'If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using 'tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' Biden's address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for two-plus months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump every day "" and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden delivered the remarks as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd's death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the 'tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.' 'The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. 'I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are?' he said. 'Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?' The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a 'consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he said his anguish over the death of his son Beau Biden five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. 'Like many of you, I know what it's like to grieve,' Biden said. 'I know what it feels like when you're thinking you can't go on.' He said 'bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly' and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. He called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using choke holds. Biden also promised to increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic, should he win the presidency. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it 'is crying out for leadership.' 'This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,' Biden said, adding that Trump is 'consumed with his blinding ego.' Biden also offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted before Biden spoke that Washington 'had no problems last night' and cited 'many arrests,' as well as 'overwhelming force' and 'Domination' for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a 'president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech 'obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.' 'President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,' she said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. 'I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. 'Nobody will get it right every time and I won't either,"" Biden said. But he vowed not to 'traffic in fear and division."" 'I won't fan the flames of hate,' he said.

A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph, 69. ""It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago."" Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving."" In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. ""The things that we were fighting for in the '60s aren't solved yet,"" said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. ""We shouldn't be treated the way they treat us."" ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.",0.0

I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

Police say 13 people were arrested on charges from disorderly conduct to arson. However, the computer system is down at the jail right now, so it’s not possible to see who those people are or where they are from. Those arrests were not during the daylight march, which was mostly peaceful, but during more chaotic protests Sunday night. The council is asking Mobile residents not to fall in with those “outsiders.” “we urge our citizens to stay home and stay safe and not fall prey to these efforts to cloud an important conversation. Let us instead focus on solutions to the issues this tragedy brought to light.” Mobile City Council Statement Police are still looking for a woman who used a baseball bat to smash the window of a patrol vehicle.

Alabama would be well-served to have him back as our United States Senator. During the first two years of the Trump administration, I saw Senator Sessions’ commitment to the president’s agenda first-hand as one of his deputies, in charge of the nomination and confirmation of federal judges. The day after Neil Gorsuch was nominated to the Supreme Court, I was one of the first people Justice Gorsuch met with, laying out the path we would take to his confirmation. While Democrats and the press were slandering his good name, I was in a room with Brett Kavanaugh, preparing him to defend his honor against one of the worst smear campaigns this country has ever seen. Senator Sessions was with us every step of the way, and his commitment went beyond the Supreme Court battles that garner most of the headlines. When it came to getting federal judges confirmed, there was no resource we needed that he didn’t make available to us, never any concern we had that wasn’t addressed. No one who worked for him had any question that Senator Sessions understood the importance of confirming judges to the bench who understand the limited role of the judiciary, who believed that words matter, and who would interpret statutes and the Constitution according to the text rather than their own beliefs or desires. And now President Trump hasn’t only confirmed more judges at this point in his administration than any president in history, he’s confirmed better, more conservative judges than any president before him. But it wasn’t just judges where Jeff Sessions played an instrumental role in the success of this president. On illegal immigration, fighting crime, restoring respect for the rule of law across the government, Senator Sessions was at the forefront. That’s no surprise. Before opposing the political establishment and draining the swamp were the president’s priorities, they were Jeff Sessions’ priorities in the Senate. It’s a fight he’s been leading for decades, on behalf of our state and our nation. Not that it was always easy. We faced criticism, from within and without. But Senator Sessions never wavered in his mission. He never stopped working to accomplish the president’s agenda. He was always open with us about the challenges we were facing and how he planned on tackling them. His message was always the same. We’d stick to our principles. We’d do the right thing, no matter what the critics might say. Those were more than just words to him. He’d lived them, every day, across more than 40 years of service to the people of Alabama. And he lived them when the law and ethical requirements of his office dictated he recuse from the Russia investigation. It’s unfortunate that a Democratic conspiracy theory bred in the fever swamps of Washington, D.C. drove a wedge between the president and Senator Sessions. There’s little doubt that the country would be better off if it had never happened. But the pressing issues of the day compel us to put our focus on the future, not the past. Before the coronavirus was in the headlines, Senator Sessions was warning about the danger China posed — to our economy, to our security, to our influence in the world. The next few years will determine whether this century will be defined by American values and American priorities, or whether it will belong to China. Now is not the time for political novices representing our state in our highest offices. We cannot afford to have our next senator learn on the job. We need experience, we need political courage, and we need someone who has demonstrated both over a career of service. We have the opportunity to have just that by sending Jeff Sessions back to Washington as our senator. We are fortunate that he is seeking to serve our state again. We need him — and President Trump needs him — now more than ever. Brett Talley is a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Trump administration.",0.0

(WKRG) — We’re getting a closer look at the protester accused of smashing the window of a police cruiser on Sunday. News 5 captured exclusive video of the woman using a bat to shatter the front passenger window of the MPD vehicle. Although you can see her face in the video, our camera was moving quickly to keep up with the frenzy of the moment. It happened as protesters were trying to get onto I-10 downtown. Officers used tear gas to break up the crowd. The new photo from MPD provides a better look at her face from a calmer portion of the protest. Investigators are hoping the public can help identify her so officers can charge her for the willful destruction of city property. The protest in Mobile was one of many across the country in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. An independent autopsy commissioned by his family found Floyd died of “asphyxiation due to neck and back compression” from Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. The autopsy from the Hennepin County medical examiner did not find evidence of asphyxiation and cited his underlying heart disease as a factor. No arrests were made at the protest in downtown Mobile on Sunday. However, MPD arrested more than a dozen people later that evening when a separate protest formed on Airport Boulevard near Interstate 65. LATEST STORIES:",0.0

Workers began Monday night removing the top portion of the obelisk in pieces in Birmingham’s Linn Park, about a day after protesters tried to remove it themselves during a protest over police brutality, including the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument was dedicated in 1904 and has stood in Linn Park as a memory to a war that began as a way to continue the oppression of black people. Live video filmed by AL.com overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It’s unclear where the pieces were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish removing the monument. The monument had been the subject of a court battle between the city of Birmingham and the state before protesters tried to bring it down Sunday. The monument has towered over the park despite the makeup of Birmingham being over 70% black. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said the city faces a fine for violating a state law that bans the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments.

In liberal cities and states, American citizens are more likely to be arrested for attending church than for fire-bombing one – as a crowd of rioters tried to do in Washington, D.C. Enough. Americans cannot and will not abide this violence and destruction any longer. If any government official does wrong, every American has the constitutional right to protest and demand justice, but no American is entitled to commit violence or destruction or join a lawless mob. The rule of law, not the rule of mobs, must prevail. First, we must fully understand that peaceful protestors demonstrate, they do not destroy. These are, in fact, riots – led by radicals, anarchists and criminals bent on mayhem and chaos. But far too many public officials don’t seem to understand this fact. Instead, they beg and plead with the public to be calm, peaceful, and responsible. But the many good people who heed those calls were never burning, looting, or vandalizing stores, monuments, and homes or attacking their fellow citizens or police. The radicals hear those pleas as signals of weakness and fear in face of their street-level terror. It only emboldens these predators to commit more violence, sow more fear, and wreak further havoc. These outlaws believe they have the law on the run. It is critical that the thin blue line that defends order from chaos have the support of their own elected leaders. Without that, innocent and upstanding law officers are left to doubt if doing their duty is appreciated. Law officers should be held accountable for wrongdoing, but that does not allow for the slandering, denigration, and disrespect of hundreds of thousands of self-sacrificing, courageous and honorable men and women of law enforcement. These fine officers spend a career serving others in countless ways, often at risk of their own lives, showing patience and understanding in the face of provocation. Nothing could be more harmful to achieving a safe society than having great officers depart the profession and others never apply. The crimes of the few should not outweigh the virtues of the many. That’s why we need more good cops, not fewer. We should immediately deploy all necessary resources and force to restore order and uphold justice for all. As Attorney General, I helped rebuild state, local, and federal law enforcement partnerships. Those should be activated to identify, pursue, and apprehend dangerous rioters before they strike again. The National Guard and other federal forces should be called on when needed. Together, we should “flood the zone” and target, remove and vigorously prosecute these rioters and criminals as soon as unrest begins. This strategy, conducted with overwhelming and combined numbers and force, would quell these riots before they engulf whole communities and spread further. We cannot allow our police forces to be outnumbered or overrun when facing these kinds of violent hordes. President Trump is right: these rioters are acting as terrorists and should be treated as such. The burning of the Minneapolis police station and the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, the murder of an African American federal security officer in California, the injuries to more than 60 Secret Service agents defending the White House, and the countless other assaults on law officers, National Guardsmen, first responders, business owners, and innocent bystanders are not just attacks on people and property, they are direct attacks our system of justice and our commitment to be a nation of laws. The last few nights have made clear that rioters and looters have twisted the memory of George Floyd and have distorted the message of justice from the peaceful protestors and have turned it into an excuse for anarchy, crime, and destruction. George Floyd deserved better. Fortunately, security cameras and the widespread use of smartphones provide us with substantial evidence that can be used to bring the rioters to justice. State, local, and federal enforcement agencies across the country should commit to using all of their investigative resources to identify and prosecute the criminals depicted in those videos and images of assaults, destruction and looting over the past few nights. Every one of them must be brought to justice. And elected officials must commit to supporting that good work, not continuing to encourage the riots through leniency. Violent, destructive mobs cannot be allowed to rule our streets one minute longer. It must end now!

Kay Ivey issued a statement Monday in response to the weekend protests in Birmingham: ""Like so many others throughout the country and around the world, I, too, was shocked and angered by the tragic actions that led to the senseless death of George Floyd last week in Minneapolis. It is a death that should have never happened, and it is a tragedy for which that too many people, especially African-Americans, are all too familiar. ""Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night. ""While no state has a richer history than Alabama in terms of using peaceful protests to lead the country – and the world – to positive change, I agree with Alabama native, Congressman John Lewis, who this weekend said ‘rioting, looting and burning is not the way.’ ""Congressman Lewis marched alongside other Alabamians who would go on to become heroes of the movement. They were young, brave and determined. Many were beaten, arrested and jailed. But they all -- Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. Ralph David Abernathy, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, attorney and civil rights activist Fred Gray and others – led the fight for change in a peaceful way. ""I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. After all, our great country was born out of the desire to be free and the desire for freedom has repeatedly led to making positive change for the betterment of society. ""However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated. State assets are available to any local government that makes the request. We will show respect to ourselves and to each other through this process.""",0.0

The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck.

Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses.

Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud.

In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov.

I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests.

A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs.

Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents.

Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said.

But recovery is on the horizon and one critical industry in Alabama – the metallurgical coal industry – is poised to help lead the way. When most Americans think of coal, they think electricity, but metallurgical coal – called “met” for short – is used to produce steel. In fact, it’s used to produce 70% of the world’s steel, and the global appetite for steel could be poised for considerable growth. From China to Europe and here at home, economic recovery is likely to include infrastructure build out. China has already announced as much and China’s steel mills – used to produce nearly half of the world’s steel – are roaring back to life. Soaring steel production in China is underpinning rising global demand for met coal, a significant amount of which comes from U.S. mines. U.S. met producers – deemed an essential industry during the pandemic – are ready for China’s big build and for the likely surge in global infrastructure spending as nations look to put people back to work and get the wheels of the global economy moving in the right direction again. Whether the demand is coming from new roads, bridges or dams, or renewable energy systems or electric cars, the world needs steel and it needs metallurgical coal production. Nearly 1 billion tons of metallurgical coal is used each year to feed the world’s voracious appetite for steel, an appetite only expected to grow. Urbanization – a trend only accelerating – is driving immense demand for steel all over the world. As Bill Gates observed, when thinking about a global population racing towards 10 billion, “the world’s building stock will double in area by 2060. That’s like adding another New York City every month for 40 years.” That urbanization – that building and investment in infrastructure – means steel demand is likely to be 1.5 times higher than it is today by midcentury. Every ton of steel produced requires nearly as much metallurgical coal. Considering that the U.S. highway system alone has required about 6 billion tons of steel, met coal is inarguably essential to the world’s infrastructure future. It should be no surprise then that metallurgical production remains a growth area in the United States. Warrior Met Coal, based in Alabama, recently announced the construction of a new barge facility to move its growing production to market. In February, the company announced a new $578 million investment in an underground mine that will create 371 jobs. The U.S. metallurgical industry, like so many other industries, is working to weather the economic shock of the pandemic but it remains a foundational piece of our economy with rock-solid prospects. The nation’s more than 175 met mines directly employ more than 13,000 Americans, providing a key ingredient to build the infrastructure, cities and innovative technologies of today and tomorrow. As the U.S. and the world get to work on economic recovery, consider the industries, materials and fuels making it happen. The U.S. metallurgical coal industry will quite literally help provide the foundation upon which we rebuild both our infrastructure and our economy.

Demonstrators began assembling shortly after 8:00 p.m., and though tensions sometimes flared verbally, no physical altercations or property damage occurred. At the end of the night, one young woman who refused to leave the scene of the protest after the city’s COVID-19 imposed 10:00 p.m. curfew was arrested by the Montgomery Police Department. She was the only demonstrator arrested in downtown Montgomery on Monday, though the police department also took suspects into custody for the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue at Lee High School a few miles away.  Demonstrations had been held in Alabama’s capital city on Saturday and Sunday during the daylight hours, but Monday was the first gathering since an outbreak of violence in Birmingham ratcheted up tensions in the Yellowhammer State. Mayor Steven Reed held a press conference at 6:00 p.m. and urged all those willing who could to stay home for the next few nights. Various protesters tacitly acknowledged the violence in Birmingham and other cities across the country as they urged those assembled throughout the night to “stay calm” and “stay peaceful.” “If you’re an agitator, you don’t belong here,” said one woman when the crowd had swelled. There was evidence during the night that indicated the City of Montgomery was prepared for a more unruly evening than what occurred. A few dozen police officers were at the scene of the protest, but on the adjoining streets several more officers were close by that could have served as backup if needed. Businesses nearby had prepared for bad behavior. The Montgomery Police Department erected barriers one block away from the capitol in each direction, and the lines drawn by the officers were never broken by the demonstrators. Protesters began marching and chanting familiar nationwide slogans such as “black lives matter” and “Say his name — George Floyd” to begin their demonstration Monday night. Yellowhammer News walked amidst the protesters and was able to observe myriad levels of anger, disagreement about tactics and positive reassurance of the mission at hand for those assembled. Dozens of those assembled were documenting the event for social media, while others held signs and led the crowd in chants. There were even moments of levity, such as when one young woman demanded to know who of the protesting men were single, because she liked what she was seeing. Tensions were highest just after 9:00 p.m., when the crowd was at its largest and moved suddenly into close contact with the police standing behind a barricade.

After what appeared to be a long discussion with multiple officers, he appeared to leave the protest without being taken into custody. An officer confirmed to Yellowhammer News later in the night that the man had not been arrested. The removal of that man ended the most contentious portion of the evening. The crowd size began to diminish afterward, and there were only around 100 protesters remaining when the mandatory 10:00 p.m. curfew went into effect. Just after the curfew, there appeared to be some energy among those remaining to stay until the voice of an Alabama State University student named Talisa Boswell rose above the din of the crowd. “We’ll be back tomorrow,” Boswell promised as she urged her fellow demonstrators to obey the orders to disperse. The crowd appeared to take Boswell’s message to heart as the vast majority of protesters left the scene. One lone resisting woman was handcuffed and taken away by police at 10:15 p.m., and the department later confirmed to Yellowhammer that she had been arrested.

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0

Lee at its namesake local high school, Montgomery activists have mounted a campaign to lobby law enforcement officials to drop the felony charges. The statue was taken down sometime Monday night, as hundreds gathered just a few miles away on Dexter Avenue to protest police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Lee's toppling coincided with the dismantling of a Confederate memorial obelisk in downtown Birmingham, as protesters and citizens across the nation demanded Confederate memorials, built to commemorate a government resting on the principle of white supremacy, be taken down. More: Arrests made after Robert E. Lee High statue removed amid downtown protests Jeremy Selmar, 28, Jonathan Williams, 34, Joe Pernell, 35, and 28-year-old Maya Holley were each charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony, in connection to the statue toppling. According to state law, a person commits the crime of first-degree criminal mischief if damages to property exceed $2,500. “These statues and monuments should have been removed long ago and these activists just did what the city hasn’t had the courage to do,” said Ryan Dalton, a teacher at Sidney Lanier High — another Montgomery public school named after a Confederate leader. The Montgomery Bail Out Fund, established earlier this spring to post bail for county inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic, posted Tuesday morning all four had been bailed out. The Bail Out Fund was one of several groups and local activists to encourage people to call District Attorney Daryl Bailey's office and ask them to drop the charges against the four. Contacted Tuesday morning, Bailey said he hadn't yet seen the charges nor was consulted by the City of Montgomery. The Montgomery Advertiser has also reached out to the city and Mayor Steven Reed for comment.

""Join us in contacting the DA and demanding that all charges be dropped! #DropTheStatue #DropTheCharges"" The Montgomery Public School district on Tuesday announced the Lee statue had been moved to storage, though its pedestal bearing Lee's name was still standing outside the school. On Tuesday, it was repainted to cover up graffiti. Lashinda Carter, 42, was charged with third-degree criminal mischief about midnight in connection to the graffiti, Capt. Saba Coleman said. Any decisions made about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, city spokesman Griffith Waller said. More: Damaged statue of Confederate Robert E. Lee placed in storage after removal from school grounds The debate regarding confederate statues, Dalton said, is hypocritical. “It’s one of those situations where people cry and whine that removing these monuments and relics of the past that are honoring the Confederacy, Confederate soldiers and white supremacy, they cry and whine that we are erasing the past. But they are the very same people, when talking about slavery and systematic injustices, say ‘Oh let’s just leave the past behind and move on’,” Dalton said. Protesters on Monday night voiced strong opinions about Confederate memorials and statues. ""Montgomery full of slave trophies,” one man said, before saying the memorials ""had to come down."" The statue was unveiled in 1908, a commemoration of a white supremacist government defeated 43 years earlier. The statue was one among a spike of Confederate memorials built across the country in the early 1900s during a period of intense racial tensions in the country. A second wave of Confederate memorials were commissioned during the later Civil Rights Movement. More: More than 1,700 Confederate symbols remain in public spaces, SPLC reports It was initially placed at the corner of Madison Terrace and Winona Avenue.

Dalton added that because the alleged crimes took place on MPS property, “I would also encourage MPS to actively work toward all charges being dropped and for all schools named after white supremacists to be renamed.” Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Kirsten Fiscus at 334-318-1798 or KFiscus@gannett.com.

Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.”",0.0

Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets.

""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets.

(WPRI) — Violence and destruction erupted in downtown Providence overnight which resulted in dozens of arrests, several police officers hurt, businesses looted and a police cruiser being torched. Gov. Gina Raimondo and other state and city officials held a news conference late Tuesday morning to address what happened. She began by reminding the public how proud she was to be a Rhode Islander after seeing and hearing about the peaceful protests held over the weekend. “I stand before you disheartened, dismayed, outraged, and angry at the events that we saw last night right here in the city of Providence,” Raimondo said. “Make no mistake about it, what we saw last night was not a protest, what we saw last night was an organized attack on our community at a time when we are already vulnerable.” (Story continues below.) The governor noted how people showed up armed with crowbars, gasoline, flares and other items to intentionally hurt people and destroy property. Having seen the damage to businesses that are just reopening after being shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Raimondo assured the owners that the state will help get them back on their feet. She also announced she’s activating the R.I. National Guard to assist state and local police in the coming days. Mayor Jorge Elorza announced late Tuesday afternoon that he has issued a citywide curfew beginning Tuesday night. Elorza said the curfew, which will be in place until June 9, will begin at 9 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. “This is not a decision that we take lightly and this is not a decision we make easily,” Elorza said. (Story continues below.) Both Warwick and Cranston have also issued citywide curfews beginning at 8 p.m. after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Central Falls and Pawtucket soon followed suit – issuing an 8:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, after hearing similar reports about their communities. East Providence also issued a citywide curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU said called the curfews “an extraordinary and overly broad action that, ironically, can only promote the types of discriminatory police actions that have prompted peaceful protests this past week.” It all started when hundreds of people gathered outside the mall to demand justice for George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The incident was captured on video and has since sparked protests around the country. Rhode Island State Police Col. James Manni said he received a tip around dinner time Monday of a “planned disturbance,” calling it a coordinated attack by anarchists trying to come into the city and take it over. As a result of the tip, Elorza said the mall decided to close at 7 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. and city police were on alert. Elorza said even though police were in place ahead of time, the number of people was almost impossible to stop. By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of people blocked off Francis Street, meeting a line of officers in the middle. Police continuously tried to clear the area but were met with resistance. (Story continues below.) The situation escalated when they stormed the mall with officers giving chase. People could be seen running toward storefronts on the first floor, looting and causing damage. Officers were seen working hastily to block off the entrances to the mall. Police said about 200 to 300 people were trying to get inside but only about 75 to 100 were successful. More than a dozen businesses inside the mall were looted and vandalized, according to police. The mall had just reopened to customers on Monday after it was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NEW: Providence Place Mall will be closed through Friday, according to a spokesperson. Tentatively reopening Saturday. — Steph Machado (@StephMachado) June 2, 2020 Police said the looters were not inside the mall for long, since they were able to drive them out toward Cranston Street. In total, Elorza said 65 people were arrested, of which 35 were from Providence, five were from Massachusetts, and the rest were from other Rhode Island cities and towns. (Story continues below.) Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré told Eyewitness News that nine police officers and troopers were injured after bricks were thrown at them. Four were from the Providence Police Department and five were from the Rhode Island State Police. Some of the officers were treated for minor injuries on scene while others declined treatment. Paré said police deployed “less than lethal tear gas” when a large number of people started throwing bricks and other objects at officers. (Story continues below.) Around 1 a.m., people began targeting police cruisers; they could be seen smashing the windshield and windows of one outside the mall before lighting it on fire. Officials said five cruisers were damaged in all, including the one that was set ablaze. The crowd eventually dispersed outside the mall, however, looting and vandalism continued elsewhere in the city. (Story continues below.) This is what is left of a Providence Police car torched by protestors overnight. @wpri12 pic.twitter.com/kS8tiehGKq — Brandon Truitt (@BrandonTruittTV) June 2, 2020 Paré said there was one report of shots fired, but didn’t identify who that came from or if there was any truth to the report. “This was a mob, this was not protesters,” Manni said. “This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city and once gas was deployed, they dispersed into the streets into the neighborhoods.” (Story continues below.)

""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly.' On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump 'arguably' has the authority to use military force, 'so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. 'Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.' Thune said he would 'prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump's actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation's capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. 'This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. ... All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story.",0.0

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv.

Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.' He underlined that Europeans 'support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are 'understandable and more than legitimate.' 'I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,' Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. 'It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,' Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., 'that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.' Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color 'is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.' ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP's latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

In some incidents, members of the news media appeared to be targeted, by police and protesters alike. “Targeted attacks on journalists, media crews and news organizations covering the demonstrations show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them,” said Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Authorities in cities across the U.S. need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation.” Unrest in America: Peaceful protesters lament violence at George Floyd demonstrations, but understand the rage behind it The CPJ said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.

Officers moved to clear the streets of protesters who remained out past a citywide curfew when they arrested Martínez Contreras. He was issued a summons for failing to obey an order to disperse and was released from police custody early Tuesday morning. Also on Monday, Delaware News Journal reporter Jeff Neiburg and video strategist Jenna Miller were covering protests in Philadelphia when they were detained for about two hours, despite showing their credentials several times and saying they were media. They were released shortly after 9 p.m. and won't be charged. Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Patrick Brennan was briefly detained Monday evening by police while covering protests in the city.

In a video apparently recorded in a police transport vehicle while still at the Merle Hay Mall and then posted on Twitter, Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. KCCI earlier showed Sahouri sitting on a curb with her hands zip tied behind her back. It appeared she was wailing in pain from the pepper spray. Another reporter who was with her at the event was not arrested but shared the same account with editors before Sahouri posted her video on Twitter. Sahouri was released hours later and charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts. On Saturday night, Branden Hunter, a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, went to an emergency room in Detroit after police administered tear gas during a protest. A cellphone, which was livestreaming the event, was knocked from a Free Press photographer's hand.

""I pulled out my camera to record the incident while being sure not to walk toward officers or have any other items in my hand,"" Davis wrote in an essay for USA TODAY. ""The officer redirected his chemical spray from the fleeing duo toward me."" Davis said the officer ""laid on the trigger for a few seconds"" as Davis told him he was a journalist.

Saturday night, MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi wrote on Twitter that he was ""hit in the leg by a rubber bullet"" in Minneapolis but was fine. ""State Police supported by National guard fired unprovoked into an entirely peaceful rally,"" he said. 'Fired tear gas ... at point blank range' Los Angeles Times journalist Molly Hennessy-Fiske said Saturday evening that she was at the 5th Precinct in Minneapolis with ""at least a dozen"" journalists when members of the Minnesota State Patrol advanced toward the group. She said the journalists identified themselves, but officers ""fired tear gas canisters on us at point-blank range."" Hennessy-Fiske said they asked officers where they should go to avoid dispersal tactics. ""They did not tell us where to go,"" she said. ""They did not direct us. They just fired on us."" She said she ""got hit with a rubber bullet ... maybe two."" Reuters producer Julio César Chávez said early Sunday morning that he ""was shot in the arm and the back of my neck with rubber bullets"" and his security adviser ""was shot in the face,"" though a gas mask protected him. Another Reuters photographer, Lucas Jackson, said that late Saturday night in Minneapolis a man disguised as a medic attacked him with a crowbar, breaking the camera he was using to document the protests. He was ""a white man with a Red Cross on his chest who came out of nowhere,"" Jackson said. Vice News correspondent and producer Michael Anthony Adams shared video of Minneapolis troopers approaching him and several other journalists Sunday morning at a gas station where they had taken shelter.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Saturday, photographer Ellen Schmidt and freelance photographer and former Review-Journal employee Bridget Bennett were arrested while covering protests on the Strip. In Louisville early Saturday morning, protesters vandalized a car with the logo of news station WLKY on the driver side door. According to one of the station's reporters, Deni Kamper, chief photographer Paul Ahmann was attacked by a mob of protesters and thrown to the ground. Kamper posted on Twitter that Ahmann was ""being treated but is also ok."" The previous day in Louisville, WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and photojournalist James Dobson were struck by pepper balls fired at them by a Louisville Metro Police Department officer. WAVE 3 news issued a statement to ""strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer."" In Phoenix, a protester charged and made contact with CBS 5 and 3TV reporter Briana Whitney Saturday night outside Police Department headquarters. The Pittsburgh Public Safety Department said Sunday that three journalists were injured by protesters.

Hundreds flocked to downtown in protest of police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. While the protest was tense at times, no acts of violence occurred. Montgomery police Chief Ernest Finley, who was present downtown, in a statement released Tuesday commended his officers for their professionalism and the protesters for keeping it peaceful. ""Our officers are on patrol again today to serve and protect our citizens. I encourage parents to be vigilant and ensure that our youth are mindful of our current citywide curfew,"" he said. Finley said officers would be reviewing footage ""of last night's incidents and there will be more arrests made."" ""We will fulfill our duty to provide a safe and secure environment while maintaining order,"" he said. The first arrests were made around 9 p.m. at Lee High School, about an hour before protesters disbanded from downtown. More: Activists urge officials to drop charges against 4 arrested for toppling Lee High statue A statue of Robert E. Lee, standing in front of the school, was toppled during the night. Police arrested 28-year-old Maya Holley, 34-year-old Jonathan Williams, 28-year-old Jeremy Selmar and 35-year-old Joe Pernell Jr. Each of the four were charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony. According to arrest affidavits for the four, damage to the statue was estimated to be about $10,000. Shortly after the protest ended, 23-year-old Savannah Mchellon was charged with violating the curfew in place after refusing to leave the protest scene, police Capt. Saba Coleman said. Lashinda Carter, 48, was arrested about midnight in the 200 block of Ann Street on a charge of third-degree criminal mischief. Carter is charged in connection to graffiti on the pedestal that the Lee statue stood on, Coleman said. Reports of damage across the city were steady from 10 p.m. Monday until about 7 a.m. Tuesday, Coleman said. Police responded to: The 6200 bock of Atlanta Highway about 10 p.m. in reference to damage to an ATM. There was evidence of forced entry, but it's unclear if any money was stolen.

There are only two reasons: performative wokeness or performative weakness. There is a difference, but every single time some sad white politician thinks he or she can quiet a mob or show solidarity by taking a knee they are sadly mistaken. That never appears to be the goal. This appears to be about pandering acquiescence and nothing more. Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle, a public official of one of the most progressive non-college towns in the state, took a knee at a “mostly peaceful protest.” Mayor Battle kneels in prayer with protesters in Downtown #HuntsvilleAL: ""We hear you, and we are here with you.""#GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/rJWB0svwOw — @HsvMayorsOffice (@HsvMayorsOffice) June 2, 2020 Why? According to Battle, he was attempting to show he supported the protest to keep his community safe. “You know, I walked up and they said ‘kneel with me,'” Battle said on WVNN’s “The Dale Jackson Show.” “I didn’t know if they wanted to pray or if they wanted to kneel, but I was fine with it. You know, there’s no pride in this thing. The pride is getting through the event and getting through it with our community intact and without shots being fired and without windows being broken. If it takes kneeling, I’ll kneel to try to make sure our community is safe.” That is performative wokeness. When asked about the chants and demands that cops kneel at this same protest, Battle said he never saw that and felt there was no need for it from Huntsville police. “They kept saying, ‘They need to kneel, they need to kneel.’ There wasn’t a need for them to kneel. They were standing there doing their job and they were standing there as a blue line in front of everybody to make sure people were safe,” Battle explained.

He can, and does, support the removal of the Confederate memorial on Madison County Courthouse grounds but these protesters still wanted an image of him on his knees. They got it. Did he get what he wanted? Nope. Tear gas was needed, rocks were thrown, rioters went to another part of the city, and attempted to attack a shopping center. Too bad he couldn't wait even an hour before deploying PD to arrest and gas them. — Petercat (@thepetercat) June 2, 2020 So it is now performative weakness on Battle’s part. We will see how it plays out at the next scheduled protest in Huntsville on Wednesday. Nationally, Joe Biden visited a church in Delaware and took this photo: Now, this is performative wokeness! Mask on tight, even though it was off earlier in the visit. Biden centered in the photo, down on one knee, while black leaders stand behind him. It might as well be this episode of “South Park,” where a main character attempts to atone for a racial slur by kissing Jesse Jackson’s backside (it didn’t work). Joe Biden is doing whatever he needs to win an election, nothing more. That is performative wokeness. When it comes to a politician or any other figure being cajoled to take a knee in solidarity with protesters, it can only be a sign of performative wokeness or performative weakness. Those are the only options. Americans do not want their leaders “taking a knee” to anyone. They want strength and someone who stands tall. As cities burn and threats to businesses and communities remain, the last thing people want is the appearance of wokeness from their leaders and they definitely don’t want weakness. That’s what this is. Whether you like Trump or not, walking out to a burned church after ordering a park cleared of a disruptive element is a statement of power and leadership. .@realDonaldTrump walks from the White House to the Historic St. John’s Church that was damaged during a night of unrest. pic.twitter.com/TWUckesbnE — Doug Mills (@dougmillsnyt) June 2, 2020 The media hates this. They wanted Trump trapped in the White House while they cheerlead for chaos and carnage. They all want Trump to look weak, but he is engaging in performative strength. The question is about what Americans want from leaders. Americans want more strength, more law and order, less violence and a sense of normalcy. Trump has to deliver this, not with words and photo ops but in action, too.

(Photo: Todd Van Emst/AU Athletics) AUBURN — There are so many things on everyone's minds right now, Auburn athletics director Allen Greene said, that it's difficult to focus on a topic that dominated the conversation just weeks ago — the return of sports. Nationally, there is unrest caused by racial injustices, police brutality and the protesters who have had enough. More locally, in the Auburn community, there is mourning of the loss of legendary football coach Pat Dye, who died Monday. ""Our plates are only so big,"" Greene said. ""The challenges we’re all facing as Americans and as global citizens are starting to mount."" But one of those challenges is how to safely bring back sports during a global health pandemic that has cause more than 100,000 deaths. It's beginning this week — the SEC announced on May 22 that its 14 member schools could welcome student-athletes back to campus to begin voluntary workouts beginning this upcoming Monday, June 8. On Tuesday, Greene and head football coach Gus Malzahn revealed, for the first time publicly, how Auburn University plans to proceed. Football players will return to a campus which has effectively been closed since March 12 on Thursday. Another phase of athletes, including men's basketball players, will join them later this month, with the third place taking place in July. ""It’s not foolproof. This virus, it’s different,"" Greene said. ""But the plan that we have in place is one of the best plans I’ve seen.” It includes testing for COVID-19, quarantines for those who test positive, contact tracing and a series of social distancing guidelines. ""I’m very excited and I know our staff is excited to have our players back,"" Malzahn said. ""This is really big. We’re ready to get things back going.” Auburn strength and conditioning coach Ryan Russell will be the one running workouts, initially in small groups of just eight players. (Photo: Todd Van Emst/AU Athletics) What is Auburn's immediate testing plan? All members of Auburn's football team, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not, will be tested first thing Friday morning. The results are expected back within 24 hours. Once those results are back, players who test negative for the virus will go through regular athletic physicals and concussion tests over the weekend. For the first seven days players are back on campus, Malzahn said Auburn is planning on keeping the entire team isolated and quarantined together, with players splitting their time between only the dorm building everyone is staying in and the athletics complex. Players will have a roommate. ""I don't know what other teams are doing, but I'd bet very few are doing that,"" Malzahn said. What happens if a player tests positive? Team physician Dr. Michael Goodlett has a protocol in place, Malzahn said: If anyone does test positive, that person will be quarantined in a separate dorm. The plan is to have players come in for testing in small groups, so Auburn will ""know who was around who,"" Malzahn said, and can trace whether the highly contagious virus — which can be transmitted quickly even by asymptomatic carriers — may have spread within the team. How often will players be tested? Malzahn said ""that's still undecided at this point,"" though Auburn does have the ability to test at any time. The SEC recommends testing only ""symptomatic team members (including all student-athletes, coaches, team support and other appropriate individuals),"" despite the risk of asymptomatic spread. There will be temperature gauges and checks for symptoms every day before players enter the football facility, and Malzahn said everyone will be given a mask to wear. Dana Marquez, Auburn's associate athletic director for equipment operations, has plenty of experience making them. ""The good thing is our coaches have been back for two-and-a-half or three weeks, and we've all been operating,"" Malzahn said. ""It's gone very well so far."" How will the workouts be run? No university in the country will be allowed to conduct anything resembling a football practice. What the NCAA has permitted them to do is hold ""voluntary"" workouts overseen by the strength and conditioning staff, rather than the team's on-field coaches and assistants. It’s mandatory that you volunteer😂😂😂 ain’t no question https://t.co/YQgme8lzM0 — Kerryon Johnson (@AyeyoKEJO) May 23, 2020 Malzahn said players will work with strength and conditioning coach Ryan Russell in groups of eight, organized in part by experience — veteran players will start out with 30-minute windows, while younger players and incoming freshmen will start out a little slower. ""We haven’t seen our players in, what, 10 or 11 weeks?"" Malzahn said. ""Coach Russell is well-prepared to start building that foundation, not assuming anything. We’ve got extra ways to make sure our guys are hydrated more than they normally would. So we’re going to make sure we’ll gradually bring the whole team along."" Teams are still permitted to hold up to eight hours of meetings, film review and install with players each week, like they have been for the last few months. Those sessions will continue take place via Zoom. ""We’ll also do some team-building things that first week since we’ll have so much free time,"" Malzahn said. What comes next? That's entirely unclear, at this point. The SEC has made no official plans beyond allowing voluntary workouts to begin. Malzahn said the league is kicking around ideas such as extending fall camp or allowing teams to hold NFL style OTAs (organized team activities), but they're still just ideas. ""I think the decision makers are still in the process of seeing how the first week or two goes,"" the head coach continued. The same can be said for Auburn. The athletic department and its doctors, including Goodlett and university medical director Dr. Fred Kam, have discussed how to handle coronavirus safety protocols in the event that the football program is eventually allowed to begin doing more on the field in larger groups. But for right now, everyone's focus is solely on the first week to two weeks. ""I think the big thing is just getting our guys to understand how we're going to operate as far as keeping ourselves safe,"" Malzahn said. ""It's bigger than them. You've got to understand — I probably worry just as much about my coaches and older guys, support staff. We're just going to be responsible. ""I think the motivating factor is that we all want to play football. I promise you our players are probably at the forefront of that. So, with coming back, there's going to be a responsibility.

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) Warning: Social media embeds may contain profanity WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. After some people broke into a Zara on Broadway lots of police arrived, by car, bike, on foot. pic.twitter.com/B2UWZ5hLfR — Jan Ransom (@Jan_Ransom) June 3, 2020 “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0
1623649682,2020-06-02 16:24:51,Push to relocate Confederate memorial from Downtown Huntsville as monuments are removed around the South,https://whnt.com/news/huntsville/push-to-relocate-confederate-memorial-from-downtown-huntsville-as-monuments-are-removed-around-the-south/,en,False,"terrorism, crime and criminals, monuments and memorials",82215,whnt.com,http://whnt.com/#spider,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. – There is a movement to relocate the Confederate memorial from the Downtown Huntsville Courthouse Square. If removed, the Alabama Attorney General may file a lawsuit against the city for violating the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act. City leaders with Downtown Huntsville Inc. say that they want the statue to be moved to a “historically-contextual location that would allow our community to learn from the great pain that this memorial represents while also removing it from our community’s courthouse grounds.” They ask for Huntsville government leaders to “utilize all available means to take this step to promote the healing process.” “The tragic killing of George Floyd has magnified the deep pain experienced by African-Americans and other members of our community. We are heartbroken by this pain and believe a true path toward healing requires more than words of reconciliation or statements of empathy and support. Rather, this path toward understanding and healing requires specific actions to directly advance this critical process. Today, we advocate that one such step should be the removal and relocation of the Confederate Memorial from the Downtown Huntsville Courthouse Square to a historically-contextual location that would allow our community to learn from the great pain that this memorial represents while also removing it from our community’s courthouse grounds. We implore our government leaders on all levels to utilize all available means to take this step to promote the healing process. We understand that the removal and relocation of this artifact will not remove historical prejudices and pain by itself, but we hope it represents a sincere statement to our fellow community members that we are listening to their pain and seek to meaningfully further a process of healing together with them.” Downtown Huntsville, Inc.

(AP Photo/Jay Reeves) A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. “On Monday, I advised Mayor Woodfin that the removal of the 115-year-old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors monument in Birmingham’s Linn Park would violate the law and that I would fulfill my duty to enforce it,” said AG Steve Marshall. “Monday night, the City of Birmingham removed the monument and today I am filing a new lawsuit against the City for violating Alabama law.” Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. Read the full lawsuit here:",0.0

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris.

They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets.

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) Warning: Social media embeds may contain profanity WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. After some people broke into a Zara on Broadway lots of police arrived, by car, bike, on foot. pic.twitter.com/B2UWZ5hLfR — Jan Ransom (@Jan_Ransom) June 3, 2020 “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

1623684241,2020-06-02 17:35:00,Pelosi Asks Black Caucus To Come Up With Police Reforms Following Protests,https://www.apr.org/post/pelosi-asks-black-caucus-come-police-reforms-following-protests,en,False,"politics and government, blacks, discrimination, demonstrations and riots",109301,apr.org,http://apr.org/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response to the protests that have swept the country following the death of George Floyd. House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

What started as a peaceful gathering in Linn Park on May 31 escalated when protesters vandalized a statue of Charles Linn, a Finnish-born seafarer who immigrated to Alabama in 1838 and served as a captain in the Confederate States’ Navy. Among the businesses damaged were Alabama Power, People’s Bank of Alabama, The California Fashion Mall and The Alabama Theatre. Wheelhouse Salon, which is located across the street from The Alabama Theatre, had its storefront windows shattered. Looters ransacked and robbed the business. Among the items stolen were iPad-based cash registers and computers. Johnny Grimes is the owner of Wheelhouse Salon. (Read more about the Birmingham business by clicking here.) Damage reported Grimes was asleep when one of his employees from Wheelhouse called and woke him with news of the riots. After hearing the news, he pulled up security footage from the salon from his home where at one point he saw members of Birmingham’s SWAT team enter and clear Wheelhouse’s building. After watching from home and waiting there until he felt it was safe, Grimes went to the salon, surveyed the damage and began securing the store. While he and an employee began cleaning up, Grimes saw rioters set fire to The California Fashion Mall, which is located down the street from Wheelhouse. Grimes and other employees boarded up Wheelhouse’s broken windows and cleaned up the mess left by the rioters on June 1. The store was only closed for one day, however, and reopened – while still in ill repair – on June 2. “We felt that it was important to get back open as soon as possible,” said Grimes. ‘Actions won’t deter us’ Grimes said the decision to reopen quickly was necessary due to the recent financial constrains related to COVID-19. He emphasized that he and Wheelhouse’s staff care deeply about Birmingham and believe that the recent riots do not reflect the values of the city. “I felt the need to stand up and say, ‘These types of actions don’t define us and they aren’t going to deter us. We are Birmingham and we are going to stand united with our African-American brothers and sisters,’” said Grimes. “We are going to open up and we are going to continue to serve the community.” Recent rioting and looting not only does not represent Birmingham as a city, but it does not represent the movement to highlight injustices perpetrated on George Floyd, said Grimes. Grimes said that he hopes and prays that, while the riots were unjust, that they did not happen “for nothing.” National conversation needed “(I hope) that it does spark a national conversation that’s based around racial reconciliation, but also how African-Americans are treated in our country and police brutality,” he said. “Our windows can be replaced. Our iPads can be replaced. Our Square registers can be replaced. Our computers can be replaced. What can’t be replaced is the life of George Floyd,” said Grimes. “And so I understand. I understand the rage and the frustration that the African-American community is feeling. I identify with it. I sympathize with it. “I just hope that this leads to a greater conversation that actually produces change in our country,” he said. State of emergency declared Following the night’s events, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin issued a state of emergency for Birmingham and an indefinite nightly curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., with exceptions for “medical service, food or other essential needs … (and) essential workers,” according to Woodfin. In a June 1 press conference, the mayor said that he supports civil disobedience but that that “is very different from civil unrest.” “I support activism, and your right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs and people destroying things just because,” said Woodfin. “Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest,” said Woodfin. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform, and anybody that is doing the looting, anybody that’s breaking things just because, anybody that’s setting fires just because — I want to make this very clear to you, you’re not doing that in the name of reform or George Floyd, you’re on a different agenda that the City of Birmingham will not tolerate,” he said. “And I want to make this clear. You don’t get a second chance at it,” said Woodfin. “That means no more parades, no vigils, no more demonstrations.” ‘Not the way’ Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that she “was shocked and angered by the tragic actions that led to the senseless death of George Floyd,” in a June 1 statement. Ivey denounced the rioting and destruction of property. “It is a death that should have never happened and it is a tragedy for which that too many people, especially African Americans, are all too familiar,” said Ivey. “Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night. “While no state has a richer history than Alabama in terms of using peaceful protests to lead the country — and the world — to positive change, I agree with Alabama native, Congressman John Lewis, who this weekend said ‘rioting, looting and burning is not the way,’” she said. While she “will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration,” Ivey said that she “will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point.” Regarding the riots in Birmingham, Ivey said such behavior was “unbecoming” of the city and an affront to “all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is.” Ivey announced that she had given authorization to activate up to 1,000 National Guard guardsmen to respond to violent protests should the need arise. “While there is no immediate need for us to deploy our Guard, I have given authorization to Adjutant General Sheryl Gordon to be on standby, should our local and state law enforcement need additional support,” said Ivey. Commitment to justice In an evening press conference June 1, President Donald Trump addressed recent riots across the country. “All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family that justice will be served — he will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob,” said Trump. Grimes and Wheelhouse Salon plan to create a GoFundMe site to raise money to repair their salon, as well as other businesses damaged during the riots.

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

Vance Federal Building and the Hugo L. Black U.S. Courthouse. Both federal buildings, along 5th Avenue North, sustained broken glass during the overnight unrest throughout Birmingham. “Federal agencies are using all of our tools to investigate the perpetrators and who is behind the damage to federal property and those individuals will be brought to justice,’’ said Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town. ""The right to free speech and assembly are cornerstones of our American freedom. Do so freely. Do so responsibly. Do so lawfully,'' Town said. “Those who hijack this peaceful process by organizing, inciting or participating in riotous behavior and civil unrest will be brought to justice.” A peaceful rally Sunday afternoon that started in Kelly Ingram Park ended a short distance away in Linn Park with protesters trying to remove a confederate monument, spray-painting and chiseling at its base. Demonstrators then moved from the park and began breaking windows in banks, offices, bars, restaurants and salons. Gunshots could be heard into the early hours. Fires were lit in streets, dumpsters and gutted the California Fashion Mall. Heavily armed police and angry protesters filled the streets through the night. Police said the riots resulted in burglaries at 14 businesses with another 13 businesses that had significant damage ranging from broken windows to vandalism to looting. Authorities said 24 arrests were made in Birmingham. Town, FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. and U.S. Marshal Marty Keely on Monday issued a joint warning about possible federal crimes, which bring longer prison sentences than state convictions. “Those who cause any damage to federal property have committed a federal crime and will be prosecuted in a federal court. We have zero tolerance for those who incite, organize, encourage, or engage in civil unrest, violence, and destructive behavior anywhere in the Northern District of Alabama. And make no mistake, we will bring those individuals to justice who do.” Town said it’s very important that local and state agencies share crime intelligence with their federal partners so they can determine whether individuals are coming in from outside of the state or using any facility in interstate commerce such as cell phones, social media, and the internet to direct, organize or participate in the civil unrest. “We have a federal interest, a federal stake in that type of information and there are a number of federal offenses as it relates to riots, civil unrest, the use of incendiary devices or participating in any type of arson of these buildings,’’ Town said. “The FBI along with other federal agencies are working around the clock and, frankly, so is my office to ensure that we have up-to-date crime intelligence and that we’re using it to pursue these individuals so that we can bring them to justice in a federal court.”",0.0

LOUIS — Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy’s store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd’s death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy’s flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama’s largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work. Live video showed workers attaching straps to the peak of the obelisk so it could be lifted away with a crane. Within a few hours they had removed the top of the monument. Woodfin said the city would see if the memorial could be given to a museum or another group. Woodfin said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. ___ CICERO, Ill. — Two people have been killed during unrest in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania says 60 people were arrested in the town of about 84,000 located west of Chicago. Hanania didn’t provide additional information about those killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff’s Office were called in to help local police Monday as people broke into a liquor store and other businesses and stole items. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a George Floyd demonstration Monday night in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Video from the scene shows the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackle a protester on the street and handcuff him. Officers are seen scattering to avoid the SUV as it drives off on Buffalo’s east side. Apparent gunshots are heard. The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said they were in stable condition. ___ WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officers used tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters to turn back demonstrators in Washington protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters remained on the streets well past the 7 p.m. curfew that had been imposed by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. They had spent hours marching peacefully around the nation’s capital before they were buzzed by the helicopters, which kicked up debris. A standoff developed within site of the Capitol. Protesters smashed windows at the Teamsters building as they dispersed. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from Louisville’s downtown Jefferson Square, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. Riot police with batons at the ready stood shoulder to shoulder as they advanced down key streets before breaking up the protest after a brief standoff shortly after 10 p.m. Demonstrators shouted at police as authorities on a microphone ordered the crowd to disperse before loud bursts of tear gas crackled and spread acrid, choking smoke over the area. Protesters began running and military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the key square fronting a courthouse complex. Some protesters gasped and held wet cloths to their faces as they ran from the wafting gas and advancing police. A helicopter clattered overhead amid the bursts of tear gas fire, and streets appeared to largely empty out. ___ Tiger Woods is speaking out for the first time since George Floyd’s death, saying his heart goes out to Floyd, his family and everyone who is hurting right now. The golfer says he has always had the “utmost respect for our law enforcement,” but Floyd’s death crossed a line. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. Referencing the protests in his statement, Woods says, “We can make our points without burning the very neighborhoods we live in.” ___ ATLANTA — Protesters were still in the streets of downtown Atlanta on Monday night as curfew neared, and police officers and the National Guard used tear gas, starting shortly before 9 p.m. Protesters largely dispersed after that, though some remained, and officers were making arrests, apparently for curfew violations. A similar scene played out the night before. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The fatal shooting of the popular owner of a Louisville barbecue spot has prompted a massive march to the site where the restaurateur was killed early Monday. David McAtee died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests in the Kentucky city. Mayor Greg Fischer revealed earlier Monday that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation. The large group marched peacefully Monday evening as some honked horns in solidarity and marchers raised clenched fists. Louisville’s police chief was fired by the city’s mayor on Monday after the mayor learned that officers failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene were McAttee was shot. ___ NASHVILLE, Tenn. — More than 60 National Guard troops put down their riot shields Monday evening at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol in Nashville to honor George Floyd. Guardsman had initially rushed to grab their shields and form a hard line to block the slowly moving crowd — which was singing and chanting — from advancing up the Capitol steps. As the National Guard began moving, Tennessee State Police grabbed batons and formed a line behind them. However, the crowd remained calm. Democratic lawmakers leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd. As the crowd continued to sing and call for justice for black Americans, slowly the shields began to drop. The state troopers declined to drop their batons but backed farther away from the crowd. Monday’s peaceful vigil was a marked difference from several protests that turned violent in Tennessee over the weekend. ___ At least 5,600 people have been arrested in cities around the country since demonstrations broke out protesting the death of George Floyd, according to a tally compiled by AP journalists from police department press releases, police agency Twitter activity and media reports. The protests began after the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The arrests come as protests in some cities become more violent and as police and governors are urged by President Donald Trump to take a stronger hand in quelling the demonstrations. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, some 155 arrests have taken place. Some of the biggest cities in the U.S. have made a significant number of arrests, including nearly 800 in New York City and more than 900 in Los Angeles. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters took a knee in the middle of a downtown Washington street Monday night, chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” They applauded as they rose to their feet and declared that the streets were theirs. Over the past few nights, demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota had asked black police officers to take a knee to show their support. The march Monday night was peaceful as nightfall approached. There was no apparent effort to get protesters off the streets even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. Earlier, law enforcement officers on horseback and foot aggressively pushed the protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House so President Donald Trump could visit a church that was damaged by fire during the protests Sunday night. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters marched on the National Mall and D.C. streets after being driven from the White House by law enforcement officers on horseback and foot so President Donald Trump could visit St. John’s Church, which was damaged during the demonstrations Sunday night. The demonstrators passed the Lincoln and World War II Memorials and the Washington Monument on the Mall before heading back to the streets near the White House. There was no apparent attempt to disburse the protesters even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. At Farragut Square, a few blocks from the White House, there were about two law enforcement officers for every civilian. Multiple helicopters buzzed overhead, a relative rarity in the District of Columbia, which is normally a no-fly zone for helicopters and drones. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Heavy equipment arrived Monday night at the Birmingham park where protesters tried but failed to topple a more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone Sunday. It could be the first step toward removing the obelisk. Mayor Randall Woodfin has vowed to remove the monument, which was at the center of a court fight between the city and state over an Alabama law protecting rebel memorials. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday evening slammed President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. In an emailed statement in response to the president’s comments, the Democrat said Trump “has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office.” “He cowers at the feet of authoritarians around the world,” Inslee said. “Now he uses the most supreme power of the presidency in a desperate attempt to hide his timidity and vapidity. I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” The Seattle area has seen several days of violence, including vandalism in the city’s downtown core. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that “is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a Monday news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations. Trump spoke to governors via video teleconference. Brown said having National Guard soldiers on the streets was the wrong way to go. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. “Trump wants governors to deploy the national guard to intimidate the public.” Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. nightly. Police arrested 11 adults during protests Sunday and early Monday morning after authorities said projectiles — including “large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks” — were thrown at officers. “Having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants,” Brown said. ___ Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay for George Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, and the family has accepted the offer. Mayweather personally has been in touch with the family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. He will handle costs for the funeral on June 9 in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, as well as other expenses. TMZ originally reported Mayweather’s offer. “He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, he is definitely paying for the funeral,” Ellerbe told ESPN.com on Monday. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is visiting the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire as demonstrators clashed with police over the weekend. Beginning with James Madison, every person who has held the office of president has attended a service at St. John’s Church. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. Trump is urging the nation’s governors to get tougher with violent protesters and to deploy the National Guard. He said in the Rose Garden that he is an ally of peaceful protesters, but he stressed that “I am your president of law and order.” ___ PHILADELPHIA — Police fired non-lethal bullets and tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia on Monday just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. The crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs across the Delaware River. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted. More than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to block the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from downtown the city’s imposing art museum.",0.0

The startling and topical stencil was painted in the Kings Heath area of Birmingham on Monday night by Birmingham-based artist, Mohammed Ali. This freshly painted new art is an act of “solidarity” says the artist. Mohammed Ali is well known for producing street art which resonates with the people and throws a light on topical political and human stories. He has previously highlighted the plight of the Palestinians, the dramatic resignation of Theresa May, human rights in Bangladesh, and Islamophobia and racism. His latest work is fuelled by the savage death of gentle giant, George Floyd. The death, which was captured on mobile phones by pedestrians, shocked people in America and has sparked outrage and indignation around the world. President Trump is currently dealing with the public backlash against the savage murder 0f a handcuffed black man at the hands of a white police officer. Around 40 American states have been placed under curfew. Rangzeb Hussain | I Am Birmingham Ali’s freshly painted stencil, painted in Silver Street in Kings Heath, is a simple yet powerful work that gives voice to George Floyd who tragically lost his life in Minnesota while being violently arrested by a police officer. Ali uses the balance of two stark colours – black and white – to paint the stencil, and those two colour choices act as a powerful reminder about the theme of racism raging across America. Racism has no place in a civilised society, and the colour of a person’s skin or religion should not be used a badge or marker to grade a human life. Peter Lopeman Ali has taken that concept and applied it to his latest art which brings to life the terrible tragedy that befell poor George Floyd. The poetic and multi-layered stencil shows a gas mask with a smog-filled cityscape on the horizon, and the poignant plea that George Floyd kept repeating to the police officer – ‘I can’t breathe’ – forms part of a circular frame around the art. The metaphor for both environmental and human life are brought to the fore in Ali’s tribute to life. A world without freedom, without air, a place devoid of humanity. The terrifying gas mask also acts as a shocking reminder of faceless authority which cracks downs hard on protestors who dare to question injustice. Peter Lopeman There are some stars dotted around the circle which reference the stars and stripes of the American flag, and the art is finished off with some olive leaves which suggests a poetic prayer for peace, a new hope, and a fresh beginning despite the terrible tragedy that took place in Minnesota. Ali shared his thoughts after painting the stencil last night: “‘ I can’t breathe’ in Silver Street has just gone up in Kings Heath, Birmingham. “Solidarity across the ocean on the walls here in Birmingham, UK.” He also spoke about the first reactions to the art: “Wonderful to see people jumping out of cars to connect with a bit of black paint on a wall. “This is what public art should instil… something that resonates with the people. “Never underestimate the power of seeing truth upon a wall in a public space.” (Visited 524 times, 9 visits today)",0.0

The optimism that Shuttlesworth expressed went up in flames that Saturday evening, and since then America’s progress toward racial harmony has stumbled forward only intermittently. Not even the election of the nation’s first black president has put an end to America’s ugly racism, as the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer this month demonstrated once again. AD AD In 1963, a very different president — John F. Kennedy — faced rioting in Birmingham, a city that had become a focus of the civil rights movement. The Birmingham protest movement had its headquarters in the Gaston Motel, an establishment owned by city’s most prominent black businessman. King and other members of the movement’s leadership lodged at the motel. Word spread that the Klan, in its rage, planned to retaliate against the Birmingham agreement by murdering King with a well-placed bomb at the Gaston Motel. AD When Bull Connor heard of the plot, he rejected the advice of a visiting police chief from Albany, Ga., who urged him to set up a visible presence outside the motel to protect King and other black leaders. Dismissing the notion, Connor declared he wasn’t going to “guard that n----- son-of-a-bitch.” The blast rocked the motel, the sound of the explosion carrying far through Birmingham on the humid, heavy air. Bars and pool halls in the nearby neighborhoods emptied, blacks running toward the motel. The dynamite knocked out a wall, shattered windows and ripped apart the motel office just below Room 30, King’s suite. A mob swarmed outside seeking vengeance. Though King was spared, having left Birmingham earlier to return to Atlanta to preach at his church on Sunday, riots ripped through the city, fed further by two other bombs at the house of King’s brother, A.D. King. The first landed on the lawn; its impact was mostly limited to alerting A.D. King, his wife and five children who raced out the back to safety before a much larger bomb landed near the porch, ripping bricks off the walls, caving in the roof and hurling the front door deep into the house. AD AD By 4:30 a.m., as Mother’s Day dawned, Birmingham lay in devastation like a city in the aftermath of a wartime assault. The unrest had spread over a 28-block area. Fifty people had been injured. One policeman was stabbed. Scores of cars and police vehicles were destroyed, some were burned, and six small stores and a two-story apartment house went up in flames. The rioters weren’t Martin Luther King Jr.’s soldiers well-schooled in nonviolence, but rather long-suffering African Americans, scarred by the brutality regularly inflicted on them by police and white society, and invisible until they expressed their rage by torching their own community. In the afternoon, President Kennedy touched down on the South Lawn of the White House in an Army helicopter, cutting short his Mother’s Day weekend stay at Camp David. His attorney general and brother, Robert F. Kennedy, rolled up in his Ford Galaxie convertible packed with three aides and his dog Brummus. The men congregated inside the Oval Office along with four top figures from the military for an emergency meeting. The Oval Office conversation debated whether more violence was on the way, whether federal troops were needed to maintain law and order, and whether the agreement between the black community and Birmingham business leaders was in danger of falling apart. AD AD Kennedy, seated in his back-comforting rocking chair, had the delicate task of preserving the racial progress the agreement represented and ensuring business people and the city’s other white residents that violence would not erupt again. He knew he needed to be compassionate, flexible and well-informed. Without inflaming Birmingham’s white population by appearing to side with King, the president nonetheless wanted secretly to hear the civil rights leader’s reading of the situation. Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall, who helped navigate the agreement to fruition, had already spoken to King, who was rushing back to Birmingham to urge blacks to stay off the streets. “He intends to go around the city,” Marshall told the president, “and visit pool halls and saloons and talk to the Negroes and preach against violence.” Kennedy wanted to hear more from King. He asked Marshall to get King on the phone, and the adviser went to another room to phone the civil rights leader. AD AD The president had brought to the meeting a stack of papers, among which were copies of King’s most recent comments. Selecting one of the pages, Kennedy read out loud that King didn’t want the bombings to jeopardize the agreement, a sentiment the president shared. “Now there’s one other thing,” Kennedy said, shuffling through the papers, “where he’s asked me to make a statement.” He then read a portion of a United Press International news report in which King was quoted making a direct appeal to the president: King “said today the new outbursts would make it mandatory to take a forthright stand against the indignities which Negro citizens still face.” Marshall returned to Oval Office having asked King what kind of statement he advised the president to make. King just hoped the president would steer people away from violence and, according to Marshall, call on “everyone to be decent and respect law and order.” King said that, as long as there were no more bombings or other incidents, he expected the community to stay calm. But if Birmingham’s business leaders reversed themselves and rejected the agreement, King warned, “I can’t control the people.” AD AD At 9 p.m., Kennedy spoke on live television for barely a minute, his face framed in a tight camera shot. He said he was “deeply concerned” about events in Birmingham and mentioned the bombings of A.D. King’s house and the Gaston Motel, and the rioting that ensued, noting the damage, injuries and police brutality against African Americans. He said the government was prepared to do whatever was necessary “to preserve order, to protect the lives of its citizens, and to uphold the law of the land.” He praised the Birmingham agreement as “a fair and just accord” and vowed that the federal government would not allow it “to be sabotaged by a few extremists on either side.” He called upon Birmingham residents “to realize that violence only breeds more violence, and that good will and good faith are most important now.” In conclusion, he made clear his willingness to use force to maintain order and to ensure the settlement was enacted: He was dispatching troops trained in riot control to military bases near Birmingham, and he was taking preparatory steps for federalizing the Alabama National Guard should their deployment become necessary. With the resolution of a leader concerned about all of his constituents, the president straddled the line, delivering a strong, forceful endorsement of desegregation and equal rights; he also conveyed that he would brook no more violence from the black community. AD AD Birmingham fell quiet. King’s exhortations in churches, pool halls and bars helped preserve the peace. But reverberations of its unrest were rocking cities around the country: Demonstrations erupted in Jackson, Miss., and Raleigh, N.C., and spread to the North. Black Muslims sparked violent clashes in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem, and protests flared in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Syracuse and New Rochelle, N.Y. A troubling realization settled over the White House: Racial strife, far from abating, was intensifying. In response to the wildfire of protests sweeping the nation, Kennedy moved tentatively toward a dramatic solution. His aides began drafting legislation that would give the government the power to speed up integration of public facilities and schools. The president realized that action in Congress was necessary because Southern states easily subverted constitutional requirements on desegregation, and court efforts were circuitous and time-consuming. AD AD On June 11, after Alabama Gov. George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door to block black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama, Kennedy decided the time for action had come. With urgency and speed, he and his advisers cobbled together a speech that would come to define a part of Kennedy’s legacy, and at 8 p.m. that evening, he settled in front of television cameras in the Oval Office to announce plans to introduce civil rights legislation. As he spoke, the camera slowly zoomed in, enhancing the gravity and importance of his words. Framed in a tight head-and-shoulders shot, looking crisp in a white shirt, narrow tie and a handkerchief poking from his jacket pocket, the president asked the nation to take a lesson from the scenes in Alabama; he challenged Americans to be better, drawing on words that were in many ways about himself and his own journey that had brought him to this point: “I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience.” He reminded his listeners that America “was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.” As he spoke into the television camera that June evening, the president revealed a passion and commitment to civil rights that he had never before shown. In this address 2½ years into his term, the president found his moral voice, his commitment of mind and heart. Without hesitation or equivocation, he embraced black justice. AD “Recognizing the call of history,” early King biographer Lerone Bennett Jr. wrote, “Kennedy made an abrupt turn and accepted the mantle of moral leadership King had urged upon him.”",0.0

(WIAT) — Birmingham business owners are cleaning up after destructive protests Sunday night in the downtown area. A fire broke out at the California Fashion Mall, where there is also plenty of other damage to the doors and windows of the store. Shattered glass remains scattered across the concrete. “When I come here and saw it catch fire and I just prayed,” said David Kim, who has owned the business for about 35 years. Kim, who is Korean-American, was moved to see so many volunteers helping him clean Monday morning. He estimated he lost about $200,000 worth of merchandise. “Around me, there are many good people, but today I realize again that I am a lucky man to live in America,” said Kim. Several other businesses also sustained damage, including restaurants, bank buildings, and abandoned properties. At Adams Eye Care, owner Juanakee Adams has seen a lot of unrest in her 40 years as a Birmingham eye doctor. “God blessed and enabled me to be the first black female to practice optometry in the state of Alabama,” Adams said. Despite the damage to her shop, Adams said she will press on. She wants those doing damage to understand that lives are impacted by destructive protests. “I’m hoping that they’ll see that this is a face behind it. This is not just an empty building,” said Adams. While Adams is against violence, she understands the concern of the protesters. She thinks damaging property is counter-productive. “It was heartbreaking and for no rhyme or reason and I am sympathetic to their plight, but this is not a remedy. This just creates another problem,” said Adams. Volunteers came from all over the Birmingham area Monday to help. “We’ve got a broom. We’ve got a dust pan,” said Jacob Irvin. Irvin also supports the right to protest, but was surprised to see the violence that has played out in other cities. “When you see it in your own town it really hits you in the heart a lot more,” said Irvin. The cleanup will take plenty of time, but shop owners are thankful they’re not picking up the pieces alone. “I’m just teared up. Teared up. I couldn’t believe it,” said Kim. For any demonstrators who might be considering another round of destructive protests, business owners like Adams ask that you reconsider. “Please look at me.

Advertisement Police take a knee, drawing cheers, support from protesters in Fort Worth, Texas Share Shares Copy Link Copy Despite some tense moments during protests in Fort Worth, Texas, officers and the police chief drew praise when they kneeled with protesters to show support.Protesters there voiced concerns once again Monday night, drawing attention to deaths of black people by police officers. But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said. ""I hope it was meaningful. I hope that they — the people — hear, see our hearts. We certainly saw their hearts and that they were hurting.

Mayor Randall Woodfin made the declarations today during a nearly hour-long virtual news conference in the wake of protesters on Sunday night damaging downtown businesses and attacking reporters. “What started out with the best intentions turned into something that none of us deserve, none of our small business owners, none of our corporate community, the people in the media that were physically hurt, no one deserved what happened last night in this city we call home,” Woodfin said. “I want you to know that I 100 percent support civil disobedience, but that is very different from civil unrest, and I support activism and the right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs or people destroying things just because.” The citywide curfew will be implemented until further notice and last from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily, the mayor said. Travel on city streets will be limited with the exception of medical and essential personnel. Employees will need to provide a form or document to prove they need to work during the curfew hours. On Sunday, 24 people were arrested, 14 businesses were burglarized and 13 other businesses suffered significant damage, city officials said. Birmingham Fire and Rescue responded to 22 fire calls, five of which were commercial, the city said. Two members of the media were attacked, but no other injuries were reported at this time. The decision to declare a state of emergency came after city leaders determined lives were potentially at risk. Woodfin said. “We decided to declare it last night and announce it today. … What we’re seeing across the nation are a lot of people engaging in civil unrest and we need to make sure our citizens know in advance and (that there will be a) curfew,” he said. “The city of Birmingham is open to the additional resources as it relates to squashing civil unrest; we have no problem partnering with Alabama Law Enforcement Agency or the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office to assist us … to protect our citizens, first responders and to protect people’s property.” Like other leaders in the state, Gov. Kay Ivey said she was disappointed to see the chaos. Ivey issued a statement saying, “The Alabama National Guard stands ready to assist when peaceful protests become violent and dangerous to our public safety. I will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration. However, we will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point. “Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night,” she said in the statement. “What I saw happen last night in Birmingham was unbecoming of all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is. Going forward, this cannot be tolerated. State assets are available to any local government that makes the request. We will show respect to ourselves and to each other through this process.” Workers put up plywood at the Wheelhouse and the Shutter Shop in Birmingham after widows were broken during a protest Sunday evening.

(Marvin Gentry/The Birmingham Times) Following peaceful gatherings Sunday, protesters gathered in Birmingham’s Linn Park later in the evening and tried to remove Confederate statues. Birmingham police officers moved into the park, asking the crowd to disperse. Some left, but others began to destroy business property downtown along 19th and 20th Streets and Fifth Avenue North. Alabama Power was among the businesses damaged. “There was damage to the Alabama Power headquarters building as the result of recent protests which occurred overnight,” a statement from the company said. “While it’s unfortunate, it pales in comparison to the hurt, pain and concern faced by so many in our community and across the nation. Buildings can be replaced, but lives cannot. We must come together – business, communities and individuals alike – to fight against injustice and encourage and promote unity.” The mayor said he was disappointed at the way the entire episode transpired. “This is not who we are,” he said. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform and anybody that is doing the looting and breaking things and setting fires just because, you are not doing that in the name of George Floyd.” Birmingham Police Chief Patrick D. Smith said the world is waking up to see a very different Birmingham, “one that is hard to watch or take in,” he said. “What started out as a peaceful protest turned into something different. It is our intent as a police department to follow up on every single crime, we will look for and collect every video … and we need your (the public’s) help. It is our goal to make sure we find those responsible, whether you were a part or incited the riot, and it does not matter who you are or what position you hold, the department will follow up.” Woodfin said he intends to remove the large Confederate monument in Linn Park even though it will mean a $25,000 fine for the city. The cost of removing it is less than the continual costs of civil unrest if it remains, he said. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said the one-time fine is the only punishment the city faces if it removes the monument. “The Alabama Monuments Preservation Act provides a singular avenue for enforcement — the filing of a civil complaint in pursuit of a fine, which the Alabama Supreme Court has determined to be a one-time assessment of $25,000. The act authorizes no additional relief,” Marshall said. “Should the city of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today, city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the act to pursue a new civil complaint against the city.” Bessemer has also declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. for the next five days. Bessemer Mayor Kenneth Gulley cited “credible threats” against the city on social media as the reason for the protective measure. Anyone with videos or images of those who caused unrest or violence in Birmingham on Sunday is encouraged to call Crimestoppers at 205-254-7777 and share what they have.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

(WKRG) — Two people have been arrested and charged after a Mobile police vehicle was vandalized during Sunday’s protests in Mobile. Tia Pugh has been charged with inciting a riot and criminal mischief 3rd degree. Her fiance, William Mason Baucom, was charged with hindering prosecution for harboring Pugh. Pugh was caught on News 5 footage breaking a Mobile police vehicle’s window with a bat. It happened as protesters were trying to get onto I-10 downtown. Officers used tear gas to break up the crowd. Pugh is from Mobile. Mobile City Council said earlier Tuesday “outsiders” caused unrest during protests on Sunday. It is not known where Baucom is from. As she was being taken to the police car, Pugh said, “Genocide is happening…Genocide is happening we’re being murdered in the street for absolutely no reason and unarmed. We’re being disarmed when we arm ourselves.” Chief Lawrence Battiste said his department will not allow any willful destruction of property. He said, “That police vehicle was bought with taxpayer’s money and so her actions is what prompted us to get to this point.” Baucom made no comments when he was transported to jail. Watch Pugh’s comments below. Chief Battiste said MPD is creating a line it will not allow people to cross.

Monday evening’s protest over Floyd’s death was mostly peaceful. Huntsville police said they fired gas into a group after they refused to leave at the protest’s conclusion. Huntsville Police Chief Mark McMurray and Madison County Sheriff Kevin Turner are hoping for peace and are confident it’s possible because of their relationship with NAACP President Jerry Burnet. “Anything that he is a part of, I look for there to be a clean, peaceful protest,” said Sheriff Turner.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. 'When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,' Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. 'We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,' he said. 'It is time to pull people together.' Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John's Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn't mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn't comment about Trump's actions. 'Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. 'His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,' he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. 'Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn't mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,' Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn't be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest.' He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

(WIAT) — Over the last 24 hours, we’ve seen Confederate statues across the state taken down or vandalized. This comes after the attorney general is reminding cities that there is a fine associated with the removal of these monuments. During the 2018 election, Gov. Kay Ivey campaigned on the idea of protecting confederate monuments. She signed the Alabama Monuments Preservation Act into law. Today, people are protesting to have those very monuments removed. “Dr. King reminds us that rioting is the language of the voice of the unheard,” said Leica Brooks. But the message from protestors is bigger than monuments. “Just an outpouring of pain and a real call for people to pay attention and change some of these systemic issues that we that are present in the country,” said Brooks. In the last 24 hours, Birmingham removed a Confederate monument. In Montgomery, the statue of Robert E. Lee was taken down in front of the school that bears his name. And down south, a statue in Mobile was also vandalized. “He can’t leave, he is what holds us down,” said Mary Jane Elkins. “I understand that is history but at the same time, we don’t have Japanese leaders posted up where Pearl Harbor happened,” said Sean Brown. Attorney General Steve Marshall issued this statement regarding the removal of a confederate statue. “The Alabama Monuments Preservation Act provides a singular avenue for enforcement — the filing of a civil complaint in pursuit of a fine, which the Alabama Supreme Court has determined to be a one-time assessment of $25,000. The Act authorizes no additional relief.” We reached out to both Gov. Ivey and AG Marshall. They did not want to make any further comment. LATEST POSTS",0.0

The Chief and the Sheriff commended the protesters in downtown for remaining peaceful throughout the allotted time of three hours. They said people wanted to protest, and they wanted to give them a safe place for their voices to be heard. Chief McMurray said a large group showed up, it was great, and they were ready. After three hours of peaceful protesting, the leaders dismissed the crowd around 6:00 p.m. Monday night. Chief McMurray said 75-80% of the protesters left at that point, but about 170-180 people decided not to leave. “You get to a point where — how long is city services going to provide them an area that’s on a roadway, that’s not safe, businesses going on… and then they start infringing upon areas that are cornered off, where you saw the police had lined up,” said Chief McMurray. “They broke the police line. They come up, they get confrontational, get one on one with the police… and we went 90 minutes with that.” Chief McMurray said for 90 minutes, they asked for the remaining group to disband and leave, and during that time, they brought in more officers to “augment what was becoming more and more confrontational.” He said that the last thing the officers want is a confrontation. “Tensions kept getting higher and higher. They kept infringing upon the police personnel and finally, after 90 minutes, we had less than 30 minutes of daylight left, and it’s time to go home,” the Chief said. He continued on to say that he and Sheriff Turner made the decision to begin moving the crowd and escorting them to their cars. To encourage the group to leave, they deployed several “sound distractors” while asking them to move along. Chief McMurray said that lasted 30 minutes, and the group continues to be confrontational. “When they stall out, you have two options,” he continued. “You get a fork in the road at this point. What choice do you want to make? You want to take them all to jail? We could have.” Chief McMurray said the group was in violation of “lawful order,” were in “unlawful assembly,” and were blocking the roadway. “That’s called disorderly conduct, it’s called inciting a riot,” he said. “There are multiple charges that we could’ve put on over 100 people. We chose not to do that.” With it becoming dark outside, the Chief said it would become more dangerous when people couldn’t see well in the road, and law enforcement could not block the roads of downtown Huntsville indefinitely. That’s when smoke was released into the crowd, and the Chief said the group moved about 50 feet down the road, then returned again. After still not leaving the area, Chief McMurray said they “popped one can of irritant.” He called it a “CS irritant.” “That one little dose of irritant convinced everyone to go get in their car and leave, and almost everyone did at that point and it was over with,” said Chief McMurray. “So we used the least amount of force is all I’m saying.” Another peaceful protest is planned to take place in downtown Huntsville on Wednesday at Big Spring Park from 5:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m.",0.0

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

One was possession of a handgun.” Owen Marshall Eason, 25, was arrested on June 1, and charged with possessing a firearm at a demonstration. He is currently in the Madison County Metro Jail with no set bond. “At the demonstration site, we pulled two out with one of them. We arrested immediately. He had a handgun, because he was a person we’ve been looking for anyway and we identified him through officers on the ground. We went in and grabbed him because he was wanted and he had a gun on him,” said Police Chief Mark McMurray. “The other person, we saw him pull his gun out of his holster while he was in the middle of the crowd through the use of some surveillance we had, some oversight and we had some officer on the ground. We went up and grabbed him and took him out and we’re getting warrants for him right now. We actually took him off-site, had a talk with him… young kid, big mistake. We don’t see him as a threat. We don’t think he was in there to harm anyone. He was showing off. We took his gun. We’re told we are going to go back and make an arrest on him today. We needed the officers on the street for the rest of the time and for us to actually put him in jail at that time, that would have taken a couple of cops off the street, we just want to be there for the rest of them. So, we stopped that threat where it is, we can go get paperwork anytime. So basically two arrests, both of them had weapons.

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

Marshall says that action violates of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act. The lawsuit seeks additional penalties after the city lost a similar lawsuit filed by the State in 2017. The Memorial Preservation Act was passed in 2017 by the Alabama Legislature to protect architecturally significant buildings, memorial buildings, memorial streets and monuments located on public property for 40 or more years. The monument in Birmingham has been in place for 115 years. “The State of Alabama first filed suit against the City of Birmingham in 2017 after the City erected barriers around the monument in Linn Park. In November 2019, the Alabama Supreme Court sided with the State and determined that the City of Birmingham had violated the law and was subject to the Act’s penalties. However, the Court held that any violation of the Act was punishable only by a one-time fine of $25,000 per violation. Though legislation was filed in the 2020 session seeking to amend the penalties provision of the Act in response to the Court’s ruling, that legislation failed to become law,” Marshall said in a statement. The monument became the focal point of a protest in Birmingham on Sunday night over the death of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Memorial Day. A group took down the plywood barrier surrounding the base of the monument and attempted to take it down or damage it. Read the Lawsuit: State of Alabama v. City of Birmingham",0.0

The Georgia chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists said in a news release that one journalist was detained Sunday and another on Monday covering protests and unrest that has followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Both were quickly released without charges. Atlanta Journal-Constitution photographer Alyssa Pointer, a black woman, was detained by Georgia Department of Natural Resources officers Monday while wearing press credentials and after identifying herself as a journalist, the release says. Haisten Willis, a freelance journalist on assignment for The Washington Post, said he was handcuffed and briefly held by Atlanta police Sunday while trying to explain that he was a reporter. Willis is a white man. Live video of Pointer being detained was streamed by a WXIA-TV reporter. It shows Pointer sitting on the ground with her hands restrained behind her back, before being released after other journalists interceded. Kevin Riley, the editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said in a statement that Pointer was “doing her job.” “While we are still getting details of what happened, there is no acceptable reason for a working member of the media — who clearly identified herself — to be detained,” Riley said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said during a news conference Tuesday that he’s asked Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Mark Williams to “look into” Pointer’s detainment. Williams’ office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Journalists covering protests across the U.S. have complained of rough treatment by police. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was reporting live television in Minneapolis when police arrested him Friday. The following night in the same city, MSNBC host Ali Velshi said he was shot in the leg by police firing rubber bullets after his crew identified themselves as journalists. Willis said police approached him in downtown Atlanta after curfew Sunday. He said he put his hands up, telling them: “I’m a journalist.” Willis said he told officers he didn’t have a physical media ID, but had a digital credential on his cellphone. “They said a digital credential could be forged,” Willis said. Willis said officers cuffed his hands with plastic zip ties. He told them he had business cards identifying him as a freelance journalist. He said police let him go within minutes. “I understand where the police are coming from. They didn’t know who I was initially. I was out after curfew,” Willis said. “But at the same time it was quiet and I didn’t see the need to rush when I was trying to tell them who I was.” An Atlanta police spokesman declined to comment.

Lee are 'not prosecutable' at this time due to legal errors in warrants and affidavits. The Lee statue was toppled from a pedestal in front of the city's Lee High School some time Monday evening, as hundreds of protesters gathered a few miles away in downtown Montgomery. In an emailed statement, DA Daryl Bailey left the door open for prosecution in the incident but said he would await further word from the city and the Montgomery Public School Board. ""I am not making any determination as to the rightfulness or wrongfulness of these charges being filed,"" Bailey said.""I have advised the Montgomery Police Department that if the City of Montgomery and the Montgomery Public School Board desire to continue prosecution of these individuals that my office stands ready to advise on how these errors can be corrected."" Jeremy Selmar, 28, Jonathan Williams, 34, Joe Pernell, 35, and 28-year-old Maya Holley were each charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony, in connection to the statue toppling.

Bailey released the lengthy statement Tuesday night after Montgomery activists mounted a campaign to lobby law enforcement officials to drop the felony charges. More: Arrests made after Robert E. Lee High statue removed amid downtown protests The Montgomery Bail Out Fund, established earlier this spring to post bail for county inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic, posted Tuesday morning all four had been bailed out. The Bail Out Fund was one of several groups and local activists to encourage people to call District Attorney Daryl Bailey's office and ask them to drop the charges against the four. “These statues and monuments should have been removed long ago and these activists just did what the city hasn’t had the courage to do,” said Ryan Dalton, a teacher at Sidney Lanier High — another Montgomery public school named after a Confederate leader. The Montgomery Public School district on Tuesday announced the Lee statue had been moved to storage, though its pedestal bearing Lee's name was still standing outside the school. On Tuesday, it was repainted to cover up graffiti. Lashinda Carter, 42, was charged with third-degree criminal mischief about midnight in connection to the graffiti, Capt. Saba Coleman said.

Protesters on Monday night voiced strong opinions about Confederate memorials and statues. ""Montgomery full of slave trophies,” one man said, before saying the memorials ""had to come down."" The statue was unveiled in 1908, a commemoration of a white supremacist government defeated 43 years earlier. The statue was one among a spike of Confederate memorials built across the country in the early 1900s during a period of intense racial tensions in the country. A second wave of Confederate memorials were commissioned during the later Civil Rights Movement.

Dalton added that because the alleged crimes took place on MPS property, “I would also encourage MPS to actively work toward all charges being dropped and for all schools named after white supremacists to be renamed.” Montgomery protests Hundreds gathered Monday night in front of the state Capitol building in downtown Montgomery to protest police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the second downtown protest in two days. After a protest devolved in Birmingham Sunday night, Mayor Steven Reed on Monday asked Montgomerians to consider staying home this week. But the Monday night rally lasted peacefully for more than two hours, with both demonstrators and police de-escalating tense moments throughout the night. The crowd was dispersed at 10 p.m., per a city curfew enacted amid the coronavirus pandemic. Police handcuffed and led away one woman who refused to leave the area and announced a handful of later arrests throughout the city related to property crime, though there's no indication they were directly related to the downtown protest.

It’s not one we plan to repeat,” Reed said. At dusk on Tuesday, a handful of people held a candlelight vigil to pray for Floyd and ""peace"" in Montgomery.

The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would 'move into residential areas' and 'white' neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by white supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: 'It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left.' 'Usually you see this when there's an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,'said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. 'The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.' The theories about antifa "" short for 'anti-fascists' and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations "" have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in 'tips' they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho "" a rural county of 24,000 "" the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn't taper off until the sheriff's office debunked the rumor on Facebook. 'It's really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,' said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. 'When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.' Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had 'no credible information' that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren't aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn't see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. 'Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,' Clemens said. 'It was very specific: there were three busloads.' Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words 'Soros Riot Dance squad' emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don't have any words printed on them. Said Duval: 'It's frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.' ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

Lee are 'not prosecutable' at this time due to legal errors in warrants and affidavits. The Lee statue was toppled from a pedestal in front of the city's Lee High School some time Monday evening, as hundreds of protesters gathered a few miles away in downtown Montgomery. In an emailed statement, DA Daryl Bailey left the door open for prosecution in the incident but said he would await further word from the city and the Montgomery Public School Board. ""I am not making any determination as to the rightfulness or wrongfulness of these charges being filed,"" Bailey said.""I have advised the Montgomery Police Department that if the City of Montgomery and the Montgomery Public School Board desire to continue prosecution of these individuals that my office stands ready to advise on how these errors can be corrected."" Jeremy Selmar, 28, Jonathan Williams, 34, Joe Pernell, 35, and 28-year-old Maya Holley were each charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a Class C felony, in connection to the statue toppling. According to state law, a person commits the crime of first-degree criminal mischief if damages to property exceed $2,500.

Protesters and citizens across the nation have demanded Confederate memorials, built to commemorate a government resting on the principle of white supremacy, be taken down in the wake of Floyd's killing.

""There is a process when trying to settle grievances with our Government and those should be litigated in our Courts not our streets."" Bailey released the lengthy statement Tuesday night after Montgomery activists mounted a campaign to lobby law enforcement officials to drop the felony charges. More: Arrests made after Robert E. Lee High statue removed amid downtown protests The Montgomery Bail Out Fund, established earlier this spring to post bail for county inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic, posted Tuesday morning all four had been bailed out. The Bail Out Fund was one of several groups and local activists to encourage people to call District Attorney Daryl Bailey's office and ask them to drop the charges against the four. “These statues and monuments should have been removed long ago and these activists just did what the city hasn’t had the courage to do,” said Ryan Dalton, a teacher at Sidney Lanier High — another Montgomery public school named after a Confederate leader. The Montgomery Public School district on Tuesday announced the Lee statue had been moved to storage, though its pedestal bearing Lee's name was still standing outside the school. On Tuesday, it was repainted to cover up graffiti. Lashinda Carter, 42, was charged with third-degree criminal mischief about midnight in connection to the graffiti, Capt. Saba Coleman said.

(Photo: Jake Crandall/ Advertiser) Any decisions made about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, city spokesman Griffith Waller said. Protesters on Monday night voiced strong opinions about Confederate memorials and statues. ""Montgomery full of slave trophies,” one man said, before saying the memorials ""had to come down."" The statue was unveiled in 1908, a commemoration of a white supremacist government defeated 43 years earlier. The statue was one among a spike of Confederate memorials built across the country in the early 1900s during a period of intense racial tensions in the country. A second wave of Confederate memorials were commissioned during the later Civil Rights Movement.

Later it was moved closer to Ann Street along Madison Avenue before moving to the school in 1960, five years after the then all-white school was opened.

Jefferson Davis should be renamed; Robert E. Lee should be renamed; Sidney Lanier should be renamed,"" Dalton said. Dalton added that because the alleged crimes took place on MPS property, “I would also encourage MPS to actively work toward all charges being dropped and for all schools named after white supremacists to be renamed.” Montgomery protests Hundreds gathered Monday night in front of the state Capitol building in downtown Montgomery to protest police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the second downtown protest in two days. After a protest devolved in Birmingham Sunday night, Mayor Steven Reed on Monday asked Montgomerians to consider staying home this week. But the Monday night rally lasted peacefully for more than two hours, with both demonstrators and police de-escalating tense moments throughout the night. The crowd was dispersed at 10 p.m., per a city curfew enacted amid the coronavirus pandemic. Police handcuffed and led away one woman who refused to leave the area and announced a handful of later arrests throughout the city related to property crime, though there's no indication they were directly related to the downtown protest. More: Police arrest six, respond to a dozen calls of damage, stolen property following Monday protest Reed credited Finley and Montgomery Police officers for taking their Monday approach, which included expanding the protest zone multiple times to allow protesters to demonstrate. He said “there are those that believe you have to meet peaceful protesters with forceful tactics,” but that’s not the path Montgomery chooses to take. “We’ve learned that lesson generations ago. It’s not one we plan to repeat,” Reed said. At dusk on Tuesday, a handful of people held a candlelight vigil to pray for Floyd and ""peace"" in Montgomery. Though police again blocked off Dexter Avenue in anticipation of protesters, fewer officers manned the barricade and few demonstrators were present.

Reed, the city’s first black mayor, said minorities have been dealing with those kinds of anxieties for a lot longer than the past few days and they deserve a chance to raise their voice. More: Montgomery mayor pledges to work with protesters, make changes “That’s what I heard yesterday, that there are people who live with the strain and the trauma of having to be concerned about how they’re going to be perceived not only by the police in the community, but others,” he said. “We’re standing in the city of a protest that was supposed to be one day and lasted 381 more days. So, I don’t know when this protest is over. We’ll work with the protesters as long as we need to work with them. If it’s three more days, or if it’s 300 more days we’ll work with them and we’ll make sure we make the changes that need to be made. That’s how we got this far.” Read Bailey's full statement here “Racism has no place in our society. I recognize that our nation, our state and most especially our city has a complicated and often deplorable history in relation to race and racial equality. I know that the sins of our past will dictate our future if we do not continue to push for change. I want to make clear that as your District Attorney, I am charged with seeking justice. It is my honor and my duty to do so. In these difficult times it is imperative that the law be administered fairly, accurately, and impartially. This morning the Montgomery Police Department filed charges against four Montgomery citizens for taking down a statue of Robert E. Lee that was displayed at the entrance of Robert E. Lee High School. I have reviewed the warrants and affidavits and have found them to contain legal errors that would make the crimes for which these four have been charged not prosecutable. I am not making any determination as to rightfulness or wrongfulness of these charges being filed. I have advised the Montgomery Police Department that if the City of Montgomery and the Montgomery Public School Board desire to continue prosecution of these individuals that my office stands ready to advise on how these errors can be corrected. This decision should not be seen or interpreted as endorsing citizens taking the law into their own hands. There is a process when trying to settle grievances with our Government and those should be litigated in our Courts not our streets. I firmly believe that if these individuals had opened dialogue with City and County leaders that they would have listened and done everything in their power to address these concerns in a lawful manner. I want to thank those who have protested in Montgomery for remaining peaceful. They have every right to protest and to demand change in their government. However, these protests must remain calm, peaceful, and safe as they have up to this point. We must continue to search for ways to have productive conversations coupled with action to move our community forward. We must refrain from activities that stifle progress and are criminal. I am dedicated now more than ever to being an accessible, fair-minded District Attorney, community leader and community servant. We will fail as a society if we do not learn to love each other and live together peacefully. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.” Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Melissa Brown at 334-240-0132 or mabrown@gannett.com.

There had been at least 90 protesters there shortly before, but the others obeyed police warnings and left shortly before 7 p.m. There were about 50 Hoover police officers at the scene, and the protesters did not resist arrest when officers approached them. They were loaded onto a vehilce without incident. The protesters claim police in America have a pattern of treating minorities unfairly. Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato enacted the curfew, which is in effect from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., on Monday, saying he felt it necessary to protect Hoover residents, visitors and businesses from harm and losses following civil unrest and destruction that occurred on Saturday and Sunday nights, Brocato said people in Hoover are shocked and saddened at the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week and the manner in which it occurred, and the implications of that has had far-reaching impacts on cities throughout the country. The mayor said he wants to seek justice and bring peace and safety to all citizens, regardless of their race, creed or national origin, and he stands in full support of citizens who want to express their First Amendment right to peacefully demonstrate and protest. However, city officials must protect individuals and businesses from “senseless destruction by criminal mob actions.” Birmingham experienced significant rioting and vandalism in its downtown area Sunday night, and at least two news reporters were assaulted. Hoover police Chief Nick Derzis said that while most of the protesting that has occurred in Hoover in the past few days has been peaceful, there have been some issues. Police had bottles of water, bottles of urine and eggs thrown at them during protests, and one police officer was injured in one of the protests, Derzis said. Two retail stores — the Jared jewelry store and Von Maur department store on the Riverchase Galleria campus— had glass doors and/or windows smashed Saturday night. The civil unrest threatens the life, safety, health, welfare and property of people in the city of Hoover, Brocato said.",0.0

But for the family and friends of retired Captain David Dorm, who was murdered last night after retiring from the sale of City Police Department in 2007 doored became police chief in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency.

No arrests have been made.The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt.

He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

As protesters march side by side, they risked spreading and contracting the virus that can now infect thousands of households. COVID-19 testing sites may also not be accessible, limiting diagnoses of the deadly disease. Marchers, some not wearing masks, can be seen chanting, and in some cases screaming, during protests and demonstrations this week. “When people are yelling or speaking in a loud voice, you do have more projection of saliva. And with that, potentially (the) virus,” Chicago Public Health Department’s Dr. Allison Arwady said. Packed-in, moving crowds also do not allow protesters to stay a safe distance away from each other. “One of the reasons we always make that 6-foot recommendation and have the cloth face covering recommendation, is those are the two best ways to prevent transmission,” Arwady said. Now, before mass infections spread, health experts and officials in cities like Chicago are urging anyone who participated in the protest to self isolate. “Please, in exercising your First Amendment rights, or if you were out for any other reason, you have now put yourself at risk and we need you to isolate yourself,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We need you to think about, and be conscious of, whether you are experiencing any signs or symptoms.” “My worry is that we’ve already seen this so disproportionately impact black and brown communities in Chicago,” Arwady said. “What I want is for all of us, especially those communities, is to get on the other side of COVID here. And so if people can do these things that help keep themselves safe, help keep their close contacts safe, it’s in the best interest of them and then really the whole city.” Protesters are urged to stay far away from their family member in high coronavirus risk due to diabetes, heart disease, asthma, age or obesity. “I really want people to recognize that over these next 14 days … I don’t want you in close contact with people who have those underlying conditions or people who are over 60 because you have a higher potential than you did previously to spread it,” Arwady said. “Nothing has changed about COVID and the problem is the virus doesn’t care what else is going on. The virus is just looking for opportunities to spread.” Testing in Chicago was halted Monday – even for people with symptoms – as the Illinois Department of public health was concerned about staff and potential patient safety. However, the city of Chicago has plenty of testing sites through hospitals and clinics. If you have symptoms, the message is, “Get tested.” LATEST STORIES",0.0

New Orleans – Their words are as full of outrage as the words of any other protesters around the nation. But hundreds of protesters continue to gather and march in New Orleans, peacefully, for a fourth straight night. The protests are organized by “Taken Em Down NOLA,” a group of civil rights activists who united during Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s 2015 initiative to remove Confederate monuments from city property. Since Saturday, May 30, the group has gathered each evening at 6 pm at Duncan Plaza, across from City Hall. There, they’ve been joined by hundreds of fellow activists– and onlookers– to demand justice for all black Americans after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Last night the group marched from Duncan Plaza and into the narrow streets of the French Quarter and back again, chanting slogans and waving signs. There were no reports of any violence or destruction of property. NOPD Superintendent Sheaun Ferguson wants to keep it that way. Today in a news conference, Ferguson used the phrase that’s become common among law enforcement regarding the Floyd protests: “outside agitators.” Ferguson claims outsiders have caused the violence in other cities, and he won’t allow it in New Orleans. He urged anyone who wants to join a local protest to prevent the movement from being co-opted by those agitators. “Don’t take the bait,” said Ferguson. “Our city has truly been a great example of how to voice your concerns without violence.” LATEST STORIES",0.0

Or cause a big disturbance for God’s sake for that matter so I decided – and agreed with the chief as well – we’re just gonna stay right here along Airport,” said Miller. “So I told them they can protest from this lot, but we will not support them in a march from this location,” said Battiste.

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

While marching, the protesters were encouraged with honks and cheers from passing motorists. Protesters held signs and chanted slogans like “Black Lives Matter,” “Hands up, Don’t shoot” and “Say his name.” Miller said he organized the demonstration because he believed the issue deserved more than one day of attention in Mobile. He said the group wants to see reforms in the way police detain people. The overall message was they wanted to respect the police and keep the event peaceful, he said. “We have to be heard,” Miller said. “We must be heard.”",0.0

Bailey has shared his thoughts regarding the charges filed against the four Montgomery citizens who took down a statue of Robert E. Lee that was displayed at the entrance of Robert E. Lee HighSchool the following is DA Bailey’s statement: “Racism has no place in our society. I recognize that our nation, our state and most especially our city has a complicated and often deplorable history in relation to race and racial equality. I know that the sins of our past will dictate our future if we do not continue to push for change. I want to make clear that as your District Attorney, I am charged with seeking justice. It is my honor and my duty to do so. In these difficult times it is imperative that the law be administered fairly, accurately, and impartially. This morning the Montgomery Police Department filed charges against four Montgomery citizens for taking down a statue of Robert E. Lee that was displayed at the entrance of Robert E. Lee High School. I have reviewed the warrants and affidavits and have found them to contain legal errors that would make the crimes for which these four have been charged not prosecutable. I am not making any determination as to rightfulness or wrongfulness of these charges being filed. I have advised the Montgomery Police Department that if the City of Montgomery and the Montgomery Public School Board desire to continue prosecution of these individuals that my office stands ready to advise on how these errors can be corrected. This decision should not be seen or interpreted as endorsing citizens taking the law into their own hands. There is a process when trying to settle grievances with our Government and those should be litigated in our Courts not our streets. I firmly believe that if these individuals had opened dialogue with City and County leaders that they would have listened and done everything in their power to address these concerns in a lawful manner. I want to thank those who have protested in Montgomery for remaining peaceful. They have every right to protest and to demand change in their government. However, these protests must remain calm, peaceful, and safe as they have up to this point. We must continue to search for ways to have productive conversations coupled with action to move our community forward. We must refrain from activities that stifle progress and are criminal. I am dedicated now more than ever to being an accessible, fair-minded District Attorney, community leader and community servant. We will fail as a society if we do not learn to love each other and live together peacefully. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”",0.0

The downtown Birmingham business was damaged by protesters in the early hours of June 1. (Jessica Ingram) By Caleb Yarbrough Correspondent, The Alabama Baptist Businesses were burned and looted and monuments were vandalized when protests over the killing of George Floyd turned violent in the early hours of Monday, June 1. What started as a peaceful gathering in Linn Park on May 31 escalated when protesters vandalized a statue of Charles Linn, a Finnish-born seafarer who immigrated to Alabama in 1838 and served as a captain in the Confederate States’ Navy. Among the businesses damaged were Alabama Power, People’s Bank of Alabama, The California Fashion Mall and The Alabama Theatre. Wheelhouse Salon, which is located across the street from The Alabama Theatre, had its storefront windows shattered. Looters ransacked and robbed the business. Among the items stolen were iPad-based cash registers and computers. Johnny Grimes is the owner of Wheelhouse Salon. (Read more about the Birmingham business by clicking here.) Damage reported Grimes was asleep when one of his employees from Wheelhouse called and woke him with news of the riots. After hearing the news, he pulled up security footage from the salon from his home where at one point he saw members of Birmingham’s SWAT team enter and clear Wheelhouse’s building. After watching from home and waiting there until he felt it was safe, Grimes went to the salon, surveyed the damage and began securing the store. While he and an employee began cleaning up, Grimes saw rioters set fire to The California Fashion Mall, which is located down the street from Wheelhouse. Grimes and other employees boarded up Wheelhouse’s broken windows and cleaned up the mess left by the rioters on June 1. The store was only closed for one day, however, and reopened – while still in ill repair – on June 2. “We felt that it was important to get back open as soon as possible,” said Grimes. ‘Actions won’t deter us’ Grimes said the decision to reopen quickly was necessary due to the recent financial constrains related to COVID-19. He emphasized that he and Wheelhouse’s staff care deeply about Birmingham and believe that the recent riots do not reflect the values of the city. “I felt the need to stand up and say, ‘These types of actions don’t define us and they aren’t going to deter us. We are Birmingham and we are going to stand united with our African-American brothers and sisters,’” said Grimes. “We are going to open up and we are going to continue to serve the community.” Recent rioting and looting not only does not represent Birmingham as a city, but it does not represent the movement to highlight injustices perpetrated on George Floyd, said Grimes. Grimes said that he hopes and prays that, while the riots were unjust, that they did not happen “for nothing.” National conversation needed “(I hope) that it does spark a national conversation that’s based around racial reconciliation, but also how African-Americans are treated in our country and police brutality,” he said. “Our windows can be replaced. Our iPads can be replaced. Our Square registers can be replaced. Our computers can be replaced. What can’t be replaced is the life of George Floyd,” said Grimes. “And so I understand. I understand the rage and the frustration that the African-American community is feeling. I identify with it. I sympathize with it. “I just hope that this leads to a greater conversation that actually produces change in our country,” he said. State of emergency declared Following the night’s events, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin issued a state of emergency for Birmingham and an indefinite nightly curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., with exceptions for “medical service, food or other essential needs … (and) essential workers,” according to Woodfin. In a June 1 press conference, the mayor said that he supports civil disobedience but that that “is very different from civil unrest.” “I support activism, and your right to peacefully assemble, but I don’t support mobs and people destroying things just because,” said Woodfin. “Birmingham, this is not us. This is not who we are. This is not how we taught the world how to protest,” said Woodfin. “Violence, looting and chaos is not the road to reform, and anybody that is doing the looting, anybody that’s breaking things just because, anybody that’s setting fires just because — I want to make this very clear to you, you’re not doing that in the name of reform or George Floyd, you’re on a different agenda that the City of Birmingham will not tolerate,” he said. “And I want to make this clear. You don’t get a second chance at it,” said Woodfin. “That means no more parades, no vigils, no more demonstrations.” ‘Not the way’ Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that she “was shocked and angered by the tragic actions that led to the senseless death of George Floyd,” in a June 1 statement. Ivey denounced the rioting and destruction of property. “It is a death that should have never happened and it is a tragedy for which that too many people, especially African Americans, are all too familiar,” said Ivey. “Regretfully, the natural anger and frustration of Mr. Floyd’s death has now spread to our state and what started out as peaceful protests in some of our cities yesterday afternoon turned ugly last night. “While no state has a richer history than Alabama in terms of using peaceful protests to lead the country — and the world — to positive change, I agree with Alabama native, Congressman John Lewis, who this weekend said ‘rioting, looting and burning is not the way,’” she said. While she “will always support the right of the people of Alabama to peacefully lift your voices in anger and frustration,” Ivey said that she “will not allow our cities to become a target for those, especially from other states, who choose to use violence and destruction to make their point.” Regarding the riots in Birmingham, Ivey said such behavior was “unbecoming” of the city and an affront to “all those who have worked to make Birmingham the great city it is.” Ivey announced that she had given authorization to activate up to 1,000 National Guard guardsmen to respond to violent protests should the need arise. “While there is no immediate need for us to deploy our Guard, I have given authorization to Adjutant General Sheryl Gordon to be on standby, should our local and state law enforcement need additional support,” said Ivey. Commitment to justice In an evening press conference June 1, President Donald Trump addressed recent riots across the country. “All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family that justice will be served — he will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob,” said Trump. Grimes and Wheelhouse Salon plan to create a GoFundMe site to raise money to repair their salon, as well as other businesses damaged during the riots.

COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. ___ UNITED NATIONS "" The president of the U.N. Economic and Social Council is calling for urgent action to help the growing number of countries already facing or at risk of 'debt distress' because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Norway's U.N. Ambassador Mona Juul, head of the 54-nation U.N. body, told a meeting Tuesday on financing for the coronavirus crisis and recovery that the decision by the world's 20 major economic powers to freeze debt service payments for the world's poorest countries through the end of the year isn't enough. She said the Group of 20's suspension will free about $11 billion until the end of the year, but it's estimated that eligible countries have an additional $20 billion in multilateral and commercial debt combined coming due this year. Juul said that means even if the moratorium is extended to 2021, 'many countries will have to make difficult choices between servicing their debt, fighting the pandemic, and investing in recovery.' ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: "" Protest of police use-of-force held in Paris despite virus ban "" Mayor says Chicago will proceed with easing lockdown despite vandalism, protests "" Kenya prosecutor orders arrest of officer in death of boy shot during curfew "" While the World Health Organization publicly praised China in January for its speedy response to the then-new coronavirus, the U.N. health agency was frustrated behind the scenes by China's delays in sharing information needed to fight the spread of the virus, The Associated Press has found. "" Some British lawmakers were not pleased about going back to the office as the country eased restrictions from the virus outbreak. Some in Parliament, who have largely been working from home, say the government's decision to scrap a remote-voting system used during the pandemic will turn those who must stay home because of age, illness or family issues into second-class lawmakers.

All but one of the new cases were reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where hundreds of infections have been linked to entertainment venues, church gatherings and a massive e-commerce warehouse. Mayors and governors in the greater capital area have shut thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars, karaoke rooms, churches and wedding halls to slow the spread of the virus. But despite the spike in transmissions, the government has been pushing ahead with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high-school seniors on May 20. Class openings were planned Wednesday for nearly 1.8 million children -- high school freshmen, middle-school juniors and third - and fourth-grade elementary school kids. ___ BEIJING "" China on Wednesday reported reported four new confirmed coronavirus cases, one brought from abroad and three added retroactively after nucleic acid tests returned positive results.

The demonstration in Paris and similar protests in other French cities on Tuesday were organized to honor Frenchman Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016 and to support Americans demonstrating against the death of George Floyd' in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Paris police banned the gathering a few hours before it was supposed to start, citing virus restrictions forbidding gatherings of more than 10 people. The circumstances of Traore's death are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports.

Total confirmed cases now number 233,515, although authorities say many people with mild symptoms may have had the virus but never underwent testing. Italy also reported 55 more virus-related deaths in the same 24-hour period, raising the national death toll from the pandemic to 33,530. Since many elderly people who died during the outbreak in nursing homes or in their own homes weren't tested, authorities acknowledge that the actual death toll is likely much higher.

Italy also will start allowing in tourists from most of Europe. ___ KARACHI, Pakistan -- Two Pakistani lawmakers have died after testing positive for the coronavirus amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The leader of the so-called Orange Vests told the protest crowd assembled in the Piazza del Popolo on Tuesday that children shouldn't be made to wear masks and he threatened to ''slap'' anyone who did. Antonio Pappalardo added that he refuses to wear a mask himself and said: ''These lungs mine. I will take care of my lungs. Breathing is sacred.''

Koike said: 'The alert is to precisely inform the people of the status of infections and to advise caution.' Lighting on Tokyo's Rainbow Bridge will be changed from rainbow-colored to red as a sign of alert. However, the alert does not mean restrictions that just got eased will be reimposed immediately.

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported to Putin on Tuesday that the Cabinet's plan contains measures designed to stimulate economic growth, raise incomes and reduce unemployment. It envisages spending 5 trillion rubles (about $73 billion) until December 2021. A partial economic shutdown that Putin ordered in late March to stem the country's outbreak badly hurt an economy already battered by a sharp drop in oil prices. The Russian leader says the nation is now past the peak of contagion, allowing regional officials to gradually ease the restrictions. However, some experts warned that a daily increase of about 9,000 confirmed cases makes a quick lifting of the lockdown dangerous. ____ LONDON "" A leading epidemiologist said the coronavirus outbreak in the U.K. is unlikely to worsen during the summer but that the outlook from September was 'very unclear.' Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said he expects levels of coronavirus transmissions and cases to 'remain relatively flat between now and September, short of very big policy changes or behavior changes in the community.' He told a committee of lawmakers in the House of Lords on Tuesday that the 'real uncertainty' will be in September. Ferguson resigned from his position as a government adviser last month after revelations that he broke social-distancing rules. A coronavirus lockdown is being eased across the U.K., most quickly in England, raising concerns among many health officials of a potential second spike in infections. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said.

Birmingham mayor Randall Woodfin participated in the organized rally, ""Birmingham, the World is Watching,"" at Kelly Ingram Park downtown. The rally itself, according to media outlets on the scene, was peaceful and non-violent. However, protests elsewhere in the city and surrounding communities spilled over into Birmingham which resulted in a much less peaceful outcome, including an attempt to tear down the Confederate monument in Linn Park that has caused controversy in recent years. Woodfin was able to get the protesters in Linn Park to leave, saying he would ""finish the job"" by Tuesday, but added that if the crowd continued to vandalize the monument, police would get involved, according to an al.com report. ""I understand the frustration and the anger that you have,"" he said. ""Allow me to finish the job for you."" Meanwhile, protesters throughout the city damaged the Regions Harbert Plaza, the Alabama Power Museum, Alabama Theatre and other buildings downtown. A Facebook video of some of the damage can be seen here. Woodfin addressed the protesters in a public statement, saying, ""Many of you all have a right to be very angry right now. You have a right to be sad,"" Woodfin said. ""You don't have a right to walk around busting windows, setting things on fire. Damaging people's property. Looting. Taking things that don't belong to you. That makes you a hijacker of a peaceful rally."" Woodfin made his plea via Facebook Sunday night:",0.0

The incident is one of six cases being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) into alleged excessive use of force on black men and a teenager in the last four months. Trevaile Wyse, 30, said he had just arrived home from work in February when there was a car crash in the street outside his house. He went out to see what had happened and found himself targeted by police officers. Image: Trevaile Wyse claims the officer was 'fixated' on him ""The police officer had chased some lads off down the road and he turned around with his Taser drawn and ran back up the road and told me to get on the ground. ""I refused to get on the ground because there was no reason for me to get on the ground. Advertisement ""And then he just fired the Taser which hit me in the throat."" He believes there's only one reason he was targeted. ""By that specific officer I personally believe it was because I was black. There could have been no other reason for it. He was fixated on me. ""There were other people around, you know, standing next to me. He didn't order them to get on the ground. I believe it's because I was black."" :: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker The incident was captured on a mobile phone. Footage of a separate incident involving West Midlands Police officers shows a black man being slammed into the bonnet of a police car and punched three times. The IOPC are also looking at a stop-and-search of a 15-year-old, where the boy was kicked and hit and an incident where a man's ankle was fractured. The chief constable of West Midlands Police, Dave Thompson, has said the independent investigation into six cases should give the community confidence, but writing on a blog following the death of George Floyd in the US, he said: ""I think this has added to tensions we are now policing here. ""Young black people across the West Midlands will rightly feel strongly about these events and the fact they are in the US makes no difference. ""They affect how policing is seen on our streets."" Assistant chief constable Matt Ward told Sky News he is concerned that he has colleagues in the force who treat black people differently when they are arresting. ""If there are those colleagues I want them out of this organisation,"" he said. ""I don't want to be part of an organisation that they're a part of and the vast majority of officers and staff at West Midlands police don't want them to be a part of this organisation either."" People in Birmingham held a demonstration to show their anger over the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old who died after being restrained by police in Minneapolis. Desmond Jaddoo, a community leader in the city, said there is a danger trust in police here has been damaged too. ""Policing is a relationship between the police, in terms of policing by consent and the community,"" he said. ""Trust and confidence is absolutely crucial and I think trust and confidence is at its lowest right now and within this current climate what's happening across in America is only exacerbating community relations."" The IOPC confirmed that four of the six incidents being investigated in Birmingham involve one officer who has been suspended by West Midlands Police. Two of the investigations under way are scrutinising the actions of officers who were in supervisory roles when those incidents took place. The West Midlands regional director for the IOPC Derrick Campbell said: ""I would like to reassure communities in the West Midlands that full, fair and thorough independent investigations are under way into all of these incidents and the conduct matters brought to our attention by the force.""",0.0

Another protest - billed by organisers to be “peaceful and social-distanced” - is also planned in Victoria Square, Birmingham city centre on Thursday, June 4 from 4pm. A huge demonstration also took part in London on Sunday where they marched holding signs reading “Justice for George” and “Rest in power”.",0.0

The peaceful rally was one of several taking place this week in mostly-white suburbs of Birmingham. The crowd was diverse, with a large number of white and young people in attendance. Some held signs that read “white silence is consent” and “white silence is violence.” Hoover-area resident Emma Wilson, 23, who is white, said she invited several of her friends to attend the Alabama Rally Against Injustice, but they declined over safety concerns. “I did tell each of them the discomfort that you’re feeling right now is something that people of color have to feel all the time,” she said. “The issue is, again, other people have to fear for their safety all the time, and we as white people — I do feel that we do need to put ourselves in those positions of uncomfort and really sit with that for a minute.” Birmingham resident Toby Wanyeki said he’s attended several rallies to protest the police killing of George Floyd, but this one had a different flavor. “Pretty big turnout, very diverse, definitely a whiter crowd, allieship, which is always welcome,” he said. Organizers staged a powerful re-enactment of Floyd’s death at the hands of a police officer. Those in attendance lied face down on the ground with their hands behind their backs for more than eight minutes, as Floyd did when he died. A speaker repeatedly cried Floyd’s last words: “Mama – I can’t breathe.” Many in the crowd sobbed. Lydia Walker of Birmingham was among them. “As I lay there on the ground, I was in tears,” she said. “I felt everybody’s pain here.” She said being surrounded by white people as they experienced the same grief gave her a sense of unity. The location was significant, she said. “The fact that we’re in Homewood, the fact that we’re organizing in white spaces, that’s what needs to happen.” She said Birmingham is known to be a progressive city. People in the suburbs, she said, must also be attuned to injustices against African Americans. Her friend, Becki Delgado, said the exercise was healing. “We needed to just cry it out and empathize with one another and just cry together,” she said. “I think that really solidified the direction that we’re going in.” Onoyemi Williams, with the community organizing group Faith in Action Alabama, said the location was intentional. “The importance of organizing in white spaces stems from the situation often times that injuries that are sustained by African Americans are taking place in white spaces,” Williams said. She said African Americans in Homewood complain that they’re followed and ticketed more aggressively, and that young people are often apprehended by police with questionable justification. But young people, she said, co-mingle more with people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds than older generations. Parents, she said, are starting to follow their childrens’ example. “More and more communities that are white are starting to pay attention,” she said. After the rally, law enforcement officials detained two people who police said they believed to be “agitators.” The FBI, the Birmingham Police Department, and the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department were involved. Both people were released. Homewood Police Chief Tim Ross said his office acted on intelligence that the rally could be infiltrated by people who could take over the peaceful demonstration and commit acts of violence. “And I expressed to the organizer of this event at the very beginning that that’s why we were here,” he said. “We didn’t want that to happen.” Also Tuesday, a group protested in Hoover near the city’s municipal complex. Several people were arrested for violating Jefferson County’s new 7 p.m. curfew. Alabama Rally Against Injustice will hold protests in Vestavia Hills Wednesday and Mountain Brook Thursday.",0.0

""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and their huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, where a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. SEATTLE — Leaders in Seattle seeking to address concerns raised by protesters have abruptly ended a city-wide curfew in place for days amid massive demonstrations against the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota.Mayor Jenny Durkan said Wednesday evening on Twitter that she was ending the curfew, which had been scheduled to last until Saturday, after she and Police Chief Carmen Best met with community members.“Chief Best believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew,” Durkan said. “For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate. We want you to continue making your voice heard.”Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear.Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course.“Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted.WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it.Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd.

The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody.

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

""You have to dominate,"" Trump ordered the governors in audio of a Monday call obtained by several news outlets, or ""you're gonna look like a bunch of jerks.""

It is all about central authority and top-down orders in a chain of command. Protesters, peaceful and otherwise, wind up at the wrong end of that chain. Even in calmer times, Trump has often spoken of having military parades in Washington, such as on his Inauguration Day or the Fourth of July, in the style of those held by the French on the Champs-Elysées or the Russians on Red Square. And when it comes to leadership heroes, we got a reminder of at least two of them over this past weekend, when the president on Twitter took off after the embattled mayor of the city where George Floyd was killed. ""Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas MacArthur or great fighter George Patton."" Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton. How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats? Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones). STRENGTH! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 It might seem a curious comparison, but Trump has long used the two World War II generals as his rhetorical standard for toughness. He invoked their names at his rallies as far back as the 2016 campaign. MacArthur, sometimes called ""American Caesar,"" was the Army commander against Japan in World War II. Patton was a cantankerous, controversial combat commander in the war against Nazi Germany. Both were known for being flamboyant, imperious and ambitious. It may or may not have occurred to Trump, as he confronted protests in Washington, that MacArthur led, and Patton took part in, the 1932 cavalry assault that cleared the bonus marchers from the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The so-called ""Bonus Army"" consisted of World War I veterans who had come from all over the country, seeking their promised benefits in the depths of the Great Depression. It was a long time ago, long before either cellphones or videotape. But it was very much a show of force, an assertion of law and order, not unlike what the president seemed to be advocating in the current civil unrest. Trump might also have had a thought, as he strode across Lafayette Square of the famous photographs of MacArthur returning to the Philippines in 1944, making good on his vow to do so when forced to evacuate at the start of the war. That iconic image shows MacArthur and entourage splashing through the surf from a landing craft to the beach, his corncob pipe clenched in his teeth. The photo this produced was so good it was rumored to have been staged, and in fact MacArthur did reenact it when landing later on another island. It has also been noticed that it resembles a picture Patton publicized of himself coming ashore in the invasion of Sicily in 1943. In any event, MacArthur's return is one of the most famous and reproduced photos of that war, and well known to every schoolboy who grew up in the postwar years. Many carried this epitome of valor and virility well into adulthood. And such images influence ideas about power and politics that have long prevailed. ""Too often, those who seek ascendancy over their colleagues in government and try to dominate them are regarded as strong, and by that very token, successful,"" writes the Oxford emeritus professor of politics Archie Brown, ""and those who work within a more collective leadership are deemed to be weak and less successful."" In his book, The Myth of the Strong Leader, Brown quotes an American scholar of government, the late Hugh Heclo, and his suggestion that presidents can bring other people together to solve problems, producing ""a more subtle and productive form of leadership [than the] hyped-up kind of 'follow me' drama"" seen on movies and TV. Something like that alternative has been modeled in recent days by officials and other civic leaders at all levels in cities around the country — often at considerable risk. They have tried to understand and mediate, whether in the street or in the meeting rooms of power. In either setting, it is easy to get caught in the middle, to be accused at once of doing too much and too little. Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields won plaudits for wading in among the protesters on Friday, expressing empathy and listening. But after the weekend protests included violence and looting, Shields was being faulted for being ""soft"" — while also being criticized when some of her officers made rough arrests to enforce curfew. Like the mayors and other police chiefs, Shields was trying to be aware of the protesters' grievances without ceding to those who had more destructive agendas. There have been stories and video of officers talking and even kneeling with peaceful protesters. And there are voices raised in many places to contradict those who would judge all protesters by those who exploit the moment to commit crimes. There have also been those who have risked much by joining the protest, each in their own way. One notable case was that of the top-ranking enlisted man in the Air Force, Chief Master Kaleth Wright, who took to Twitter to express his outrage. ""Who am I? I am a Black man who happens to be the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. I am George Floyd,"" Wright said. Who am I?  I am a Black man who happens to be the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.  I am George Floyd…I am Philando Castile, I am Michael Brown, I am Alton Sterling, I am Tamir Rice.  (1) pic.twitter.com/KuVpPkAjcm — Kaleth O. Wright (@cmsaf18) June 1, 2020 Another prominent voice was immediately heard excoriating the president's video moment on the square and in front of St. John's. It was that of Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. ""He did not come to pray,"" Budde told NPR's Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep. ""He did not seek to unify our country but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus ... and the gospel texts ... represent."" On Tuesday, the president moved on to the shrine honoring Saint John Paul II, laying a wreath in his memory. That got him a sharp rebuke from the archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese who didn't want the shrine ""so egregiously misused and manipulated."" This is more than mild pushback, and these reactions must strike the commander-in-chief as surprising. They surely do not fit the command-and-control paradigm, or at least as this president imagines it. But there is reason to think that even the contemporary military has moved on from the paradigm the president imagines. Perhaps in the next phase of our national life, whenever that comes, something more collaborative and encompassing will not seem strange or suspicious as a style of leadership. If so, there could still be some good to take from the trauma and travails of 2020. ",0.0

In any event, MacArthur's return is one of the most famous and reproduced photos of that war, and well known to every schoolboy who grew up in the postwar years. Many carried this epitome of valor and virility well into adulthood. And such images influence ideas about power and politics that have long prevailed. ""Too often, those who seek ascendancy over their colleagues in government and try to dominate them are regarded as strong, and by that very token, successful,"" writes the Oxford emeritus professor of politics Archie Brown, ""and those who work within a more collective leadership are deemed to be weak and less successful."" In his book, The Myth of the Strong Leader, Brown quotes an American scholar of government, the late Hugh Heclo, and his suggestion that presidents can bring other people together to solve problems, producing ""a more subtle and productive form of leadership [than the] hyped-up kind of 'follow me' drama"" seen on movies and TV. Something like that alternative has been modeled in recent days by officials and other civic leaders at all levels in cities around the country — often at considerable risk. They have tried to understand and mediate, whether in the street or in the meeting rooms of power. In either setting, it is easy to get caught in the middle, to be accused at once of doing too much and too little. Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields won plaudits for wading in among the protesters on Friday, expressing empathy and listening. But after the weekend protests included violence and looting, Shields was being faulted for being ""soft"" — while also being criticized when some of her officers made rough arrests to enforce curfew. Like the mayors and other police chiefs, Shields was trying to be aware of the protesters' grievances without ceding to those who had more destructive agendas. There have been stories and video of officers talking and even kneeling with peaceful protesters. And there are voices raised in many places to contradict those who would judge all protesters by those who exploit the moment to commit crimes. There have also been those who have risked much by joining the protest, each in their own way. One notable case was that of the top-ranking enlisted man in the Air Force, Chief Master Kaleth Wright, who took to Twitter to express his outrage. ""Who am I? I am a Black man who happens to be the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. I am George Floyd,"" Wright said. Who am I?  I am a Black man who happens to be the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.  I am George Floyd…I am Philando Castile, I am Michael Brown, I am Alton Sterling, I am Tamir Rice.  (1) pic.twitter.com/KuVpPkAjcm — Kaleth O. Wright (@cmsaf18) June 1, 2020 Another prominent voice was immediately heard excoriating the president's video moment on the square and in front of St. John's. It was that of Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. ""He did not come to pray,"" Budde told NPR's Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep. ""He did not seek to unify our country but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus ... and the gospel texts ... represent."" On Tuesday, the president moved on to the shrine honoring Saint John Paul II, laying a wreath in his memory. That got him a sharp rebuke from the archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese who didn't want the shrine ""so egregiously misused and manipulated."" This is more than mild pushback, and these reactions must strike the commander-in-chief as surprising. They surely do not fit the command-and-control paradigm, or at least as this president imagines it. But there is reason to think that even the contemporary military has moved on from the paradigm the president imagines. Perhaps in the next phase of our national life, whenever that comes, something more collaborative and encompassing will not seem strange or suspicious as a style of leadership. If so, there could still be some good to take from the trauma and travails of 2020. ",0.0

For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to fundamentally reconsider what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions, is that they have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new, it's just the intensity of it compared to, let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday.

Other categories include Therapy Dogs; Service Dogs; Military Dogs; Law Enforcement Dogs; Shelter Dogs; and Guide/Hearing Dogs. Indeed, the name Küsse – German for “kisses” – fits Corey Speegle ’s rescue dog to a “T.” With her innate ability to find lost people, Küsse has earned huge praise during her short career. A mom’s reaction to being reunited with her lost child – found by Küsse, a German Shepherd rescue dog – was to smother both with kisses and hugs. Küsse and Speegle live in Sheffield, Alabama, and she’s the only dog representing the Yellowhammer State. Supporters can vote for Küsse once a day through July 16. Training the nation’s ‘top dog’ Speegle got Küsse as a pup and began training her at a year old. Küsse’s innate ability to find individuals has primed her to win the national contest this fall, which concludes with a gala and a two-hour special on the Hallmark Channel. “Küsse is a beautiful dog, and she loves to serve and help find missing people,” said Speegle, state coordinator for the Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons and a volunteer firefighter for Spring Valley and White Oak Volunteer Fire departments. “Her mother is a German Shepherd from the Czech Republic and the father is a second-generation explosives dog out of Fort Hood, Texas.” Speegle has trained with the Federal Emergency Management Association, and he and Küsse have completed numerous search and rescue classes. “I’ve taken advanced building search classes through detection services, and I’ve had boat training to locate bodies in the water,” Speegle said. He’s accustomed to receiving calls for help from Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson. On March 4, Speegle and Küsse were called to work search and reconnaissance efforts in Cookeville, Tennessee, after a powerful EF4 tornado decimated the town in the early morning. Cookeville is the county seat of Putnam County, 79 miles east of Nashville. “Küsse and I worked for hours on end to help find survivors and bring closure to families with missing loved ones,” said Speegle, who volunteers with the White Oak Volunteer Fire Department’s K-9 Search and Rescue crew. The team also uses highly trained cadaver dogs. “It was like a bomb went off there,” he said. “We stayed until the last person was accounted for – it wasn’t pretty, as you can imagine.” Despite their round-the-clock search March 4-6, Küsse and Speegle found no survivors among the 27 people missing. Speegle trained Küsse with the “recall/refind” method. “I say, ‘show me,’ and she will return to me and lead me to the person,” he said. “When she finds somebody, she gets her purple kong wubba, her favorite toy in the whole world.” “The new thinking is you don’t want the dog to bark at someone and scare them, so she’s trained to find them and, depending on the distance, she returns to me and makes me know she found them,” he said. Speegle uses a handheld detection module linked to Küsse’s GPS-monitored collar, which can track her up to 9 miles. “Occasionally, with small children, the dog won’t leave the child,” he said. “It will lay down and stay with the subject, so we can still track where the dog is. “She also does scent article finds,” Speegle said. “Küsse locates a person using a scent article – a sock, hat or shirt, for instance. “Küsse will work on- or off-lead,” he said. “If you have someone lost in a national forest, she can use that scent to find them.” Küsse recently helped in the search for a 20-year-old marathon runner from Colbert County near Muscle Shoals, Alabama, whose family reported him missing. “He’d gone running in the evening and it had stormed all night,” Speegle said. “We tracked him 200 to 300 yards but Küsse lost his scent because of the rain. But she assisted law enforcement to go in the right direction to find him.” Using video, the sheriff tracked the man’s run. The marathoner had been caught in the storm and sheltered overnight in the field house at Muscle Shoals High School. He borrowed a phone the next morning to call his parents. Honoring the past at LaGrange Cemetery Colbert County Commissioner Darol Bendall asked Speegle to locate unmarked historic graves at the historic LaGrange Cemetery in Leighton, Alabama. He and Küsse volunteered a weekend in April. “The descendants would like to know where they’re at – it’s rough terrain,” said Speegle, who assisted other members of the LaGrange Living History Association. “There are probably 100 graves that are unaccounted for, some of which date to 1815.” The project was an excellent training opportunity. Speegle, Küsse and his other dogs located nine lost gravesites. During the years, headstones for a man and his wife, dating to the 1800s, had been moved about 50 yards from their resting place. Volunteers reset the headstones properly. Other graves were found outside the cemetery. “My cadaver dog found an unmarked grave in a wooded area,” he said. During the work, a volunteer’s child went missing. “This little 6-year-old girl had wandered off 200 to 300 yards,” Speegle said. “Küsse found her at the back of the cemetery, at the wood line. It was a little scary for all of us.” Speegle finds a lot of satisfaction in helping others. “There was no happy ending in Tennessee, but finding the little girl was a good one,” he said. “Küsse is at the beginning of her career. I hope she serves her community well. If she wins in her overall category, I will be one proud daddy.” (Courtesy of Alabama NewsCenter)",0.0

When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.' "" On Wednesday, Francis says, he is joining the faithful in Minneapolis and across the U.S. ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican. Here's the full text of that portion of his remarks: ""I greet the English-speaking faithful joining us through the media. ""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that ""the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" ""Today I join the Church in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and in the entire United States, in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism. Let us pray for the consolation of their grieving families and friends and let us implore the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn. May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. ""May God bless all of you and your families. """,0.0

As protesters march side by side, they risked spreading and contracting the virus that can now infect thousands of households. COVID-19 testing sites may also not be accessible, limiting diagnoses of the deadly disease. Marchers, some not wearing masks, can be seen chanting, and in some cases screaming, during protests and demonstrations this week. “When people are yelling or speaking in a loud voice, you do have more projection of saliva. And with that, potentially (the) virus,” Chicago Public Health Department’s Dr. Allison Arwady said. Packed-in, moving crowds also do not allow protesters to stay a safe distance away from each other. “One of the reasons we always make that 6-foot recommendation and have the cloth face covering recommendation, is those are the two best ways to prevent transmission,” Arwady said. Now, before mass infections spread, health experts and officials in cities like Chicago are urging anyone who participated in the protest to self isolate. “Please, in exercising your First Amendment rights, or if you were out for any other reason, you have now put yourself at risk and we need you to isolate yourself,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We need you to think about, and be conscious of, whether you are experiencing any signs or symptoms.” “My worry is that we’ve already seen this so disproportionately impact black and brown communities in Chicago,” Arwady said. “What I want is for all of us, especially those communities, is to get on the other side of COVID here. And so if people can do these things that help keep themselves safe, help keep their close contacts safe, it’s in the best interest of them and then really the whole city.” Protesters are urged to stay far away from their family member in high coronavirus risk due to diabetes, heart disease, asthma, age or obesity. “I really want people to recognize that over these next 14 days … I don’t want you in close contact with people who have those underlying conditions or people who are over 60 because you have a higher potential than you did previously to spread it,” Arwady said. “Nothing has changed about COVID and the problem is the virus doesn’t care what else is going on. The virus is just looking for opportunities to spread.” Testing in Chicago was halted Monday – even for people with symptoms – as the Illinois Department of public health was concerned about staff and potential patient safety. However, the city of Chicago has plenty of testing sites through hospitals and clinics. If you have symptoms, the message is, “Get tested.” LATEST POSTS",0.0

Last month, the CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began collecting more information on cases of the spread of coronavirus in nursing homes. According to a press release from CMS this week, the data shows more than 60,000 COVID-19 cases have also been confirmed in these homes. As of May 24, only 80% of nursing homes nationwide had reported the required data to the CDC, out of the 15,400 homes funded by Medicare and Medicaid. Of the nursing homes that reported data, approximately one in four facilities had at least one COVID-19 case, and one in five facilities had at least one COVID-19 related death. “Early analysis shows that facilities with a one-star quality rating were more likely to have large numbers of COVID-19 cases than facilities with a five-star quality rating,” the release read. “CMS will take enforcement action against the nursing homes that have not reported data into the CDC as required under CMS participation requirements.” CMS reports they will post the CDC-collected data on a link later this week.
