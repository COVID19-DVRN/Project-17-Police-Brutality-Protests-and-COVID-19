Pro-democracy supporters have sharply criticized a proposal, set to be approved by China's rubber-stamp parliament this week, that would ban secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference, in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The pro-democracy camp says the proposal goes against the “one country, two systems” framework that promises Hong Kong freedoms not found in mainland China. Crowds of demonstrators dressed in black gathered in the Causeway Bay district on Sunday, chanting slogans such as “Stand with Hong Kong,” “Liberate Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our times.” The protest was a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and protesters. Police raised blue flags, warning protesters to disperse, before firing multiple rounds of tear gas. They later fired a water cannon at the demonstrators. At least 180 people were arrested, mostly on charges of unlawful assembly, police said. They also said that some of the protesters threw bricks and splashed unidentified liquid at officers, injuring at least four members of the police media liaison team. They warned that such behavior is against the law and that police would pursue the matter. Activist Tam Tak-chi was arrested for what police said was unauthorized assembly. The bill that triggered Sunday's rally was submitted at the opening of China's national legislative session Friday. It would bypass Hong Kong's legislature and could allow mainland agencies to be set up in the city, sparking concern that Chinese agents could arbitrarily arrest people for activities deemed to be pro-democracy. Speaking at an annual news conference during the legislative session, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Hong Kong affairs were an internal matter for China, and that “no external interference will be tolerated.”",0.0

Beshear hung from tree at end of a second amendment rally,https://www.wishtv.com/news/national/effigy-of-kentucky-gov-beshear-hung-from-tree-at-end-of-a-second-amendment-rally/,en,False,,25139,wishtv.com,http://www.wishtv.com,"Effigy of Kentucky Gov. Beshear hung from tree at end of Second Amendment rally (CNN) — A group of protesters holding a rally outside of Gov. Andy Beshear’s mansion at the state Capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky, on Sunday hung an effigy of the governor on a tree outside. The protest was advertised on Facebook as a Patriot Day Rally to exercise Second Amendment rights. As the rally was winding down, someone drove up in a pick up truck and pulled the effigy of Beshear out of a bag and hung it on a tree, Gerry Seavo James told CNN. The effigy had a note around its neck with the Latin phrase “sic semper tyrannis,” which roughly translates to “thus always to tyrants.” Generally attributed to Brutus, the phrase was shouted by the assassin John Wilkes Booth when he shot President Abraham Lincoln and is also the state motto of Virginia. James, a freelance journalist, has been attending and documenting Second Amendment rallies over the past month, he said. “It’s a very chilling image to see in modern America. And especially as an African American man,” James explained. After the effigy was hung from a tree another man came up and cut it down, James said. “There’s a gentleman that came up. He was pretty upset about it, and he cut it down. And he was like this has no place at this rally. We’re trying to be peaceful,” James said. Democrats and Republicans condemned the actions toward the Democratic governor. “The act that was displayed on Capitol grounds today, near where the Governor and his young children live, was wrong and offensive. This type of behavior must be condemned,” Crystal Staley, communications director for Beshear, said in an email to CNN Sunday night. “As Kentuckians we should be able to voice our opinions without turning to hate and threats of violence. Put simply — we are and should be better than this.” Sen. Mitch McConnell and the state Republican Party also reacted to the news on Twitter Sunday night, denouncing the actions of those involved. In a tweet, McConnell said, “As a strong defender of the First Amendment, I believe Americans have the right to peacefully protest. However, today’s action toward Governor Beshear is unacceptable. There is no place for hate in Kentucky.” The Republican Party of Kentucky tweeted about the incident. “What occurred at today’s rally was unacceptable and has no place in Kentucky’s political discourse. The Republican Party of Kentucky strongly condemns the violent imagery against the Governor in today’s protest.”",0.0

Lam tried again Tuesday to defend a new national security law that China's parliament is going to impose on Hong Kong. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s leader said Tuesday that national security legislation proposed by China’s legislature will not threaten the semi-autonomous territory’s civil rights, despite widespread criticism of the move as an encroachment on freedom of speech and assembly. The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was “no need for us to worry” over the move being considered by China’s ceremonial National People’s Congress. “Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,” Lam said. “Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.” Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong’s international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government’s determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year’s street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. The U.S. has sharply criticized the proposed legislation and threatened to withdraw preferential trade status for Hong Kong. Some “foreign politicians” have “expressed untrue opinions” about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target “a minority,” citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong’s streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong’s government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law — its mini-constitution — to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem — as often seen at soccer games — along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi’s tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China’s intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi’s difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0

Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying ""This is the right call.”  The man's death Monday night was under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement authorities. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.  In a post on his Facebook page, Frey apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer's treatment of the man, who was later identified as 46-year-old George Floyd, who worked security at a restaurant.  “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted.  Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.  The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.  Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” The man calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He's talking, so he's breathing.”  But Floyd stops talking and slowly becomes motionless under the officer's restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.  Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.  At one point, an officer says: “Don't do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don't do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”  The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending.  Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.  He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”  Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family.  “We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck,” Crump said in a statement. “This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge.”  Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation. Police did not identify the officers, but attorney Tom Kelly confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. Kelly declined to comment further.  Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. News accounts show he was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault.  Several hundred protesters gathered early Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can't breathe"" and “Jail killer KKKops.""  Experts on police use of force told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd's death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”  “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,"" Scott said. ""I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”  The New York City officer in the Garner case said he was using a legal maneuver called “the seatbelt” to bring down Garner, whom police said had been resisting arrest. But the medical examiner referred to it as a chokehold in the autopsy report and said it contributed to his death. Chokehold maneuvers are banned under New York police policy.  A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved in Garner’s death, sparking protests around the country. The New York Police Department ultimately fired the officer who restrained Garner, but it was five years later, after a federal investigation, a city prosecutor’s investigation and an internal misconduct trial.  In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect's neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.  A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable.  Before the officers were fired, the police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers."" Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.  The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would handle any prosecution of police on state criminal charges, said in a statement that it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. The FBI is investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his rights. If those federal civil rights charges are brought, they would be handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota, which declined comment.  The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery's father.  ------  Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.    ",0.0

His wife, Eleana Tee Cobb, announced on Facebook that her husband died at his New York City home from lung cancer. He was 91. Born in Washington, D.C., Cobb told The Associated Press in 2019 he listened to jazz albums and stayed up late to hear disc jockey Symphony Sid playing jazz in New York City before launching his professional career. He said it was saxaphonist Cannonball Adderley who recommended him to Davis, and he ended up playing on several Davis recordings. But Cobb’s role as a drummer on the “Kind of Blue” jam session headed by Davis would forever change his career. That album also featured Adderley and John Coltrane. The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He'd also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye. ------ This story corrects a previous version that misspelled the name of Miles Davis. ------ Associated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this piece from Portland, Maine. ------ Contreras reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

He said, “Don’t kill me!” A short time later, the Minneapolis Police Department announced the man, believed to be in his 40’s, died of a “medical incident.” During a press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey became emotional before he spoke. “For five minutes we watched as a white officer pressed his knee to the neck of a black man. For five minutes,” Frey said. “When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense.

By Ray Sanchez, Joe Sutton and Artemis Moshtaghian, CNN (CNN) -- Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired for their involvement in the death of a black man who was held down with a knee as he protested that he couldn't breathe, officials said Tuesday. The FBI is investigating the incident, which drew widespread condemnation of the officers after a video showing part of the encounter circulated on social media. The death of George Floyd, 46, drew hundreds of people to the streets of Minneapolis on Tuesday. Protesters -- many wearing face masks -- held ""I can't breathe"" signs and chanted together near the site of Monday's incident. Some motorists honked in support. Later in the evening, police attempted to disperse the crowds outside the Minneapolis Police 3rd Precinct after a front glass window was smashed, John Elder, director of the office of public information for the police department, told CNN. The four officers were ""separated from employment,"" Officer Garrett Parten, a police spokesman, said Tuesday. ""I support your decisions, one hundred percent,"" said Mayor Jacob Frey, in a statement about police Chief Medaria Arradondo's firing of the officers. ""It is the right decision for our city. The right decision for our community, it is the right decision for the Minneapolis Police Department."" Officers responding to an alleged forgery in progress Monday evening were initially told that a person later described as the suspect was sitting on a car and appeared to be under the influence, police said. A pair of officers located the man, who was at that point inside the car and who police said ""physically resisted"" the officers when ordered to get out. Officers handcuffed the man, who ""appeared to be suffering medical distress,"" according to police. He died at a hospital a short time later, police said. Mayor Jacob Frey has said the technique used to pin George Floyd's head to the ground was against department regulations. After several minutes of pleading with an officer pressing a knee to the back of his neck, the man appeared motionless, his eyes shut, his head against the pavement. Frey, speaking during a town hall streamed on Facebook, said the officer had no reason to employ the hold on the man's neck. ""The technique that was used is not permitted; is not a technique that our officers get trained in on,"" he said. ""And our chief has been very clear on that piece. There is no reason to apply that kind of pressure with a knee to someone's neck."" The video shows two officers by the man on the ground -- one of them with his knee over the back of the man's neck. The video did not capture what led up to the arrest or what police described as the man resisting arrest. ""Please, I can't breathe,"" the man said, screaming for several minutes before he became silent. Bystanders urged the officer to release the man from his hold. Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, in a statement, identified the man as Floyd and said he was representing his family. The mayor also identified him on Twitter. ""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck,"" Crump said. ""This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge."" Floyd's cause and manner of death remains pending and is being investigated by local, state and federal law enforcement, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar via Twitter called the incident ""yet another horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an African American man dying."" Frey on Tuesday offered his condolences to the man's family, adding that ""what we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up."" ""For five minutes, we watched as a white officer pressed his knee to the neck of a black man,"" Frey told reporters. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic human sense. What happened on Chicago and 38th this last night is simply awful. It was traumatic and it serves as a clear reminder of just how far we have to go."" ""Being black in America,"" Frey said, should not be ""a death sentence."" The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the officers were cooperating in the investigation. ""Now is not the time rush to (judgment) and immediately condemn our officers,"" the statement said. ""Officers' actions and training protocol will be carefully examined after the officers have provided their statements."" In a Facebook video posted Monday, bystanders urged the officer to get off the man. Two officers handled the man on the ground while another stood nearby with his eyes on the bystanders as traffic passed in the background. ""My stomach hurts,"" the man told the officer. ""My neck hurts. Everything hurts."" At one point the man said, ""Give me some water or something. Please. Please."" ""His nose is bleeding,"" a woman said of the man. ""He's not even resisting arrest,"" one man said. ""He's not responding right now, bro."" Frey said he understood the anger in the community but reminded potential protesters that ""there is another danger out there right now which is Covid-19."" ""We need to make sure that everyone that is protesting and that is voicing their opinion stays safe and their families are protected as well,"" he said. ""So please, practice safe distancing, please use a mask."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Tuesday, ""The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. We will get answers and seek justice."" St. Paul, Minnesota, Mayor Melvin Carter called the video of the incident ""one of the most vile and heartbreaking images I've ever seen."" ""The officer who stood guard is just as responsible as his partner; both must be held fully accountable,"" Carter tweeted. ""This must stop now."" Paige Fernandez, policing policy adviser for the ACLU, said the incident recalled the 2014 New York death of Eric Garner, who repeated ""I can't breathe"" several times after a police officer held him in a chokehold. Garner died during the arrest, the incident also caught on video. ""Even in places like Minneapolis, where chokeholds are technically banned, Black people are targeted by the police for low-level offenses and are subjected to unreasonable, unnecessary violence,"" Fernandez said in a statement. ""Make no mistake: George Floyd should be alive today. The officers responsible must be held accountable."" Body worn cameras were activated during the incident, police said.

Gov. Andy Beshear referred to the protesters as a mob in sharply condemning the weekend rally that spread to the Governor's Mansion, where his children play. And the Democratic governor bluntly accused some Kentucky politicians of culpability for attending a previous rally. “Let’s start by calling it what it was and what it is — actions aimed at creating fear and terror,"" Beshear said of Sunday's rally. “Crossing over barriers, standing on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids and hanging me in an effigy, that’s an action intended to use fear to get their way."" Beshear said he would not be deterred by the demonstration. He has stressed the need to reopen the state safely, phasing in business restarts amid the health crisis. Non-essential retail stores and restaurant dining rooms have been among the reopenings, though with restrictions meant to adhere to social distancing. Beshear also has strongly urged the wearing of masks. “I will not be afraid,"" he said at his daily coronavirus briefing. “I will not be bullied. And I will not back down, not to them and not to anybody else.” The effigy was hung in a tree near the State Capitol during what was billed as a protest rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. The rally turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear’s administration, according to media reports, with protesters chanting outside the Governor's Mansion for him to come outside. Beshear said Tuesday that the protesters have been “embraced and emboldened” by some elected leaders. A handful of Republican lawmakers had attended a previous rally. Some prominent GOP leaders condemned the actions at Sunday's rally. Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the protesters' actions as “completely outrageous and unacceptable.” Without naming anyone, the governor urged elected officials to no longer “cater"" to such groups, saying: “You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire."" “You can’t wait until something nasty and horrible happens to then claim it’s wrong while you’ve catered the support of certain groups for votes or other reasons,” he added. Beshear said he doesn’t regret moving his wife and their two children to the Governor’s Mansion, located across the street from the statehouse grounds, but said security measures will be reviewed. He wondered aloud how the protesters would react “if someone else who is armed walked up on their patio?"""" “They walked up and stood on the front porch, and there, just a window pane away from where my kids play, the mob chanted and heckled,"" Beshear said. “Thankfully, my kids weren’t there that day. But I want to remind you they are 9 and 10 years old.” Kentucky State Police had little to say Tuesday about the protest. “The Kentucky State Police does not comment on the level of security provided to protect the governor, nor any inquiries that we receive regarding these efforts,” said Sgt. Josh Lawson, commander of the agency's public affairs branch, speaking with the Lexington Herald-Leader. Beshear, the son of a former Kentucky governor, is known for his disciplined, even-keeled style. But he let his emotions show when pressed by reporters about the incident. “I’m not going to let a bunch of jerks change the way that we’re living our life,"" he said. Beshear made another statement about the protest during his briefing. Each day, he takes time to learn a few more words of sign language from a sign language interpreter. On Tuesday, the lesson he signed was: Love, not hate.",0.0

Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades on some protesters, reports said. The protest started peacefully but the situation deteriorated and some demonstrators were seen breaking windows of police cars and hurling rocks, reports said. Floyd, 46, died Monday night and video later emerged showing the man on the ground with a police officer pressing his knee against his neck. Footage released of the incident showed Floyd shouting, “I cannot breathe” and “Don’t kill me.” GEORGE FLOYD’S COUSINS SPEAK OUT ABOUT HEARTBREAK OVER HIS DEATH IN MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CUSTODY Officers had responded to a call from a grocery store that claimed Floyd had allegedly used a forged check. Floyd’s death sparked new tensions between police and the black community. “We’re here to let them know this can’t be tolerated, there will be severe consequences if they continue to kill us this will not go on another day,” a protester said, according to Minneapolis’s WCCO-TV. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, released a statement on Tuesday and called it another “horrifying and gutwrenching instance of an African American man dying.” The protests began on the south side of Minneapolis, near where Floyd was arrested. Protesters were seen sitting in the crosswalks and using their own vehicles to block traffic. Organizers emphasized keeping this protest peaceful, but chaos began to swell during the day, according to Fox 9 Minneapolis. Some carried signs reading “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops,” according to the Guardian. Protesters continued to block traffic during the evening. As the crowds grew, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota reminded protesters to keep their distance to help stop the spread of COVID-19, WCCO reported. The sounds of motorcycles revving were also captured on video as they sent crowds running during the protest, with many demonstrators confused as to what was happening, according to the station. The protesters later moved toward the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct where crowds swelled. People were seen throwing rocks at the building, as well as at police cruisers — with one being sprayed with paint, according to FOX 9. Protesters threw water and milk bottles at the officers, shouting “pigs” and “how could you,” the Guardian reported. Police fired green teargas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd approaching the station. “It’s real ugly. The police have to understand that this is the climate they have created, this is the climate they created,” another protester said, according to WCCO. 4 MINNEAPOLIS OFFICERS FIRED IN DEATH OF BLACK MAN AFTER VIDEO SHOWS OFFICER PINNING KNEE AGAINST HIS NECK As rains came down in the city, demonstrators were seen using carts at a Target store as cover before police launched tear gas. The four officers were terminated Tuesday. Klobuchar called a step in the right direction on Tuesday. “Those responsible must still be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” she added. “Justice must be served.” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, later called the actions by police “a disgusting display.” “I’m here on the southside, helping people as I can with milk, water, and towels,” she said. “So far, I have been unable to prevent the police from firing indiscriminately into the crowd. Moments ago, I held a towel to a teenage girls head as blood poured from it” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Tuesday that the officers involved had been fired after they were initially placed on paid leave. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) are investigating Floyd’s death. Ben Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, told TMX.news the officer shown in the video with his knee on Floyd’s neck should be charged with murder and that the other officers should be charged as accomplices.

1618074945,2020-05-27 10:10:01,Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200527/swift-firings-for-minneapolis-officers-in-death-of-black-man,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd's death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor's full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles, with tense skirmishes stretching late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show in an interview Wednesday morning that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she hadn't watched the bystander's video, but told ABC's “Good Morning America” that “I don’t understand how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that."" Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: ""This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday's protests, somechanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” And some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery's father. ------ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.",0.0

I don’t need them to be suspended and able to work in another state or county. Their license should be taken away, their job should be taken away, and they should be put in jail for murder.” In the video recorded by a bystander, Floyd, 46, is seen on the ground, with one white officer holding a knee to his neck, gasping and repeatedly telling the officer, “I can’t breathe.” He later died in custody. Police were responding to an alleged forgery taking place. A man matching Floyd’s description allegedly used a counterfeit bill. PROTESTERS CLASH WITH MINNEAPOLIS POLICE AFTER GEORGE FLOYD’S DEATH Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the family, said the video showed “a non-violent crime was met with this kind of violent, lethal, excessive force,” as the officer was on Floyd’s neck for “nine minutes while he was begging to breathe, begging for life.” “It’s an ‘I Can’t Breathe’ again case in 2020, and it’s worse than Eric Gardner in many ways because you hear the people even pleading with them. Please, get your knee off his neck, have some humanity. This is a human being,” Crump said. The FBI has been called in to aid local police in the investigation into Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, heard in another video saying, “I can’t breathe.” That video and phrase soon galvanized the “Black Lives Matter” movement. In the Garner case, family and activists pleaded for five years before the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was removed from the force in 2019, though he never faced federal charges. LEBRON JAMES, OTHER STAR ATHLETES SPEAK OUT ON GEORGE FLOYD’S DEATH Following the Minneapolis officers’ dismissal Tuesday, law enforcement faced added scrutiny, as police in the streets of Minneapolis deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to calm protesters. Thousands filled an intersection in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Crowds began to swell outside the department’s 3rd Precinct, with some protesters damaging windows and a squad car. “Shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at unarmed protesters when there are children present should never be tolerated. Ever,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, tweeted. “What is happening tonight in our city is shameful. Police need to exercise restraint, and our community needs space to heal.” Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, also reacted to the case on Twitter, writing: “George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.” “I’m grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation.” Activists, including Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., shared a side-by-side photo of the Minneapolis officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality and other social issues. “If you’re unbothered or mildly bothered by the 1st knee, but outraged by the 2nd, then, in my father’s words, you’re “more devoted to order than to justice.” And more passionate about an anthem that supposedly symbolizes freedom than you are about a Black man’s freedom to live,” King wrote. She added: “And you’re more caring concerning a flag than you are concerning a fellow human being. That’s inhumane, tragic and unjust. That’s dangerous for Black people and deadly for #GeorgeFloyd.” Minnesota’s Democratic leaders, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Betty McCollum, sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to urge a “thorough investigations at all levels. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, retweeted a message from Republican Sen. Tim Scott, who is black, which called for the four Minneapolis officers to be arrested. “Firing the officers that killed #GeorgeFloyd was the right first move. The second? Arrest them. #icantbreathe,” Scott, from South Carolina, tweeted. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The medical examiner’s office has not released Floyd’s official cause of death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The FBI has been called into investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.

1618156777,2020-05-27 11:00:01,Protesters mass in Hong Kong as anthem law is debated,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/world/20200527/protesters-mass-in-hong-kong-as-anthem-law-is-debated,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"HONG KONG – Thousands of protesters shouted pro-democracy slogans and insults at police in Hong Kong on Wednesday as lawmakers debated a bill criminalizing abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming. Nearly 300 people were arrested across Hong Kong for unauthorized assembly, according to Facebook posts by the Hong Kong police force. Separately, at least 17 people, mostly teenagers, were arrested for possessing items that could be used for unlawful purposes, such as gasoline bombs or screwdrivers, or for driving slowly and blocking traffic, police said. The bill would make it illegal to insult or abuse the Chinese national anthem, “March of the Volunteers” in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. “Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. “The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. “We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don’t respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country's dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,"" Mok said. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government’s decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China's ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong's own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.”",0.0

Sign up here. Latin America has become the new epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak, as the region has seen more than 2.4 million cases and more than 143,000 deaths, a health official announced Tuesday. Carissa F. Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), said in a press briefing in Washington, D.C., that her researchers “are particularly concerned that the number of new cases reported last week in Brazil was the highest for a seven-day period, since the outbreak began.” “Both Peru and Chile are also reporting a high incidence,” she added. “Now is not the time to relax restrictions or scale back preventive strategies. Now is the time to stay strong, remain vigilant, and aggressively implement proven public health measures.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE A new U.S. travel ban on Brazil will go into effect late Thursday, as Latin America continues to see a dramatic surge in cases coupled with a nasty rise in corruption. The Trump administration “has determined that the Federative Republic of Brazil is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission” of the virus, according to a White House statement released Sunday. The U.S. Defense Department said Brazil will be added to a list of travel-restricted countries currently including Iran, China, and most European countries, which have all been highly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. American citizens, legal permanent residents, and their immediate families who are returning to the U.S. after recently visiting Brazil or other travel-restricted countries may still reenter by going through a process for enhanced medical screenings at designated airports. “As we reopen the U.S. economy, the Trump administration is continuing to take aggressive measures to protect the American people from COVID-19,” said Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf. “By adding Brazil to the list of travel-restricted nations based on a careful and thorough analysis of data, we are proactively mitigating another risk factor to our communities. While this may be disruptive to some travelers, action is needed to protect the public from further spread of the virus.” BRAZIL'S BOLSONARO FLOUTS SOCIAL DISTANCING, POSES FOR PICS WITH KIDS AS SAO PAULO HEALTH SYSTEM REACHES NEAR COLLAPSE To accommodate the inclusion of Brazil, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport were added to the list of now 15 U.S. airports currently receiving flights from travel-restricted nations. At her press conference Tuesday, Etienne also stressed the need for “aggressive preventive measures to protect people with diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases from the new coronavirus,” suggesting implementing telemedicine could decrease the risk of contagion in waiting rooms. As healthcare workers in Latin America being prioritized to treat the influx of COVID-19 patients, those who suffer from non-communicable diseases lack access to care due to disruptions in the health system. The PAHO said, before the pandemic, 81 percent of all deaths Latin America were due to non-communicable diseases, with 39 percent of these deaths were premature before age 70. MEXICAN NURSES ON CORONAVIRUS FRONTLINES TARGETTED IN 'VIRTUAL KIDNAPPING,' EXTORTION PLOT: OFFICIALS Corruption in Latin America is on the rise amid the pandemic, as politicians from Panama to Argentina have been forced to resign in recent weeks for allegedly profiteering off the crisis, making fraudulent purchases of ventilators, masks, and other medical supplies, the New York Times reported. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has faced widespread scrutiny both domestically and from abroad for flouting the advice of his own public health advisers, mingling and taking photos among large crowds of supporters during the pandemic. Dismissing the coronavirus as a “little flu,” Bolsonaro has also condemned state governors for imposing stay-at-home measures and other social distancing measures and instead has encouraged Brazilians to get back to work. Meanwhile, hospitals have become overwhelmed across Brazil, the largest country in South America, and in the city of São Paulo, officials say the public healthcare system is reaching near collapse. On Tuesday, police raided the home of Rio de Janeiro’s governor as part of a federal coronavirus corruption probe. Gov. Wilson Witzel, once an ally-turned-foe of Bolsonaro, is accused of using his wife's law firm to embezzle money from government contractors hired to build field hospitals amid the pandemic, according to Reuters.

(Evan Frost/Minnesota Public Radio via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday’s death of George Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” But despite the officers’ swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles. Tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC’s “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother’s death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that she does not understand “how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday’s protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway.

Nearby, the scene resembled a riot, with looters striking at a Target store off East Lake Street, which is near the precinct building, according to Fox 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul. “This is awful out here,” tweeted Karen Scullin, one of the channel’s weekend anchors. “No police. Looting continues.” She posted video that showed a mob of people, many of them in masks, at the front of the store. Looters made off with items ranging from TVs to clothing and even groceries, the outlet reported. 4 MINNEAPOLIS OFFICERS FIRED IN DEATH OF BLACK MAN AFTER VIDEO SHOWS OFFICER PINNING KNEE AGAINST HIS NECK In the video that prompted the protests, Floyd pleaded for his life and said he couldn’t breathe. Numerous bystanders implored the police to take the pressure off of his neck and check his pulse. He was unconscious by the end of the clip, which is several minutes long. Medics arrived in an ambulance to load him onto a stretcher, and he appeared limp. He was later pronounced dead. Lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum have voiced concerns over the video, with President Trump tweeting Wednesday night that he had requested the FBI to open an investigation in Floyd’s death. “My heart goes out to George’s family and friends,” Trump wrote. “Justice will be served.” In the suburban community of Oakdale, photos show that protesters rallied near the home of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin – one of four cops the department fired this week after Floyd’s death. Other protesters rallied outside the county prosecutor’s home. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The department has identified the fired officers as Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. Chaos also broke out in the city on Tuesday night, prompting police to respond with rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades, according to local reports. Despite the protests, Minneapolis Mayer Jacob Frey is among the people who have called for charges to be brought in the case. “If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they’d already be behind bars,” he tweeted Wednesday. “That’s why today I’m calling on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the arresting officer in this case.” Fox News’ David Aaro and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

1618614380,2020-05-27 11:00:16,Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/swift-firings-minneapolis-officers-death-black-man,en,True,,175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"By AMY FORLITI and JEFF BAENEN Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd's death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor's full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander's video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man's neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Floyd's death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building's windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles, with tense skirmishes stretching late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC's ""Today"" show in an interview Wednesday morning that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because ""that's exactly what they did."" She said she hadn't watched the bystander's video, but told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that ""I don't understand how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that."" Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: ""This is the right call."" The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD's internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner's family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven't even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to ""rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers."" Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, ""I can't breathe"" and ""Jail killer KKKops."" And some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin's service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect's neck is allowed under the department's use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a ""non-deadly force option,"" according to the department's policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department's use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd's death ""a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training."" ""He couldn't move. He was telling them he couldn't breathe, and they ignored him,"" Scott said. ""I can't even describe it. It was difficult to watch."" In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer's treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. ""Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man's neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,"" Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. ""Please, please, please, I can't breathe. Please, man,"" said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they're doing work, the officers in the video aren't wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to ""relax."" Floyd calls for his mother and says: ""My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can't breathe."" As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, ""He's talking, so he's breathing."" But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer's restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. ""He's not responsive right now!"" Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man's pulse. ""Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!"" she said. At one point, an officer says: ""Don't do drugs, guys."" And one man yells, ""Don't do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?"" The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was ""a good friend, person and a good tenant,"" the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. ""He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him."" Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd's family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery's father.",0.0
1618614311,2020-05-27 12:00:25,Protesters mass in Hong Kong as anthem law is debated,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/protesters-mass-hong-kong-anthem-law-debated,en,True,,175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"By ZEN SOO Associated Press HONG KONG (AP) — Thousands of protesters shouted pro-democracy slogans and insults at police in Hong Kong on Wednesday as lawmakers debated a bill criminalizing abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming. Nearly 300 people were arrested across Hong Kong for unauthorized assembly, according to Facebook posts by the Hong Kong police force. Separately, at least 17 people, mostly teenagers, were arrested for possessing items that could be used for unlawful purposes, such as gasoline bombs or screwdrivers, or for driving slowly and blocking traffic, police said. The bill would make it illegal to insult or abuse the Chinese national anthem, ""March of the Volunteers"" in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. ""Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,"" pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. ""The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,"" he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. ""We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don't respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country's dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,"" Mok said. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government's decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China's ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong's own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called ""erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.""

1618620628,2020-05-28 01:00:00,Unrest follows man's death,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200528/unrest-follows-mans-death,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. “I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired – an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. A smaller protest was underway Wednesday afternoon outside the same precinct, with roughly a dozen officers behind barriers and a couple hundred protesters occasionally yelling at them and throwing objects. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota's two top black law enforcement officials – Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington – promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison stopped short of endorsing the mayor's call for charging the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it's important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which would prosecute any state charges against the officer, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.",0.0

Protests erupted Tuesday after video emerged of a police officer with his knee pressed against George Floyd’s neck while the man was in custody. Protesters have called for the officers involved to be charged in his death. Max Nesterak, a reporter at the Minnesota Reformer, interviewed a group of armed men outside a tobacconist who said they agree with the protests but not the looting. They said police in the city have been overextended and they stopped at the tobacco shop because they were told that the business owners were desperate to protect their store. ‘STAR WARS’ ACTOR JOHN BOYEGA SLAMS ‘RACIST WHITE PEOPLE’ IN REACTION TO FLOYD DEATH “These guys are out here with machetes, with shattered windows trying to keep looters out because cops can’t get in here,” one of the armed men said. “So I figured before there were cops, there were Americans. So here we are.” Another armed man said, “We definitely don’t agree with the looting, but we do agree with the cause and the protest.” Some commenters on social media worried that armed citizens could escalate the situation. Looting has been recorded at a Target store off East Lake Street and an AutoZone was set on fire near a police precinct. Officers could be seen surrounding the precinct but did not attempt to intervene in the looting. Earlier, some protesters skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. Fox 9 Minneapolis reported that fire crews worked to put out the fire at AutoZone, which is close to the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct. Gov. Tim Walz took to Twitter late Wednesday to tell people in the area to leave and called the unfolding situation “extremely dangerous.” “For everyone’s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene,” he posted. Other stores that were involved in looting included a Cub Foods and a Dollar Tree. Fox News’ Mike Tobin, reporting live from a protest, said he was caught in the crossfire and said he felt pepper spray get into his eyes. “Some of the flashbangs have been deployed, primarily from the police on the rooftop,” Tobin said at one point, standing with a news camera and microphone between the lines of protesters and police officers. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody and a citizen’s cell phone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Floyd was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police had responded to an alleged forgery taking place. A man matching Floyd’s description allegedly used a counterfeit bill. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Federal investigators have joined the investigation into Floyd’s death. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI has been called in to aid local police in the investigation into Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, heard in another video saying, “I can’t breathe.” Fox News’ Danielle Wallace and the Associated Press contributed to this report",0.0

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” A man poses for photos in front of a fire at an AutoZone store, while protesters hold a rally for George Floyd in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” A man poses for photos in front of a fire at an AutoZone store, while protesters hold a rally for George Floyd in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

The yet to be drafted law will ultimately be enacted in Hong Kong by decree, bypassing the local lawmaking process, where the Asian financial center is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy from Beijing under the “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement put in place when the former British colony was handed back to China. For the past year, Hong Kong has been rocked with protests that became increasingly violent and anti-Beijing toward the end of 2019. While the COVID-19 pandemic has kept the unrest largely off the streets until recently, Beijing has signaled that it has lost all patience for dissent in the city. In introducing the proposal to a vote, the preamble reads, “In recent years, the national security risks of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have become prominent, and various illegal activities such as ‘Hong Kong independence,’ splitting the country, and violent terrorist activities have seriously endangered the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the country.” The proposal for the law was approved in China’s rubber-stamp parliament 2,878 votes to one, just hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong was “no longer autonomous from China” setting in place the possibility of ending the special treatment the trading hub had enjoyed under U.S. law. Over 1,300 American companies have offices in Hong Kong and the city is home to roughly 85,000 American citizens. Despite having been largely spared the direct impacts of the U.S.-China trade war, the city has been increasingly caught in between Beijing and Washington as their relationship continues to crater in the wake of the pandemic. There is no actual law yet and the language of the proposal remains broad, but Hong Kong residents and even the Hong Kong government will have little say in the process. The city only has a sole delegate, Tam Yiu-chung, in China’s top lawmaker body, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which is expected to convene in June to hash out the specific language of the law and approve it. On the sidelines of the meetings this past week, Tam has tried to reassure Hong Kong residents, telling them they can express their views to the NPC via an online platform. It is unclear whether those views will be fully taken into account as Beijing has signaled it wants to fast track the law. Observers believe the law will likely be in place sometime over the summer ahead of the Hong Kong legislative elections in September, where the pro-democracy camp is hoping for a big win. Since the announcement, Beijing and its proxies have been trying to reassure Hong Kong residents that the law will only affect a small targeted portion of Hong Kong. Yet over the past week alone, the language of the proposal was expanded in scope to include groups and organizations in addition to individuals who engaged in acts and activities of sedition, secession and foreign interference. Issues that will need to be clarified are whether those charged with the new law will be tried in Hong Kong or the mainland and whether local judges with foreign passports would be able to preside over cases. There is another hotly debated provision in the proposal that allows mainland Chinese security agents to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time. Hong Kong maintains a separate legal system to the mainland, so will these security agents adhere to locals laws? Hong Kong legal scholar Johannes Chan told Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) Thursday that it would be naive to believe that proposed law would only affect “a small group of people.” “In China they never really define what exactly is ‘national security,’” Chan said in the interview. “So the law could change according to political expediency or political necessity.” The proposed law has brought street protests back onto the streets of Hong Kong in recent days but they have been met with heavy police presence.

By Christina Maxouris, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy, CNN (CNN) -- Prosecutors looking at the death of George Floyd on Thursday asked the people of Minneapolis for patience while they investigate the case that has riled the city and the nation. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after pleading for help as a police officer used his knee on Floyd's neck to pin him -- unarmed and handcuffed -- to the ground. His death sparked outrage and protests across the country, demonstrations that continued Thursday. In Minneapolis, hundreds of people gathered outside the police departments Third Precinct. Some protesters brought signs and some threw rocks. A temporary fence in front of the station was knocked over. Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and bean bags fired at rock throwers. Earlier, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, giving an update to reporters on the case, said he must look at all evidence before bringing charges. ""My job in the end is to prove he violated a criminal statute. And there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge. We need to wade through all of that evidence and come to a meaningful decision and we are doing that to the best of our ability."" About 90 minutes later, Freeman's office released a statement, and told CNN that Freeman misspoke about ""other evidence."" ""Evidence not favorable to our case needs to be carefully examined to understand the full picture of what actually happened,"" the statement reads. ""This happens in every case. "" During the news conference, federal prosecutor Erica MacDonald told reporters she has hoped to brief them on a new development in the case but couldn't at this point. ""We are going to investigate it as expeditiously, as thoroughly as justice demands,"" Freeman told reporters. ""That video is graphic, horrific and terrible. And no person should do that."" Both MacDonald and Freeman said the investigation requires more time. ""I am pleading with individuals to remain calm and let us conduct this investigation,"" she said. ""Our highest priority is that justice will be served."" ""Sometimes that takes a little time and we ask people to be patient,"" Freeman said. ""We have to get this right."" The Minneapolis Police Department this week fired the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest. The incident is being investigated by local, state and federal authorities. All four officers involved in the death have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, Freeman told CNN following the press conference. Minnesota governor activates National Guard Minneapolis' police chief on Thursday acknowledged his department had contributed to a ""deficit of hope"" in the city after the -- and he and other officials called for calm following a night of destructive protests. ""I am absolutely sorry for the pain, devastation and trauma Mr. Floyd's death has left on his family, his loved ones,"" Minneapolis and the world, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a news conference. ""I know there is currently a deficit of hope in our city ... and I know our department has contributed to that deficit as a whole,"" Arradondo said. In Minneapolis, protests transitioned to rioting and looting south of downtown, with people smashing their way into stores and setting businesses and other buildings ablaze. There was more looting Thursday in St. Paul, the state capital, next door. Gov. Tim Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard to watch over the demonstrations. Other states saw protests too. There were gatherings in Denver and New York. At the latter protest, about 40 people were arrested and several officers were injured, a law enforcement official told CNN. The charges range from obstruction of governmental administration to criminal possession of a weapon, the official added. On Wednesday night, Minneapolis' second day of protests transitioned to rioting and looting south of downtown, with people smashing their way into stores and setting businesses and other buildings ablaze. One of Floyd's brothers cried Thursday morning as he said his family wants protests to be peaceful, but stressed people are struggling with seeing another black man die following a police encounter, this one over the passing of an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill at a store. ""I want everybody to be peaceful right now, but people are torn and hurt, because they're tired of seeing black men die,"" George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""These officers (involved in George's arrest) need to be arrested right now ... and held accountable about everything because these people want justice right now,"" he said. A man was fatally shot overnight near the protests, police said early Thursday. One person was arrested, and police said they're investigating the nature of the incident. Fires eventually broke out at businesses in the area, including an AutoZone. Flames lit up a building under construction, one floor eventually collapsing. At a nearby Target, video shows people taking cartloads of goods and loading them into their cars. People also raided a grocery store. On Thursday morning its exterior glass lay shattered and the floor was littered with groceries as a interior fire sprinkler system sprayed water. An unspecified number of police officers and other people suffered minor injuries in the protests, Arradondo said, without elaborating. The unrest followed shock and anger that spread through communities across the country as bystander video of Floyd's last moments alive began circulating on social media. The 46-year-old man was arrested Monday evening after, police said, officers were called to investigate alleged forgery at a corner store called Cup Foods. Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, an owner of the store, told CNN a staff member called police to report someone using a fake $20 bill. Police arrived, and Floyd, a suspect in the incident, was handcuffed and pinned on the ground. As he pleaded that he couldn't breathe, a police officer held him down with a knee on his neck. Three other officers also were at the scene. Floyd's family wants charges against four officers Floyd, a 46-year-old Houston native, worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He moved to Minneapolis for work and to drive trucks, his friend of more than 20 years, former NBA player Stephen Jackson, said. Jackson said Floyd, a father of two girls, was like a brother to him, and they used to refer to each other as twins. ""He was just a great dude ... somebody that wanted to be a protector and provider for everybody around him,"" Jackson told CNN Thursday. ""It sucks that the whole world had to see my friend go that way. ... He didn't deserve that, but the way that people are supportive of him and standing up for him ... his death will not be in vain."" No charges have been filed in Floyd's death, but his family say they want murder charges for all four fired officers. Who the officers are In a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also called for criminal charges to be brought against the officer who kept his knee on Floyd. That officer was identified by his attorney Tom Kelly as Derek Chauvin. Kelly has not released a statement on Chauvin's behalf. Chauvin had 18 complaints filed with the police department's internal affairs division, according to MPD. It's unclear what the complaints, which were all closed, were for and no details were provided by police. Only two of the 18 complaints against Chauvin were ""closed with discipline,"" according to a public summary from police. The ""discipline issued"" column listed a letter of reprimand for each of the two complaints. In an interview aired Thursday, Frey told CBS News that he believed Floyd's death constituted murder. ""I am not a prosecutor, but let me be clear: The arresting officer killed someone,"" Frew told CBS. ""He (Floyd) would be alive today if he were white."" The other three officers were identified by police as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Thomas Plunkett, representing Kueng, said, ""At this time, out of respect for Mr. Floyd, we are declining all invitations to discuss these painful events."" Earl Gray is representing another of the officers involved but has declined to say who his client is. Officers told witness Floyd resisted arrest Police said they arrested Floyd Monday after responding to the forgery call and finding him inside a car. Police said he ""physically resisted"" after he got out of the vehicle. Surveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant shows some of the officers' initial contact with him and doesn't appear to show obvious resistance from a handcuffed Floyd. Eventually Floyd is escorted away from view. Floyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital a short time later. A medics team that responded to the incident worked on an ""unresponsive, pulseless male,"" according to a Minneapolis Fire Department narrative released by police.

A longer suspension followed the ejection of Ted Hui, who kicked the plastic bottle toward the president's dais after security officers tussled with him and it fell from his hands. (AP Photo) HONG KONG (AP) — China officially ratified a plan Thursday to write a national security law for Hong Kong that exerts Beijing’s broader, new control over the semi-autonomous territory in a bid to prevent a return of the months of often-violent protests last year. The Beijing-backed Hong Kong government sought to assure its citizens that the law would not infringe on their freedoms, while the pro-democracy opposition described the move as the end of the core values that set the former British colony apart from the rest of China. “From now on, Hong Kong is nothing but just another mainland Chinese city,” pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said. China’s ceremonial legislature, ending a one-week annual session curtailed because of the coronavirus, approved a decision by the ruling Communist Party to impose national security laws on Hong Kong. The body’s standing committee, a smaller group with decision-making power, is charged with developing the specific laws against secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs. No timetable has been announced, but they could be enacted at one of its next meetings in June and August. The move marks a definitive end to China’s more low-key approach to Hong Kong over the large-scale protests last year, said Cornell University China expert Allen Carlson. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has come under fire for her handling of the protests, said the decision was welcome because of the difficulty her government faces in passing national security legislation on its own. The city’s constitution requires it to enact such a law, but successive governments have been unable or unwilling to because of opposition. Lam said in a statement that new laws would “sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security” and “not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.” Japan joined the U.S. and other democracies that have criticized the move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan is deeply concerned about the decision “amid strong concerns expressed by the international community and the people of Hong Kong.” Ahead of the decision, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China, setting the stage for the possible withdrawal of preferential trade and financial treatment that the U.S. gives to the former British colony. Pro-Beijing lawmakers said Hong Kong would retain its high degree of autonomy under the “one-country, two systems” framework that has governed the territory since Britain returned it to China in 1997. “We truly believe that this decision made by the National People’s Congress would not harm the rights and freedom that Hong Kong people enjoy,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Martin Liao said. “It could solve the issue of violence and riot and let citizens return to a peaceful and stable life.” As China’s orderly 3,000-member Congress rubber-stamped the move in Beijing, Hong Kong’s legislature was taking on another bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem in a raucous session in which three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected and proceedings halted for about five hours. The legislature’s president, Andrew Leung, suspended the meeting shortly after it began and ejected Eddie Chu for holding up a sarcastic sign about a pro-Beijing lawmaker that read “Best Chairperson, Starry Lee.” A second pro-democracy lawmaker was thrown out for yelling after the meeting resumed, and then a third after rushing forward with a large plastic bottle in a cloth bag that spilled its brownish contents on the floor in front of the president’s raised dais. “We have wanted to use any method to stop this national anthem law getting passed by this legislature, which is basically controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, because the law is just another way of putting pressure on Hong Kong people,” Chu said outside the chamber. He said the legislature’s president had objected to his placard calling Lee an “illegal chairperson” during Wednesday’s first day of debate, so he made a new one that called her the best chairperson instead. Lee was recently elected chair of a key committee that sent the anthem bill to the full legislature for consideration. Her election, which the pro-democracy opposition contends was illegal, ended a monthslong filibuster that had prevented the committee from acting on the bill and other legislation. After the meeting restarted, pro-democracy lawmaker Ray Chan started yelling, and Leung ordered him ejected, too. Then a rushing Ted Hui kicked the cloth bag toward the president’s dais after security officers grabbed him and it fell from his hands. Members left the chamber, security guards sprayed disinfectant and cleaning workers arrived to wipe the carpet. Then firefighters in full protective gear entered and appeared to take samples from the floor using swabs. The meeting didn’t resume until 4 p.m. Hui later described the contents as a rotten plant, and said he wanted Leung to feel and smell the rotting of “one country, two systems” and Hong Kong’s civilization. “I wanted him to taste it, unfortunately it (fell) on the ground because I was hit by security guards,” he said. As the action unfolded, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong applauded Pompeo’s announcement in a separate news conference. Sanctions or the freezing of Hong Kong’s special economic status would “let Beijing know it is a must to completely withdraw and stop the implementation of the national security law,” said Wong, who rose to prominence as a student leader during pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said ahead of Pompeo’s announcement that China would take necessary steps to fight back against any “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.” —- Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

The Michigan appeals court overturned a decision by a Shiawassee County judge and ordered him to sign an injunction sought by state regulators. Karl Manke, 77, said he’s not backing down. He told The Associated Press that he got the news while cutting someone’s hair and he doesn’t intend to comply with it. “I could care less,” he said by phone from his shop in Owosso, about 70 miles northwest of Detroit. “If they want to put me in jail, put me in jail. … I will be governed — fair governing — but not ruled. This is a police state action.” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has kept barbershops and hair salons closed for weeks, citing a high risk of virus transmission as stylists cut hair and people wait for their turn. “Uncontroverted evidence clearly revealed that COVID-19 is a highly communicable illness,” the appeals court said. “Uncontroverted evidence revealed that COVID-19 is spread by infected persons showing no symptoms that could serve to warn others of the possibility of infection.” Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, said he would appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court. Manke reopened his shop on May 4, saying he needed to make money and declaring that the “government is not my mother.” He has been ticketed for violating Whitmer’s orders. Separate from the court case, he’s had his shop and barber’s licenses suspended. Nonetheless, customers have traveled from all over the state to get a haircut and endorse his defiance. Manke gave free haircuts last week during a protest at the state Capitol. Texas hair salon owner Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed for opening her shop, appeared at a rally outside Manke’s business. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into Thursday morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, George pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued Thursday at Minneapolis stores where windows and doors were smashed. TV station KSTP reported that some fires at businesses burned with no firefighters on the scene. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city's 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Protesters also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. By Thursday morning, smoke hung over the city, and looters carried merchandise from a damaged Target store with no interference by police. Video of the store’s interior showed empty clothing racks and shelves and debris strewn about. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd's death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI had already announced that it would investigate whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. On Wednesday, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. Officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk Wednesday night with a bullet wound, police spokesman John Elder said. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody and that the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” Amy Forliti of the Associated Press in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Sign up here. Shortly after China’s legislature endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday, the United States, and governments of Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement arguing the legislation would “curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties."" The first large-scale protests in months erupted in Hong Kong last week when Chinese officials in Beijing announced plans to consider the bill criminalizing anti-government movements, such as the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong’s for most of last year before the coronavirus pandemic. “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom. The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability,” the joint statement released by the State Department Thursday said. “The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people.” CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE China's decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong, rather than through Hong Kong’s own institutions, lies in direct conflict with the United Nations-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration, the statement said. The 1997 agreement handed over Hong Kong, previously a British colony, to Beijing as long as Hong Kong’s people were allowed to retain some liberties not afforded to Chinese citizens. The new law will alter Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, or Basic Law, to require the territory to enforce measures decided by China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) standing committee, a small body controlled by the ruling party that handles most lawmaking. The National People’s Congress, citing national security, almost unanimously approved the bill Thursday, wrapping up an annual session held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls. HONG KONG GOVERNMENT USING CORONAVIRUS AS 'GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY' TO CRACK DOWN ON PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT, ARRESTED ACTIVIST CLAIMS Details will be considered by the Chinese legislature in the weeks to come before the law is expected to go into effect in Hong Kong come September, around the same time as the territory’s scheduled council elections. “We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong,” the joint statement said. “Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year. “The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing's unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.” The U.S., Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have called on China to work together with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo officially declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China, days after Beijing first moved to impose new national security legislation on the territory.

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting.

No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said.

(Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) (CNN) — Minneapolis’ police chief acknowledged Thursday his department had contributed to a “deficit of hope” in the city after the death of George Floyd — and he and other officials called for calm following a night of destructive protests. “I am absolutely sorry for the pain, devastation and trauma Mr. Floyd’s death has left on his family, his loved ones,” Minneapolis and the world, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a news conference. “I know there is currently a deficit of hope in our city … and I know our department has contributed to that deficit as a whole,” Arradondo said. But he also said he cannot allow the kind of looting, fires and business damage that stemmed from street protests Wednesday night. And the city’s mayor said he’s requesting state assistance and allowing Arradondo to use resources from other jurisdictions. “We must confront our shortcomings with humility as well as hope. We must restore the peace so that we can do this hard work together,” Mayor Jacob Frey said. Fury has been rising in Minneapolis over Monday’s death of Floyd, a black man who died after pleading for help as a police officer pinned him — unarmed and handcuffed — to the ground. On Wednesday night, Minneapolis’ second day of protests transitioned to rioting and looting south of downtown, with people smashing their way into stores and setting businesses and other buildings ablaze. One of Floyd’s brothers cried Thursday morning as he said his family wants protests to be peaceful, but stressed people are struggling with seeing another black man die following a police encounter, this one over the passing of an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill at a store. “I want everybody to be peaceful right now, but people are torn and hurt, because they’re tired of seeing black men die,” George Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “These officers (involved in George’s arrest) need to be arrested right now … and held accountable about everything because these people want justice right now,” he said. A man was fatally shot overnight near the protests, police said early Thursday. One person was arrested, and police said they’re investigating the nature of the incident. As the protests developed, demonstrators threw water bottles and firecrackers at officers and a police precinct building. Fires eventually broke out at businesses in the area, including an AutoZone. Flames lit up a building under construction, one floor eventually collapsing. At a nearby Target, video shows people taking cartloads of goods and loading them into their cars. People also raided a grocery store. On Thursday morning its exterior glass lay shattered and the floor was littered with groceries as a interior fire sprinkler system sprayed water. An unspecified number of police officers and other people suffered minor injuries in the protests, Arradondo said, without elaborating. Demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country Wednesday night. In Los Angeles, hundreds of protesters marched. At one point, some attacked a California Highway Patrol car. In Memphis, Tennessee, police in riot gear responded to a protest and at least two people were arrested, CNN affiliate WHBQ reported. The unrest followed shock and anger that spread through communities across the country as bystander video of Floyd’s last moments alive began circulating on social media. The 46-year-old man was arrested Monday evening after, police said, officers were called to investigate alleged forgery at a corner store called Cup Foods. Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, an owner of the store, told CNN a staff member called police to report someone using a fake $20 bill. Police arrived, and Floyd, a suspect in the incident, was handcuffed and pinned on the ground. As he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe, a police officer held him down with a knee on his neck. Three other officers also were at the scene. The Minneapolis Police Department this week fired the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. The cause of Floyd’s death hasn’t been released, and the incident is being investigated by local, state and federal authorities. Floyd’s family wants charges against four officers Floyd, a 46-year-old Houston native, worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He moved to Minneapolis for work and to drive trucks, his friend of more than 20 years, former NBA player Stephen Jackson, said. Jackson said Floyd, a father of two girls, was like a brother to him, and they used to refer to each other as twins. “He was just a great dude … somebody that wanted to be a protector and provider for everybody around him,” Jackson told CNN Thursday. “It sucks that the whole world had to see my friend go that way. … He didn’t deserve that, but the way that people are supportive of him and standing up for him … his death will not be in vain.” No charges have been filed in Floyd’s death, but his family say they want murder charges for all four fired officers. Who the officers are In a news conference Wednesday, Mayor Frey also called for criminal charges to be brought against the officer who kept his knee on Floyd. That officer was identified by his attorney Tom Kelly as Derek Chauvin. Kelly has not released a statement on Chauvin’s behalf. Chauvin had 18 complaints filed with the police department’s internal affairs division, according to MPD. It’s unclear what the complaints, which were all closed, were for and no details were provided by police. Only two of the 18 complaints against Chauvin were “closed with discipline,” according to a public summary from police. The “discipline issued” column listed a letter of reprimand for each of the two complaints. In an interview aired Thursday, Frey told CBS News that he believed Floyd’s death constituted murder. “I am not a prosecutor, but let me be clear: The arresting officer killed someone,” Frew told CBS. “He (Floyd) would be alive today if he were white.” The other three officers were identified by police as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Thomas Plunkett, representing Kueng, said, “At this time, out of respect for Mr. Floyd, we are declining all invitations to discuss these painful events.” Earl Gray is representing another of the officers involved but has declined to say who his client is. Officers told witness Floyd resisted arrest Police said they arrested Floyd Monday after responding to the forgery call and finding him inside a car. Police said he “physically resisted” after he got out of the vehicle. Surveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant shows some of the officers’ initial contact with him and doesn’t appear to show obvious resistance from a handcuffed Floyd. Eventually Floyd is escorted away from view. Donald Williams, a witness, told CNN he was about to walk into a store when he noticed commotion. He said he saw Floyd “panting for his life, begging for his forgiveness.” Williams’ description of events matches a video captured by one bystander in which Floyd can be heard calling for help, saying, “I can’t breathe,” and that his body was hurting. Williams said he tried to approach an officer and ask what was happening. Officers said Floyd was “resisting arrest.” “I said, ‘Officer, he’s not resisting arrest, you have your knee on him and you have handcuffs on him, he’s detained at this moment,'” he said. One officer responded by saying “this is what drugs do to you,” according to Williams. Floyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital a short time later. A medics team that responded to the incident worked on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” according to a Minneapolis Fire Department narrative released by police. Minneapolis police have not yet released bodycam footage from the officers involved.",0.0

Tim Walz called in the National Guard as a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence Thursday, one day after rioting over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of George Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices downtown. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs planned to close early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service “out of concern for the safety of riders and employees,” a statement said. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread to a Target store several miles away in the Midway neighborhood of St. Paul, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store and attempted to take merchandise. St. Paul police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but looting then spread to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement, and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said. By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police’s 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night’s protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. The next day, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country. The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.

Fears of mass retaliation and a sinister spike in violence that would endanger U.S. troops and potentially lead to a full-blown war were instantly ignited. Baghdad threatened to kick the Americans out of the country, and woes of a more profound destabilization ensued, worries that Iran's proxy militias would grow even more out of control grew and many lamented that the blindsiding decision by the American commander in chief would bring animosity between Washington and Tehran to a tipping point. So what, exactly, has been the fallout? ""Once again, the critics of Trump's Iran policy are wrong. There was no WW3 after the removal of the Islamic Republic's most important military official from the battlefield,"" Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News. ""Four months since that game-changing strike, Iran's proxy network continues to operate, but without the charismatic and cunning terrorist who coordinated their efforts. Now is the time to ramp up the pressure on this network."" But as part of its campaign to keep the Soleimani legacy alive, Tehran has this year been steadily building the profile of the dead commander's 28-year-old daughter, Zeinab Soleimani. Little it is known about the general's personal life, other than he is survived by three sons and two daughters, but Zeinab catapulted into the limelight immediately after her father's death, by vowing to large crowds of mourners that ""U.S. soldiers' families will spend their days waiting for the death of their children."" In late January, Zeinab met with Hezbollah leader General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and tweeted a video of the encounter with the caption ""the spider nests of America and Zionists will collapse."" Moreover, she has referred to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Houthi leader in Yemen, Abdalmalek Houthi, as her ""uncles."" In early May, she was appointed by the regime to run the newly established Qassem Soliemani Foundation to maintain his legacy and doctrine, although it remains unclear how that will play out. ""As a revolutionary regime, the Islamic republic is always looking for icons which can be used in its propaganda machine to reproduce its narrative. Zainab Soleimani has all the hallmarks,"" Malik said. ""With minimum cost, she can help indoctrinate young women who are seen as mothers who bring up the next generation of the revolution."" Although crippled by the coronavirus, of which Iran has been the most deeply impacted country in the Middle East, along with its embarrassing and tragic shooting down – and cover-up – of the Ukrainian airliner in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 3 Soleimani slaying, Iran has purported to show strength in other ways. It is what foreign policy experts deem a bid to prove it will not appear feeble under pressure as it postures beneath the murky line of taking pride in its fortitude while playing the victim card. THE MASTER BEHIND THE MASK: WHO IS IRAN'S MOST FEARED AND POWERFUL MILITARY COMMANDER? In late April, Iran ratcheted up its own display of nationalism when it launched a satellite – a move that U.S. officials referred to as a ""provocation"" given that the Defense Intelligence Agency last year reported that space launch vehicles could be utilized as a proving ground ""for developing an ICBM,"" although military analysts have since argued that Iran's machinery is far too limited to serve as an intercontinental ballistic missile. ""The level of Iranian reprisals thus far certainly has not risen to match the significance of the Soleimani killing, but this should not be seen as an indication that Iran has abandoned its desire to seriously harm U.S. interests in the Middle East,"" warned Jordan Steckler, research analyst at United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). ""Even the coronavirus has not fully slowed Iran's malign targeting of the U.S. The regime has followed a familiar playbook, continuing external aggression to distract from its own corruption and ineptitude."" But according to one Iraqi intelligence source, who requested anonymity due to safety precautions, the assassination of Soleimani has had a profound aftereffect. ""Iran really utilized him as a real foreign policy preacher and enforcer across the entire Middle East and Russia and Afghanistan, he was the real boss and had relationships no one else had,"" the source explained. ""The IRCG is not the same. It's going to take them a long while to build that back up and figure who he knew. He did everything his own way and didn't have to ask permission for anything."" Soleimani's replacement in heading the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (ICRG) elite Quds Force unit is Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, and experts contend he has so far shown little of the same clout that his predecessor did. ""Esmail Qaani's portfolio was heavily centered on Quds Force operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" noted Steckler. ""His relationships with Syrian, Lebanese, and Iraqi political and militia leaders aren't as strong as Soleimani's were, and we have seen Hezbollah step in to fill that void in the interim as Qaani gains his footing."" The source also stressed that the killing of Iraq's Shiite militia leader Abu, who was alongside Soleimani as they endeavored to depart the Baghdad airport on that fateful Friday night, has had an equally as resounding impact. ""His death was devastating for Iranian interests, he was the head of the snake, and those under him now really don't know what to do,"" noted the insider. ""All the command he built up has gone."" Several other Iraq officials Fox News spoke to concurred that the effect has been significant. ""The period after the killings has meant a huge split inside the PMF,"" one Kurdish official said. ""They still cannot decide on who to replace Abu Mahdi, Soleimani was the decider for everyone, and he had the final say."" IRAN PICKS CYBER FIGHT WITH ISRAEL AS BOTH SIDES TARGET CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE However, the low-level offensive assaults against U.S. interests by the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq remain ongoing, coupled with Tehran's overarching use of its naval vessels in the Persian Gulf – including live-action training exercises earlier this week – have some policymakers calling for the U.S. to implement an even tighter ""maximum pressure"" campaign. Furthermore, it circumvented the Trump administration's hardline Venezuelan policy against the regime of Nicolas Maduro this week by sending five tankers of gasoline to the increasingly isolated Latin American country. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that all sanctions waivers issued to countries to work with Iran on nuclear projects would be coming to an end within 60 days. Despite the acrimonious rhetoric between Washington and Tehran, so far, it has amounted to little more than tit-for-tat and a far cry from the doomsday predictions that percolated at the beginning of the year. ""Even under coronavirus crisis conditions, Iran is signaling that it will not be deterred,"" Taleblu said. ""Low-level escalation is set to continue.""Others caution that once other distractions such as the coronavirus crisis subside, hostilities could rise again. ""The killing of Soleimani and other 'maximum pressure' tactics have resulted in a more hostile, provocative Iran, not a moderate one. Even though a full-scale war hasn't happened yet, concerns were justified,"" said Defense Priorities Policy Director, Ben Friedman. The killing sparked direct U.S.-Iran conflict, including a missile attack on an Iraqi base housing U.S. forces. It was mostly just luck that the attack didn't kill any U.S. soldiers, providing President Trump an off-ramp to back down from further escalation."" GET THE FOX NEWS APP But over the next few months, analysts highlighted, there is likely to be a lull. A prominent forthcoming date is Oct. 18, 2020, when the United Nations arms embargo 2231 will expire, freeing Iran to take delivery of state-of-the-art combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, and tanks from Russia and China, who are eager to tap into the Iranian defense market. ""While Iran has already violated the arms embargo with seeming impunity, ferrying weaponry to its proxies in combat zones around the region, the resolution has kept the most advanced weaponry out of Iranian hands,"" added Steckler. ""If the resolution lifts, Iran will be able to rebuild its own aging military fleet, and it would strip the U.S. and Israel of justification under international law for its efforts to curtail Iranian arms transfers through interdictions and airstrikes.""",0.0

GEORGE FLOYD UNREST IN MINNESOTA: FEDS, LAW ENFORCEMENT CALL FOR CALM, TIME TO INVESTIGATE AMID RIOTS Videos out of New York show protesters clashing with police, as well as scenes of more peaceful marching and chanting. Some of the protesters hurled bottles at officers, resulting in more than five arrests near Union Square Park, the New York Post reported. In some videos, the crowd can be heard chanting “Black lives matter” or “Hands up, don’t shoot.” In one video, a police officer holding a camcorder repeatedly tells protesters to “back up” as other officers make an arrest behind him and a swarm of masked, young people surround them. Although most of the protesters and police officers can be seen wearing face masks, many in the crowd appeared to flout the city’s social distancing guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic. One Twitter user noted the irony, writing, “very hard to social distance on the steps,” along with a photo that showed a throng of people outside a city building. The New York protests erupted even after the city’s police commissioner, Dermot Shea, condemned the Minnesota incident. “This is not acceptable anywhere,” he tweeted about Floyd’s death. Local and federal investigations are underway in Minnesota into the police officers’ handling of Floyd’s arrest, and U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said Thursday that both President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr were actively monitoring the situation. ‘CENTRAL PARK KAREN’: AMY COOPER SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR FALSE CLAIM, DE BLASIO SAYS In a separate incident in New York this week, a white woman called the police and claimed she was being “threatened” by “an African-American man” in Central Park.

Rioters broke into the precinct around 10 p.m. local time, after police on the rooftop previously tried to disperse a gathering crowd using “flash bang” shots and tear gas, according to reports. Rioters entered the building and sparked the fire after police officers on the roof were rescued by helicopter, reports said. An earlier fire erupted about two blocks from the police station — with no apparent immediate signs of response from the city’s fire department.

(AP/CNN/WISH) — The boyfriend of a Kentucky woman shot by police in her home told a 911 operator “somebody shot my girlfriend” after police burst into the apartment. Kenneth Walker made the call after his girlfriend, Breonna Taylor, was shot by Louisville police. The audio was released to media outlets Thursday. The 26-year-old black emergency medical tech was shot eight times on March 13 after police knocked down the door without knocking during a narcotics warrant search. No drugs were found in the home. Walker can be heard on the call crying and calling Taylor’s name. The release of the call led to a large protest involving hundreds of people in downtown Louisville on Thursday night. Video from the protest was shown on the WISH-TV Facebook page. Last week, the FBI said it has opened an investigation into the shooting death. Robert Brown, special agent in charge for the FBI Louisville, issued a statement Thursday that said in part, “The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner.” She declined further comment on the investigation. The FBI’s confirmation of an investigation came after the Louisville Metro Police Department announced that it would require all sworn officers to wear body cameras and change how the department carries out search warrants. They’re the first steps toward improving police accountability, Mayor Greg Fischer said at a news conference, in which he repeatedly referred to Taylor’s death as a “tragedy.” The shooting also led to the resignation of Louisville Police Chief Steve Conrad.

The Michigan appeals court overturned a decision by a Shiawassee County judge and ordered him to sign an injunction sought by regulators. Karl Manke, 77, said he's not backing down. He told The Associated Press that he got the news while cutting someone's hair and he doesn't intend to comply with it. “I could care less,” he said by phone from his shop in Owosso, about 70 miles northwest of Detroit. “If they want to put me in jail, put me in jail. ... I will be governed – fair governing – but not ruled. This is a police-state action.” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has kept barbershops and hair salons closed for weeks, citing a high risk of virus transmission as stylists cut hair and people wait for their turn. “Uncontroverted evidence clearly revealed that COVID-19 is a highly communicable illness,” the appeals court said. “Uncontroverted evidence revealed that COVID-19 is spread by infected persons showing no symptoms that could serve to warn others of the possibility of infection.” Manke's attorney, David Kallman, said he would appeal to the state's Supreme Court. Manke reopened his shop May 4, saying he needed to make money and declaring that the “government is not my mother.” He has been ticketed for violating Whitmer's orders. Separate from the court case, he's had his shop and barber's licenses suspended. Nonetheless, customers have traveled from all to endorse his defiance. Manke gave free haircuts last week during a protest at the state Capitol. Texas hair salon owner Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed for opening her shop, appeared at a rally outside Manke's business.",0.0

Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Police appeared to have left the building located in the neighborhood not far from where Floyd died Monday. A spokesman didn't immediately respond to messages left by The Associated Press. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can't breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities were boarding up their windows and doors Thursday in an effort to prevent looting, with the Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city's main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the police's 3rd Precinct, the focus of the protests, broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's “Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Earlier Thursday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in the National Guard to try to stem the violence. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. The governor's order did not say how many Guard members were mobilized or whether they would be in service Thursday night. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,” Walz said.",0.0

While many demonstrations have been peaceful, both honoring the late Floyd and the social justice movement, others have left vandalism, fires and looting in their wake. Protesters have breached the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd Precinct and set the building on fire as of reports coming in around 10:30 p.m. Reporter Danny Spewak described the facility surrounded by flames on Twitter. Earlier in the day, people gathered at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of Floyd's death. In one location, Minneapolis artists worked to paint a mural of Floyd. ""Hopefully, it’s a reminder that this should never happen again, and people need to step up in every way that they can to stand up against these corrupt systems,"" said Xena Goldman, one of the artists. In Minneapolis, a powerful moment occurred. An entire crowd just went silent, took a knee and raised a fist in remembrance of George Floyd. Elsewhere, shopkeepers and business owners were forced to clean up in the wake of vandalism and fires that were reported throughout the Twin Cities. In one of the many examples, Gus from Augie’s in downtown Minneapoils off Hennepin Avenue told KARE protesters shattered a door to the BuzzMart despite their pleas. Luckily, he says they, and some of the crowd, deterred anyone from entering. Business owners along Lake Street in south Minneapolis spent Thursday cleaning up debris and boarding up windows after a night of protests, fires, looting and damage. Some business owners in south Minneapolis spent the previous night trying to protect their businesses from looters. Thursday night, as more destruction spread, some businesses placed signs in their windows letting people know they were a minority-owned business. In the wake of mounting tension, Governor Tim Walz announced Thursday he had signed an executive order to activate the Minnesota National Guard at the request of local leadership. Executive Order 20-65 authorizes the guard to work with local government agencies to provide ""personnel, equipment and facilities"" to help respond to the present emergency, according to a news release put out by the governor's office. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” said Governor Walz. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that he had asked Walz to activate the guard to help local law enforcement, as protests escalated into violence and looting overnight Wednesday. In a statement put out on the Minnesota National Guard's Twitter handle, Major General Jon Jensen said, ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond."" The press release also states nearly 200 Minnesota State Patrol troopers, along with State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft, will be at the disposal of state, county and local community public safety agencies. According to the release, the state's response will be conducted from the State Emergency Operations Center. Already activated under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the site will now serve the dual task of helping to coordinate public health needs, as well as addressing safety issues surrounding the evolving tensions in Minneapolis. Frey and other city officials held a news conference earlier Thursday to address protests and unrest happening across Minneapolis. “The emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness,"" Frey said. ""Anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of 5 minutes of horror, but 400 years.” Frey said that in the coming days there will be an all-out effort to restore peace in the city. City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins stepped to the podium and said people have rights to express their anger, but should not do so by causing violence. ""We need peace and calm in our streets and I am begging you for that,"" Jenkins said. ""I have spent the last 41 years as a resident of this city and this is my home. And we cannot allow outsiders or our own Minneapolitan residents to destroy our city. So we want to work together to ensure that people have their voices heard in a safe manner. And that's my commitment."" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he cannot allow criminal acts to threaten the safety of the city. He said he wants to create safe spaces for people to gather and grieve the death of George Floyd. ""I know that our community is in trauma and that they are trying to find ways to heal,"" Arradondo said. ""Even prior to Mr. Floyd's death we have had a community that has been in trauma for quite some time. What I cannot allow as chief is for others to compound that trauma."" Arradondo said most people gathered peacefully but that there were groups of people who were causing destruction. ""The vast majority of people that have come to gather have done so peacefully,"" Arradondo said. He added that there were people involved in the overnight unrest who did not appear to be local. ""There were certainly people who were involved in the activities last night who were certainly not recognized as being part of the city."" Mayor Frey added that businesses that were looted and damaged are ""staples in the community."" ""But more important, in the time of a pandemic they are essential for community needs,"" he said. Multiple buildings, including businesses, homes and a construction site were engulfed in flames Thursday morning as fire crews across Minneapolis worked to contain the blaze. The Minneapolis Fire Department says 911 logs show engines responded to approximately 30 fire events during the unrest along East Lake Street, including at least 16 that involved structures on fire. During those responses engines and equipment suffered damage from rocks and other objects thrown at them. Minneapolis fire personnel remain on scene Thursday putting down active fires and remaining hot spots. Fires broke out at businesses in the area of Lake Street after demonstrations following the police-involved death of Floyd turned chaotic. An AutoZone, a Cub Foods, and an apartment complex under construction were reportedly among the structures impacted by the fires. St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders confirmed that approximately 40 St. Paul officers had been deployed to protect and aid Minneapolis firefighters trying to put down the fires. Reports of looting and property damage began Wednesday night, as a peaceful protest following the death of George Floyd turned ""from bad to worse,"" according to KARE 11's Deevon Rahming, who was on scene for a number of hours. A spokesman for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirms that the mayor has requested the assistance of the National Guard to help regain control of the situation. In other developments, multiple reports say the Rev. Jesse Jackson is headed for Minneapolis, and is expected to hold a news conference around 1 p.m. The Rev. Al Sharpton posted on his Twitter account that he is headed for the Twin Cities as well. Earlier Wednesday, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged people observing or participating in protests to do so with safety in mind. Arradondo says he is supportive of peaceful demonstrations, but says a small minority of those out on the streets are not focused on that, and emphasized that his department will not allow the safety of city residents to be jeopardized.

(AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor’s mother. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Trump tweeted shortly before 1 a.m. Friday. Twitter flagged the tweet, which is now only visible if you click on Twitter’s flag. “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,” the social media company said. After protesters overtook the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct and set it on fire, Trump lashed out at local officials and said the military could take over the response to the protests. “I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership,” Trump tweeted. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying that type of finger pointing is weak. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” Floyd, who is black, was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. He could be heard screaming, “I can’t breathe,” on the video of the incident. The video of Floyd’s death has now caused outrage in the city of Minneapolis and all over the country. Residents of the city have protested his death since Tuesday. This is the second time this week Twitter has taken action against Trump’s tweets. It previously flagged two of Trump’s tweets about mail-in voting in California, saying Trump’s tweets were misleading about elections. Trump responded to the flags by issuing an executive order Thursday targeting social media companies. He said the order allows for new regulations so that social media companies “that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

1620004428,2020-05-29 05:14:33,Minneapolis police station torched amid George Floyd protest,https://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/minneapolis-police-station-torched-amid-george-floyd-protest/,en,True,,649942,TriStateHomepage | WEHT-TV and WTVW-TV,http://www.tristatehomepage.com/home,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. A visibly tired and frustrated Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. For the latest breaking news and stories from across the Tri-State, follow Eyewitness News on Facebook and Twitter.

It’s not just enough to do the right thing yourself. We need to be making sure that all of us are held accountable, to make sure that we’re holding up the highest ideals that we stand by.” Protesters gathered in Minneapolis for the third straight night Thursday to demonstrate against the death of Floyd, a restrained black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes.

Our communities cannot and will not tolerate it,” he said. “These are businesses, these are community institutions that we need.” Frey said he ordered the evacuation of the Third Precinct after it was set on fire. “The symbolism of the building cannot outweigh the importance of life, our officers or the public,” he said, according to FOX 9. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone. And we will continue to patrol the Third Precinct.” In response to the protests, more than 500 members of the National Guard were heading to the Twin Cities region, called in by Gov.

(@mckinley_moore via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor’s mother. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters were shown filming police with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks.

(Provided Photo/CNN) (CNN) — A CNN crew was arrested while giving a live television report Friday morning in Minneapolis — and then released about an hour later — as the crew covered ongoing protests over the death in police custody of George Floyd. State police detained CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, his producer and his cameraman shortly after 5 a.m. CT (6 a.m. ET) as Jimenez was reporting live from a street south of downtown, near where a police precinct was earlier set ablaze. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker that he deeply apologizes for what happened and would work to have the crew released. Jimenez and the others — producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez — were taken to the city’s downtown public safety building, but were released after 6 a.m. CT. Jimenez, after his release, then reported live outside from downtown, and said he’d been treated cordially after he’d been led away. “We’re doing OK, now. There were a few uneasy moments there,” Jimenez said. The crew were handcuffed and detained as Jimenez gave a live report on a Minneapolis street. A line of state troopers had just recently arrived in the area, which city police seemed to have abandoned for hours overnight after the police precinct building was set on fire. Police told the crew they were being detained because they were told to move, and didn’t, one member of the CNN crew relayed to the network. “A CNN reporter and his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights. The authorities in Minnesota, including the Governor, must release the three CNN employees immediately,” CNN said in a statement shortly after their arrest. Officers approached the crew as they moved in to arrest a protester behind them. Jimenez could be seen holding his CNN badge while reporting, identifying himself as a reporter, and telling the officers the crew would move wherever officers needed them to. An officer gripped his arm as Jimenez talked, then put him in handcuffs. “We can move back to where you like. We are live on the air here. … Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way — wherever you want us (we’ll) get out of your way,” Jimenez said before he was led away. “We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection,” Jimenez said. After the CNN photographer was arrested, his camera was set on the ground and continued to transmit live images. Jimenez and the crew had been reporting from the site, near a city police department precinct that protesters had burned and officers had abandoned overnight. About a block away, a fire was burning at a different, four-story building that had contained restaurants. Over 100 state police officers in body armor and riot gear had arrived shortly before 5 a.m. CTand lined up near the area where the CNN crew was, near the precinct building on East Lake Street. For a portion of time overnight — from sometime after city police abandoned the precinct building that was set ablaze — police weren’t in the area until the troopers arrived Friday morning, Jimenez had reported. The four-story event and restaurant building was burning unabated, and people were throwing things into the flames, Jimenez said. CNN’s Josh Campell, who also was in the area but not standing with the on-air crew, said he, too, was approached by police, but was allowed to remain. “I identified myself … they said, ‘OK, you’re permitted to be in the area,'” recounted Campbell, who is white. “I was treated much differently than (Jimenez) was.” Jimenez is black and Latino. Former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said the arrest made no sense. “State police are going to have a lot to answer for this arrest here,” Ramsey said. “(Jimenez is) standing there … you can see his credential. Just move him where you want to be.” “They should have a designated (media) area, and just tell them to move to that area.”",0.0

The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects such as water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported. Videos obtained by the Associated Press show people smashing the building's windows. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from the AP weren't returned overnight. “I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it,” Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted before 9 p.m. “I respect peaceful protests and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.” Earlier Thursday, video showed the crowd marching down Broad Street and blocking High Street, two downtown arteries near the statehouse. As they marched, protesters engaged in a call-and-response chant: “Say his name,"" followed by “George Floyd.” Demonstrators also chanted, “Black lives matter” and “I can't breathe.” The Dispatch reported that protesters dispersed by pepper spray broke windows along South High Street and broke into the DGX store, a subsidiary of Dollar General, on the street. Photographs from the Dispatch showed a smashed storefront at the Einstein Bros. Bagels shop across the street from the statehouse. Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday. His death has touched off protests across the country this week, including in Minneapolis itself, where protesters torched a police precinct Thursday night.",0.0
1620060626,2020-05-29 05:06:36,Police across US speak out against Minneapolis custody death,https://www.wthr.com/article/police-across-us-speak-out-against-minneapolis-custody-death-1,en,True,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Murder. Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this ... turn it in.” There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how “it plays out”.

If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this...turn it in. pic.twitter.com/frNCAWCeq6 — David Roddy (@ChiefDavidRoddy) May 27, 2020 The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ”I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” Not going hide behind “not being there.” I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all. — Chief Eddie Garcia (@sjpdchief) May 27, 2020 But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can't breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. “We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD’s shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death. What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong.  We must take a stand and address it.  We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD.  This is not acceptable ANYWHERE. — Commissioner Shea (@NYPDShea) May 28, 2020 Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are ""not delivering it on a consistent basis.” “When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,” he said. “We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces.”",0.0

The crew was live on television at the time. The police officers, some in riot gear, were seen on camera shoving at least one person before handcuffing CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, and a producer and camera operator. Just before being arrested, Jimenez said, ""Wherever you want us we'll go... Just let us know and we got you."" He continues reporting while an officer held his arm. A second officer grabbed his other arm and said, ""You're under arrest, sir."" ""Can you tell me why I'm under arrest, sir,"" Jimenez said to the officer arresting him. ""Why am I under arrest?"" The officer's response was inaudible.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants, signs and outbreaks of violence, smashing windows and setting vehicles ablaze. In Minneapolis, roughly 1,000 people marched peacefully along the city's major freeway Interstate 35, hours after a curfew went into effect. One black man held a sign that read, ""Am I next?"" Eventually the marchers made it to the 5th Precinct where some demonstrators threw rocks or bottles at police. Latest developments • In one of the most chaotic protests Atlanta has seen in years, demonstrators smashed windows of police cars outside CNN Center, which houses Precinct 5 of the Atlanta Police Department. At least one squad car was set on fire. Police in riot gear helped other force protesters back to Centennial Olympic Park. • Minneapolis and St. Paul are under a curfew but few people paid attention. Around midnight, the state's Department of Public Safety tweeted that 350 troopers are near the 5th precinct in Minneapolis to clear the area and enforce curfew. • In Washington, DC, a protest outside the White House briefly caused the building to be placed on lockdown. It has since been lifted and the Secret Service has reopened entrances and exits to the White House campus for both staff and media. • In New York, protesters and police clashed in various incidents Friday night outside the Barclays Center with protestors throwing water bottles, what appeared to be a bottle of paint and more at police officers. At least 12 people were arrested, police said. • Detroit Police have arrested nine people, one of whom tried to run over an officer with a car, Chief James Craig said. • Protests also took place in at least 25 other cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New Orleans. Floyd's family is angry about the charges On Friday, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman charged Chauvin, the fired police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd's neck, with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His bail has been set at $500,000. Floyd's family and their attorney, Benjamin Crump, are upset that Chauvin wasn't charged with a more serious offense. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" Crump and the family said in a statement. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds in total, and 2 minutes, 53 seconds after Floyd was unresponsive, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. Chauvin and three other officers detained Floyd in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, police have said. Outrage grew in the form of protests after a video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck. The 46-year-old, who was unarmed, cried out that he couldn't breathe. Freeman said charges against the other three officers are likely. ""We entrust our police officers to use certain amounts of force to do their job to protect us. They commit a criminal act if they use this force unreasonably,"" he said. If convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Chauvin would face up to 25 years in prison on the first charge and up to 10 years on the second. Complaint says death was from several factors The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. The report added: ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death."" Read the criminal complaint CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned that the absence of physical evidence doesn't necessarily mean Floyd didn't die from asphyxiation. Gupta also said that an officer should have started CPR after one of them told the others he couldn't find a pulse. CNN has reached out to Chauvin's attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. Tensions boil over in Minneapolis Overnight, the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct was set ablaze. Some protesters chanted Floyd's name and ""I can't breathe,"" and some tossed fireworks toward the precinct, which is the one closest to where the incident was captured on video. State police, donning protective gear and carrying batons, lined up Friday morning near the site littered with debris and sprayed mace at protesters who got too close. Some responded by throwing projectiles at the officers as others fled. Meantime, a CNN crew was released from police custody in Minneapolis after they were arrested Friday during a live broadcast at the site after clearly identifying themselves to officers. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was placed in handcuffs while the cameras rolled, shortly followed by producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez. The state patrol said the crew was ""released once they were confirmed to be members of the media."" CNN disputed that characterization, saying, ""Our CNN crew identified themselves, on live television, immediately as journalists."" ""We're doing OK, now,"" Jimenez said, reporting again from downtown. ""There were a few uneasy moments there."" The Minneapolis Police Department said it evacuated staff from the Third Precinct for safety reasons. Authorities had set up a fence around it, but protesters pushed it over, officials said. City officials warned protesters Thursday night to leave the precinct area, saying it may be in danger of exploding due to ""unconfirmed reports"" of severed gas lines. More than 500 Minnesota National Guard personnel mobilized to several locations in the Minneapolis area, including banks, grocery stories and pharmacies. Another community organizer, Shanene Herbert, told CNN Thursday before the night's events that young people had ""every right to be angry."" ""They have experienced trauma,"" she said. ""Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that."" The Minneapolis mayor criticized the violent incidents. ""What we've seen over the past several hours and the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable,"" Frey told reporters. ""Our communities cannot and will not tolerate it."" The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.",0.0

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Trump tweeted shortly before 1 a.m. Friday. The official White House account reposted the language of President Trump’s tweet Friday morning, which had already been flagged by Twitter. The tweets are now only visible if “view” is clicked. “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,” the social media company said. Without addressing the Twitter guidelines that got his tweet flagged, Trump responded to Twitter saying the social media giant only targets Republicans. “Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party,” Trump tweeted. “They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated.” After protesters overtook the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct and set it on fire, Trump lashed out at local officials and said the military could take over the response to the protests. “I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership,” Trump tweeted. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying that type of finger point is weak. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” Floyd, who is black, was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. He could be heard screaming, “I can’t breathe,” on the video of the incident. The video of Floyd’s death has now caused outrage in the city of Minneapolis and all over the country. Residents of the city have protested his death since Tuesday. This is the second time this week Twitter has taken action against Trump’s tweets. It previously flagged two of Trump’s tweets about mail-in voting in California, saying Trump’s tweets were “potentially misleading” about elections. Trump responded to the flags by issuing an executive order Thursday targeting social media companies. He said the order allows for new regulations so that social media companies “that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

The agency, which typically patrols the nation’s border and ports of entry, said the drone was going to provide live video to assist law enforcement in Minneapolis as they responded to protests that have left dozens of stores burned and looted. A CBP statement issued Friday says the drone would have provided “situational awareness” to local law enforcement. It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. ___ 5:25 p.m. President Donald Trump says he talked to members of George Floyd’s family on Friday and “expressed my sorrow.” Trump spoke about his conversation with members of the Floyd family during a White House meeting with businesses executives. He says of the encounter with police captured on video that “it was just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Trump says the family grieved during the call and that “I could see very much that they loved their brother.” Trump was also asked about his tweet saying “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” He says he had heard that phrase for a long time, but didn’t know where it originated. He says the phrase is “very accurate in the sense that, when you do have looting like you had last night, people often get shot and they die. And that’s not good and we don’t want that to happen.” Trump also spoke about the looters, saying they did a great disservice to their state, city and the country. He said “we can never let that happen again.” The president also says of the city and its mayor “I don’t think they were very well prepared. But we brought in the National Guard. They will be very prepared tonight.” ___ 4:45 p.m. Police in Memphis, Tennessee, are investigating whether an officer broke any rules after a video surfaced of a woman being knocked to the ground during a protest related to the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said on social media Friday that he’s asked Police Director Michael Rallings to investigate “an event that occurred Wednesday night with one of our officers and a female protester.” A video has been shared on television and social media that appears to show an officer shoving a woman to the ground. It’s not clear whether she was injured. ___ 4:15 p.m. NBA veteran Stephen Jackson says he’ll use his platform and “everything I have to get a conviction” for the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired after George Floyd’s death. Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other “twin” because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd’s back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey’s order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he’s “confident justice will be served” after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd’s death were “harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.” The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr’s comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges “must be, and will be, based on the law and facts” and that the process is “proceeding quickly.” He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are “absolutely outlandish.” Selwyn Jones’ nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd’s death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden’s comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called “an open wound” on American society, for Floyd’s death. He says it’s time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, “No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.” ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of “I can’t breathe” in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia’s Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man’s neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, “This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the ‘law enforcement officers’ in the United States.” The ministry called on the U.S. to “to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd’s death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz’s comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd’s death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he’s asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones “brought this upon themselves.” They cited an initial report in Floyd’s case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they’ll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club’s former owner says it’s not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades. Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press that George Floyd had worked there only more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music. Santamaria says she doesn’t believe the two knew each other before their encounter Monday night when the officer was seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Santamaria says that if the officer had recognized Floyd, “He might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria sold the venue within the past two months. She says Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but didn’t like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup. She says a half dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.",0.0
1620178500,2020-05-29 09:58:00,CNN crew released from police custody after they were arrested live on air in Minneapolis,https://www.abc57.com/news/cnn-crew-released-from-police-custody-after-they-were-arrested-live-on-air-in-minneapolis,en,False,,22342,abc57.com,http://www.abc57.com,"CNN crew released from police custody after they were arrested live on air in Minneapolis CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was handcuffed while reporting on Minneapolis protests live on the air Friday. By Jason Hanna and Amir Vera, CNN (CNN) -- A CNN crew was arrested while giving a live television report Friday morning in Minneapolis -- and then released about an hour later -- as the crew covered ongoing protests over the death in police custody of George Floyd. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez told Wolf Blitzer his mother and grandmother were watching when he was arrested with his producer and his photojournalist shortly after 5 a.m. CT. ""As you can imagine, they both were watching on air as this was happening and so in the time I did not have my phone and was being transported to the public safety building downtown, my mom, as I found out later, was calling every single person on the planet basically trying to figure out where I was going,"" Jimenez said, adding that since he had not been booked there was no record of where he was. This worried his mother and grandmother even more. When Jimenez was finally released about an hour later, CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker told him after he got out that ""he made the most important call of my life for me."" ""I assumed it was to the governor, and he said 'No, that most important call of your life was to your mother,'"" Jimenez said. ""He called my mother to tell her and let her know that I was OK."" Jimenez said his grandmother told him that she was arrested during the civil rights movement as a protester. ""She looked at me, almost saying it as a badge of honor, for sticking up for and standing your ground,"" he said. ""I'm thankful to say we were able to do that by doing our constitutionally protected job. At the end of the day there were a lot of scary moments, even more so for my friends and families and loved ones watching what was happening."" Police say CNN crew refused to move State troopers detained Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez shortly after 5 a.m. CT (6 a.m. ET) as Jimenez was reporting live from a street south of downtown, near where a police precinct building was earlier set ablaze. Jimenez could be seen holding his CNN badge while reporting, identifying himself as a reporter, and telling the officers the crew would move wherever officers needed them to. An officer gripped his arm as Jimenez talked, then put him in handcuffs. ""We can move back to where you like. We are live on the air here. ... Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way -- wherever you want us (we'll) get out of your way,"" Jimenez said to police before he was led away. ""We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection,"" Jimenez continued. Police told the crew they were being detained because they were told to move and didn't, one member of the CNN crew relayed to the network. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told Zucker that he deeply apologizes for what happened and would work to have the crew released. Later, after the crew was freed, Walz told reporters: ""We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell the story."" The troopers were clearing the area at Walz's direction, he said, adding there was ""absolutely no reason"" for the journalists' arrests and that he takes full responsibility. Stelter: Arresting reporters at a protest is an affront to the First Amendment Jimenez, Kirkos and Mendez were taken to the city's downtown public safety building after their arrest, but were released after 6 a.m. CT. Jimenez, after his release, reported live outside from downtown and said he'd been treated cordially after he'd been led away. ""We're doing OK, now. There were a few uneasy moments there,"" Jimenez said. The Minneapolis State Patrol said this about the incident: ""In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media."" CNN disputed the state patrol's characterization in a statement on Twitter. ""This is not accurate -- our CNN crew identified themselves, on live television, immediately as journalists. We thank Minnesota @GovTimWalz for his swift action this morning to aid in the release of our crew."" Another CNN reporter says he was 'treated much differently' CNN's Josh Campbell, who was in the area but not standing with the on-air crew, said he, too, was approached by police, but was allowed to remain. ""I identified myself ... they said, 'OK, you're permitted to be in the area,'"" recounted Campbell, who is white. ""I was treated much differently than (Jimenez) was."" Jimenez is black and Latino. Kirkos is white, and Mendez is Hispanic. ""A CNN reporter and his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves -- a clear violation of their First Amendment rights. The authorities in Minnesota, including the Governor, must release the three CNN employees immediately,"" CNN said in a statement shortly after their arrest. Charles Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner and a CNN law enforcement analyst, said the arrest made no sense. ""State police are going to have a lot to answer for this arrest here,"" Ramsey said. ""(Jimenez is) standing there ... you can see his credential. Just move him where you want to be."" ""They should have a designated (media) area, and just tell them to move to that area."" The crew's arrest is a counterpoint, CNN political analyst Bakari Sellers said, to anyone who says, ""All you have to do is comply; all you have to do is use your nice inside voice, and the police will leave you alone."" ""We have a white reporter on the ground, and we have a brown reporter on the ground. They are a block apart. The brown reporter is arrested and the white reporter is telling us what's happening,"" Sellers said. ""We saw a reporter who is educated, who is brown, who is doing his job better than anybody ... (who) was in harm's way, letting the American people see what's going on, on the ground. He complied. He said he would move. ... You almost have to laugh not to just be furious."" What happened before the arrest Hours before the CNN crew's arrest, crowds charged over a fence and threw firecrackers at the Third Precinct building overnight. Minneapolis police officers deserted the building, which eventually was set ablaze. More fires burned, including at a four-story building that had contained restaurants and an event space down the street from the precinct. Police appeared to have abandoned the area for hours. Crowds had thinned, though some people still were throwing things into the burning four-story building, Jimenez reported around 4:30 a.m. CT. Right before 5 a.m. CT, more than 100 state troopers in body armor and riot gear arrived in the area. Firefighters also arrived, spraying water on the burning commercial building. Intermittently, an officer told people over a loudspeaker to ""disperse immediately"" or face arrest. By the time Jimenez was reporting live shortly after 5 a.m. CT, troopers were advancing down the street where Jimenez was standing. The troopers soon approached the three-person crew while moving in to arrest a fourth person behind them. After the crew was detained, Mendez's camera was set on the ground and continued to transmit live images. Journalists assert First Amendment rights to press freedom when covering protests in public spaces, and infringements are relatively rare in the United States. Numerous journalists were detained while covering the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri. At the time, The American Society of News Editors called it a ""top-down effort to restrict"" First Amendment rights. The arrests wound up being embarrassing for the police, and four of the journalists sued St. Louis County. In a settlement deal in 2016, the county agreed ""to adopt policy changes that will address the issues raised by this lawsuit."" Since then, researchers at the US Press Freedom Tracker have counted a handful of other cases of journalists taken into custody while covering protests.

(AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition.

(AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request.

But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” NAPA collapsed, firefighters trying to save that deli next door pic.twitter.com/9OImZILpes — Nick Ferraro (@NFerraroPiPress) May 29, 2020 The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. Fire larger now .

Tim Walz on Friday promised swift justice in the death of George Floyd, but also pleaded with looters and violent protestors who have set fire to Minneapolis to stop, so the city could restore justice and order. “I won’t patronize you as a white man about living those experiences… but I am asking you to help us,” Walz said. “Help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice so that those who are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard, not those who throw fire bombs into businesses.” Walz added that that the looting and violence was counterproductive to the ultimate goal of seeking justice for Floyd and that underlying issues involved in Floyd’s death coud not be addresses until there was calm. “We can’t have it because we can’t function as a society and I refuse to have it take away from the attention of the state,” he said. Walz also referenced Philando Castile and other black people who have died in Minnesota at the hands of police. “Their voices went unheard, and now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world,” Walz said. “And the world is watching.” About a half hour ahead of Waltz’s press conference, President Trump tweeted, “The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!” Floyd, 46, died in police custody Monday night. He had been arrested after an employee at a grocery store called police to accuse Floyd of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd, who is black, was then handcuffed by officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, and pushed to the ground. A cell phone video shows Floyd’s head is turned to the side and he does not appear to be resisting. Chauvin has his knee pressed to the back of Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd is seen gasping for air and begging Chauvin to stop. He does not. Bystanders are also heard shouting at Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd’s neck. Tou Thao, the second officer seen in the video, does nothing as Floyd struggles for several minutes before going limp. Together, Chauvin and Thao have had more than a dozen conduct complaints against them in the past, but have not been formally reprimanded. The two other officers were at the scene were Thomas Lane and Alexander Kueng. All four have been fired. 4 MINNEAPOLIS OFFICERS FIRED IN DEATH OF BLACK MAN AFTER VIDEO SHOWS OFFICER PINNING KNEE AGAINST HIS NECK The video footage of Floyd’s death ignited simmering racial tensions in the city and has shined a light on the use of force by police officers against black residents. In an early morning tweet, Trump vowed military support for the governor following another violent night of protests in Minneapolis, which included a police station being set on fire and a crew from CNN being arrested on air. “I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis,” Trump tweeted. He took that moment to also criticize the city’s democratic mayor. “A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.” He followed up his threat with a tweet that was censored by Twitter. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let this happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and I told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you.” The president’s tweet, which implied that protestors in Minneapolis could be shot, could not be viewed without reading a notice from Twitter that said the president’s tweet violated its rules against glorifying violence. The company also blocked users from liking or replying to the post, though people were still allowed to retweet it if they added a comment of their own. Separately, the state’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, condemned Trump for his late-night tweets and said they stoked the “angry cycle” of violence in Minneapolis. “Calling people thugs and calling on people to get shot stems from the same sort of attitude that resulted in the death of George Floyd,” Ellison said on “CBS This Morning.” He also said Friday he has “every expectation” authorities will press charges against the officers involved in Floyd’s death. “I have every expectation that they will be [filed]” soon, said Ellison, while pointing out that his office is not the place to file charges. Late Thursday, a police spokesman confirmed that staff evacuated the Third Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel.” Video showed protesters entering the building where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as fires were set. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he ordered police to vacate the Third Precinct before it was overrun by protestors. “The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or to the public.” Frey said early Friday, noting that he had made the call after learning that there “were imminent threats.” Protestors could also be seen setting fire to a police department jacket and cheering. Floyd’s girlfriend of three years, Courteney Ross, told the Star Tribune, if Floyd was alive, he would be hearbroken by what was happening in his city. “Waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd,” Ross said. “He loved the city. He came here [from Houston] and stayed here for the people and the opportunities. Floyd was a gentle giant. He was about love and about peace.” Demonstrations against police brutality also spread across to several cities from Memphis and Los Angeles. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP In Louisville, Ky., seven people were shot with one in critical condition after hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the city’s Metro Hall demanding justice for Breonna Taylor. The protest erupted just hours after Mayor Greg Fisher held a town hall about Taylor’s case and community relations with police. On March 13, the 26-year-old EMT was asleep in her Kentucky apartment when she was shot eight times by Louisville Metro Police Department officers who said they were executing a “no-knock warrant,” only they did so at the wrong house. The “trap house” they were looking for was more than 10 miles away from Taylor’s apartment.",0.0

Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case, which sparked protests across the United States and fires and looting in Minneapolis. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wanted all the officers arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into three other officers who were at the scene continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Chauvin allegedly disregarded the worries of the other officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side, according to the criminal complaint. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death, according to the complaint. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get Floyd into the car, but he struggled, the complaint said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the car, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. Lane asked, “Should we roll him on his side?” Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin said, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said that he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a wrist pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home was also picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated Thursday as demonstrators torched a Minneapolis police station that officers had abandoned. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state has taken over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later clarified that he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey took responsibility for evacuating the police precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, said Chauvin’s arrest was “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” Crump had earlier called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Crump said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. State and federal authorities are also investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

The video of Floyd’s death has now caused outrage in the city of Minneapolis and all over the country. Residents of the city have protested his death since Tuesday. Though they have been mostly peaceful, on Wednesday, officials said “a core group of people” not from Minneapolis caused destruction. City leaders have called for the community to voice their outrage in a lawful manner. This story will be updated as protests continue throughout the country. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern: 1:22 p.m.: Officer arrested in connection with Floyd’s death Derek Chauvin, one of the four former officers fired for their involvement in George Floyd’s death, has been taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is scheduled to give a news conference on developments in the case at 2 p.m.  1:09 p.m.: Cops warn of anarchists infiltrating protests ABC News obtained a police bulletin issued to the Philadelphia Police Department and the Delaware Valley Intelligence Center that warned that anarchists and other groups are calling on their supporters to commit acts of violence against police officers in light of the protests in Minneapolis. The bulletin said there have been several social media posts calling for looting and civil disobedience as well as other acts of violence. “Domestic extremists, including anarchist extremists and other anti-government extremists, are using the unrest in Minneapolis to amplify and justify their calls for dismantling law enforcement agencies and carrying out attacks on law enforcement, government, and capitalist targets,” the bulletin said. The bulletin stressed that non-violent protests are legal and protected by the Constitution. “Anarchist extremists may be attracted to this call to action and engage in direct action against law enforcement property, such as buildings and vehicles, in order to draw attention to their cause,” it said.  12:56 p.m.: Obama offers statement on George Floyd of our darkest chapters’ Former President Barack Obama issued a statement on social media about Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests in Minneapolis. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” he wrote. “It can’t be ‘normal.’ If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.” Obama said it is up to Minnesota officials to ensure that Floyd’s death is fully investigated and justice is ultimately done, however, he encouraged people “to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”  12:40 p.m.: Governor calls on order to be restored after ‘one of our darkest chapters’ Gov. Tim Walz called the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests that took place have been “one of our darkest chapters.” However, he said he refused to let those who caused destruction to Minneapolis “take away the attention of the stain that we need to be working on” and pleaded with the community to help restore order. Walz said that the “looting and recklessness” that occurred was not caused by those who wanted justice for Floyd. “We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues,” the governor said, later calling one of the issues “fundamental institutional racism.” He said that he would not “patronize” the black community as a white man, but asked the community to “help us use a humane way to get the streets back to a place where we can restore justice.” Walz started off his press conference by acknowledging generations of pain and anguish that communities of color in America have experienced. He said that those communities have not been truly heard, “much like we failed to hear George Floyd as he pleaded for his life, as the world watched, by the people sworn to protect him, his community, our state.” The commissioner for the state’s Department of Public Safety called Floyd’s death “murder.” “That’s what it looked like to me,” Commissioner John Harrington said. His comment marked the first time a member of law enforcement call Floyd’s death murder publicly. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison began his remarks by quoting Martin Luther King Jr., saying “riot is the way that the unheart get heard.” He said King urged people not to dismiss non-peaceful protests or relegate it as criminality, but ask what was really going on there. Ellison said that protesters should not react to the National Guard in the way that may react to the Minneapolis Police Department. He noted they are two different agencies and “their job is trying to bring peace and calm back again.” Ellison said that although people continue to ask when justice will be served, he believes authorities understand that “the wheels of justice must turn swiftly.” He also said that while the investigation and criminal procedure for this case is important, it by no means addresses the root of these problems in this country. “I think we’re gonna do some real change. … We’re not just gonna fix the windows and sweep up the glass. We’re gonna fix the broken, shattered society that leaves so many behind.” 11:10 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights. Jenkins said that the anger of the community has been expressed and she did not want further action to lead to injuries or loss of life. “We can’t allow this type of civic unrest to continue,” she said. Jenkins on Thursday called on city officials to declare racism a public health crisis. “By declaring racism a public health emergency it provides us the opportunity to name the virus that has infected our American institutions for centuries but in addition, it gives us the opportunities to … you can’t really begin to cure a disease until you know what that disease is,” she said. “It’s an infectious disease just like the coronavirus and it’s not just Minneapolis.” 11 a.m.: Trump says National Guard is in Minneapolis President Donald Trump tweeted that the National Guard is now in Minneapolis. “They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared,” the president wrote. “George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!” The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Photos showed members of the National Guard in the streets of Minneapolis. Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Thursday activating the Minnesota National Guard after Wednesday night’s destructive protests. 10:50 pm.: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden said he was “furious” over President Donald Trump’s tweet on the protests “I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too,” Biden wrote. Trump tweeted in the early morning hours of Friday that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” referring to the protests. He also called protesters “thugs.” Enough. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 29, 2020 Biden said that he will be speaking more later today about the situation in Minneapolis. He also addressed a CNN crew being arrested. “This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything,” Biden said, with the swift action appearing to refer to their release. 10:20 a.m.: Melania Trump says there is ‘no reason for violence’ First Lady Melania Trump said the nation needs to focus on healing and “there is no reason for violence.” “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she tweeted. “I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now.” Trump also offered her “deepest condolences” to Floyd’s family. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing,” the first lady wrote.  Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 29, 2020 10:09 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights.

It won’t be easy, but it’s essential,” Crump wrote on Twitter. If only I were surprised by this hypocrisy. Minneapolis PD arrests journalists but not murderers from within its own ranks. These problems will require systematic change to start the healing process. It won’t be easy, but it’s essential. https://t.co/2wC3qxLWFT — Benjamin Crump, Esq. (@AttorneyCrump) May 29, 2020 6:59 a.m.: CNN reporter, crew arrested live on air CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his production crew were arrested in Minneapolis live on air Friday morning while reporting on the Floyd protests. The news outlet is reporting that police said they were arrested because they were told to move and didn’t. “A CNN reporter & his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves – a clear violation of their First Amendment rights,” CNN said in a statement Friday morning. “The authorities in Minnesota, incl. the Governor, must release the 3 CNN employees immediately.” Minnesota State Sen. Jeff Hayden phoned into CNN and said he just had a joint text with the governor and mayor and that they were just trying to get control of the area and weren’t aware of the CNN reporter getting arrested. “Hoping that we can figure it out,” Hayden said. 6:44 a.m.: 70 arrested or summonsed in New York City during George Floyd protests At least 70 people were arrested or summonsed during a series of protests that started in Union Square and spread through Lower Manhattan through Thursday night. Most will be summonsed for obstruction of governmental administration and social distancing violations, but there will also be assault and weapon possession charges. The protest began in Union Square after 3 p.m., Thursday but after that broke up, protests reemerged at Foley Square courthouses, City Hall and Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest, and moved toward the West Side Highway. Several police officers were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one with a possible concussion. One person was arrested for assaulting a police officer for throwing a garbage can into a crowd and striking a police officer in the head. Another person attempted to grab the service weapon from a Deputy Inspector’s holster. That person will be charged with robbery. 1:15 a.m.: Trump says military could assume control in city, ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’ President Donald Trump weighed in on the destructive protests in Minneapolis early Friday morning, saying the military could “assume control” of the response. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also attacked Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying the protests are a result of a lack of leadership. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right,” Trump tweeted. Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying it’s weakness to point fingers during times of crisis. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” 12:48 a.m.: Minneapolis asks residents to ‘retreat’ over precinct explosion possibility After people protesting George Floyd’s death forcibly took over a Minneapolis precinct and began to ignite fires, city officials are now warning residents to leave the area in case the building explodes. “We’re hearing unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the Third Precinct have been cut and other explosive materials are in the building,” the city tweeted. “If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes.” Frey said residents must clear the area so the fire department can put out fires. “We are working with @MinneapolisFire to deliver resources and respond for a beloved neighborhood in our city,” Frey tweeted. “We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.” The Minnesota National Guard has been activated for the area and said it’s helping the fire department safely get to fires to help them battle the blazes. Since the protests started, the Saint Paul Police Department said more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted. Despite the destruction, with dozens of fires set, authorities said there are no reports of serious injuries. “Calm on the horizon,” the department said late Thursday night. 12:32 a.m.: Governor ‘shocked’ after vehicle attempts to run over protester Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is “absolutely shocked” by video of a car attempting to run over a person protesting the death of Floyd in Denver on Thursday. What started as a peaceful protest turned chaotic with reports of vandalism and violence. “Tonight is a very sad night for our state. While we are still uncovering all of the facts, a protest regarding the killing of George Floyd devolved into vandalism and violence, and I was absolutely shocked by video evidence of a motorist attempting to run over a protestor,” Polis tweeted. “Coloradans are better than this. I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” Previously shots were fired across the street from Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver. 11:51 p.m.: Protesters gain access to police precinct  People protesting the death of Floyd have reportedly taken over the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct and set it on fire, according to authorities. Minneapolis Police spokesperson John Elder said staff was evacuated from the building around 10 p.m. local time and that protesters forcibly entered the building and ignited several fires. Shortly after reports of the precinct takeover, the Minnesota National Guard said it was deploying more than 500 soldiers to the area. “We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,” the National Guard said in a statement. “Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls.” 9:20 p.m.: Colorado protest marred by gunshots Protesters outside Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver received a scare when someone apparently fired shots nearby, causing the assembled group to flee. There were no injuries, authorities confirmed to ABC News. “Officers on scene at W Colfax Ave and W 15 st on shots fired in the area of the Capital. This is an ongoing investigation and the motive is unknown,” Denver police wrote on Twitter. Leslie Herod, who is a state representative, tweeted about the incident as well. She added that someone was apprehended, though police have not confirmed any arrests. The Capitol was put on lockdown, with Herod, who fled inside included. Herod told an ABC News producer she was not scared by the incident. “No. This only makes me more resolved. We have more work to do,” she said. 8:31 p.m.: 911 call released The 911 call made by the store owner who accused Floyd of using fraudulent money was released by authorities Thursday evening. According to the transcript of the call released by the state of Minnesota, the caller — a store owner — told the operator that Floyd entered the store drunk and tried to pay for something with “fake bills.” He later left the shop and sat on his car. It was there where police found him when they arrived at the scene. “Someone comes [to] our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was [sic] sitting on their car,” the caller said. “We tell them to give us their phone, put their… thing back and everything, and he was also drunk and everything and return to give us our cigarettes back and so he can, so he can go home but he doesn’t want to do that, and he’s sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” The operator then asked the caller for Floyd’s race and sex. “No, he’s a black guy,” the caller replied. “Alright,” the operator said, letting out a sigh according to the transcript, before the caller asked, “How is your day going?” 6:25 p.m.: Investigation is ‘top priority’ for DOJ The Department of Justice has made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority,” Erica MacDonald, attorney for state of Minnesota, said at a press conference. MacDonald said President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr are “directly and actively” monitoring the case. “It is critical, it is essential, it is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time,” she said. “And that is what we are going to do.” No federal or state charges against the officers were announced at the press conference. Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman asked for “patience.” “Give us the time to do this right and we will bring you justice — I promise,” Freeman said. He said his office has been flooded with calls on the status of the investigation. The main question, he said, has been, “what’re you gonna do about the murder of George Floyd?” “We are going to investigate as thoroughly as justice demands,” Freeman said. He called the officer’s action “excessive and wrong,” but said he needs to determine if it was criminal. Both MacDonald and Freeman called on the public to come forward with any information they may have. There was a delay in starting the press conference, which MacDonald apologized for and said she was hoping to share a development but that it was not the right time. 5:35 p.m.: City releases complaint history of 4 officers The police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was involved in 18 complaints prior to being fired, according to records released by the city. Derek Chauvin, who was fired following Floyd’s death, was only disciplined for two of those complaints, according to the city records. The documents do not provide the details of the complaints or the disciplines. Tou Thao, who was the officer seen standing up in the video, had six complaints, one of which remains open, according to the records. Thao, who was also fired, was not disciplined for the other five complaints. The other two officers who were fired, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, have had no complaints. 5:15 p.m.: Governor signs executive order activating National Guard Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard following Wednesday night’s protests. Walz said the purpose of the National Guard was “to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.” “The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,” he said in a statement. “While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved.” The National Guard Adjutant General will work with local government agencies to provide personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to respond to and recover from the protests, according to Walz’s office. There will also be about 200 members of the Minnesota State Patrol that will work with state, county, and local community and public safety partners. State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft on the ground will assist law enforcement officers, the governor’s office said. 5:03 p.m.: Families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery issue joint statement The families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery — all of whom died after incidents with current and former law enforcement — are demanding change and calling for government action to address this “national crisis.” “We’re devastated about the senseless violence that has broken the hearts of our families,” the families said in a joint statement. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive. This is a national crisis and our government needs to take immediate and widespread action to protect our black and brown communities.” The families have called for a congressional hearing and a national task force to create new bipartisan legislation that is aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability. They will also present a case to United Nation Human Rights Committee for sweeping changes to the nation’s criminal justice system. A date for when they would be presenting their case was not provided. Taylor, a black woman, was a front-line worker who died after a police-involved shooting. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping inside their Springfield Drive apartment on March 13 when officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department attempted to execute a “no-knock” search warrant. Three plainclothes officers opened Taylor’s front door and “blindly” opened fire into their apartment, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in April by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Taylor was shot at least eight times and died. Arbery, a black man, was out for a jog when two white men saw him and set off to confront him, police said. The men, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, were armed. A video shows Arbery and Travis McMichael tussling with the shotgun before three shots are fired. Arbery stumbled and fell to the ground, where he was pronounced dead. City leaders react to protests The mayor, police chief and city council vice president in Minneapolis emotionally addressed the violent protests that took place Wednesday night over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point became choked up and tearful, said that the protests were “the result of so much built up anger and sadness.” “Anger and sadness that has been engrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years,” Frey said at a press conference. “If you’re feeling that sadness and anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he knew that there was a “deficit of hope” in the community and that his department has contributed to that deficit. He also said that the violence and destruction seen in Wednesday night’s protest was mostly caused by a “core group of people” who were not from Minnesota. He said that most of the community members who have been protesting since Floyd’s death Monday have been peaceful. Arradondo said he wanted to ensure that people could safely protest, but he said he could not allow for criminal acts. Wednesday night’s protest caused destruction and chaos in Minneapolis, including a deadly shooting, looting and multiple fires. The protests, which had been largely peaceful up until Wednesday night, were in wake of Floyd’s death after he was apprehended by Minneapolis police Monday. Disturbing video emerged on social media showing a police officer with his knee on the man’s neck as the man repeatedly yells out, “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe, please, the knee in my neck,” the man said in a video showing a police officer pinning him to the ground. “I can’t move … my neck … I’m through, I’m through.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins sang “Amazing Grace” at Thursday’s press conference before addressing the protests. Jenkins said she wanted to offer “amazing grace” and her condolences to the Floyd family. “We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks, a knee that says black lives do not matter,” Jenkins, who is black, said. “I am part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks.” Jenkins, Frey and Arradondo said they would be working with the community leaders. A “healing space” will be created at the 3rd Precinct in Minneapolis for residents to express their concerns and anger in a safe and humane way, Jenkins said. Overnight developments Police said during the protests they responded to a call of a stabbing victim and found a man in grave condition near the protests. The man later died in the hospital and authorities learned he died from a gunshot wound, according to John Elder, the director of communication for Minneapolis police. One person was in custody after the shooting, police said. It was not immediately clear what led to the shooting, but the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the owner of a pawn shop opened fire on a man he believed was burglarizing his business and fatally shot him. Police said multiple businesses were looted during the protests and the city’s fire department said there were 30 intentional fires during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires. Massive flames were seen in the sky on videos that circulated throughout social media. As of Thursday afternoon, the fire department said crews were still extinguishing fires along East Lake Street. People were also throwing rocks at fire department vehicles responding to the scene, according to the fire department, which noted there were no firefighter injuries. Elder had said people were throwing rocks at firefighters. Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, wrote on Twitter the family thanked the protesters and wanted peace in Minneapolis, but “knows that Black people want peace in their souls — and until we get #JusticeForFloyd there will be no peace.” “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors and endanger each other as we respond to the necessary urge to raise our voices in unison and in outrage,” Crump wrote Thursday morning. “Looting and violence distract from strength of our collective voice.” Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 — Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 28, 2020 The city requested assistance from the National Guard late Wednesday during the protests, according to ABC Saint Paul affiliate KSTP. The National Guard did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment. “Tonight was a different night of protesting. Last night we had 8,000 protestors all peaceful. Tonight we did not have that,” Elder said. Elder said that there were no serious injuries to officers. He was not sure about the number of people arrested. The fire department said there were no civilian injuries from the fires. Gov. Tim Walz urged people to leave the area as the situation escalated. “The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone’s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene,” Walz wrote on Twitter. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also asked people to evacuate the area. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” Frey wrote on Twitter. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing Floyd’s death. On Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office were conducting a “robust” criminal investigation into his death. “The federal investigation will determine whether the actions by the involved former Minneapolis Police Department officers violated federal law. It is a violation of federal law for an individual acting under color of law to willfully deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” according to a joint statement from United States Attorney Erica MacDonald And FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen. The officers involved in the incident were identified by police as Officer Derek Chauvin, Officer Thomas Lane, Officer Tou Thao and Officer J Alexander Kueng. All four officers were fired, according to Frey. “This is the right call,” the mayor said. The Minneapolis Police Department said Monday that officers were initially called to the scene “on a report of a forgery in progress” in a statement on their website. The statement added that officers were advised that the suspect “appeared to be under the influence” and that he “physically resisted officers.” He later “appeared to be suffering medical distress” and officers called an ambulance. He was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance, “where he died a short time later.” The police department said there were no weapons of any type used by anyone involved in the incident and no officers were injured.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd's neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd's death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world -- and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage about Floyd’s death and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd's family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd's body to have an independent autopsy performed. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told the Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the last two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup, and and a half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass of the Associated Press in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0
1620442284,2020-05-29 13:26:11,"Former Minneapolis police officer charged with third-degree murder, manslaughter  in George Floyd death",https://www.wthr.com/article/former-minneapolis-police-officer-charged-third-degree-murder-manslaughter-george-floyd,en,False,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (KARE) — Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin is charged with third degree murder, but they are continuing to review evidence and there may be subsequent charges later. Freeman said they focused on the ""most dangerous"" perpetrator first, but the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest are under investigation and he anticipates charges against them as well. Multiple sources confirmed to KARE 11 that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading, ""I can't breathe."" ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said, referring to the video as ""horrible, horrific, terrible."" He said that in addition to that bystander video, they have officers' body-worn cameras, witness statements, the preliminary Medical Examiner's report, and expert opinions as evidence. ""Normally these cases take nine months to a year,"" Freeman said. ""We have to charge these cases very carefully because we have the difficult burden of proof."" When asked whether public unrest factored into the speed, Freeman said, ""I’m not insensitive to what’s happened in the streets."" But he maintained that his job is to charge when his office has ""sufficient evidence."" ""I will not allow us to charge a case before it is ready,"" Freeman said. ""This case is now ready, and we have charged it."" Freeman said that the charges are the same ones levied against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. A full complaint is expected to be released Friday afternoon. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a statement in response to the charges Friday, saying, ""We are a nation at a crossroad, and today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city."" ""What's happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,"" said Frey. ""For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."" Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced earlier Friday during a different news conference that Chauvin had been arrested. The BCA confirms that he was taken into custody at 11:44 a.m. Friday in Minneapolis. Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis ""who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder."" ""I don't want to prejudice this,"" he said regarding using the term ""murder."" ""I'm just calling it like I see it."" ""I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe."" Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. ""We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,"" he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I'm asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap. State Attorney General Keith Ellison quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., when he asked Minnesotans not to disregard riots as only senseless violence. ""Ask yourself, what's going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. ""Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,"" Frey said. ""We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.""

We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” In St. Paul, fires burned in buildings across the street from Allianz Field. According to a post from the Saint Paul Police Department, more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted along with dozens of fires. Firefighters working to put out flames at multiple buildings across from Allianz Field in St. Paul’s Midway neighborhood. @kare11 pic.twitter.com/tmx2Y3Fmam — Jennifer Austin (@jenniferfaustin) May 29, 2020  President Trump also weighed in on Twitter late Thursday night, blaming the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter has since removed a portion of the president's tweet, citing violations of their user policy for glorifying violence. Trump tweeted again Friday saying, ""The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!""",0.0

Officers fired pepper balls. Protesters clashed with police in downtown Indianapolis Friday night in an hours-long demonstration that started peacefully but turned violent after the sun went down. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department used multiple volleys of tear gas and pepper balls in an attempt to disperse crowds of people who lingered on city streets well past midnight. As police stood in riot gear, groups of protesters moved through clouds of gas chanting “I can’t breathe!” and “Black lives matter.” Shattered windows and glass doors were seen on many businesses, including Circle Centre Mall. An IMPD patrol car was vandalized. Fires were set in trash cans. A CVS store was torched and looted. Other stores, including a jewelry store and a cellphone store, were also looted. Graffiti on a broken window at Key Bank at Market Tower read, “I can’t use my bank account if I’m dead.” Just before 12:30 a.m., a police spokesperson said shots had been fired at a Marion County Sheriff’s Department deputy at 1 American Square, near Illinois and Ohio Streets. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire, IMPD said. The shooter was not in custody. The anger spilling into Indianapolis streets was mirrored in city after city across the country Friday as civil unrest grew four days after George Floyd died in Minneapolis. The White House was put on lockdown. Minnesota’s governor enacted an 8 p.m. curfew in the Twin Cities after violent protests resulted in fires, looting and the abandonment of a police station overrun with protesters. In Atlanta, crowds set fire to police cars, threw rocks and smashed glass at CNN’s headquarters. Seven people were shot overnight Thursday in Louisville during violent protests in that city. Here in Indianapolis, the protest started peacefully, with just a couple of dozen people who gathered to decry Floyd’s death and also remember 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed. Reed was fatally shot three weeks ago by a black IMPD officer following a police pursuit that was broadcast live on Reed’s Facebook. The investigation into the shooting is still ongoing. Those protesting Friday afternoon held signs that said “Justice for Dreasjon Reed,” “Black lives matter” and “End white supremacy.” Some carried posters remembering Ahmaud Abery, a 25-year-old black man who was killed in February while jogging through a predominately white neighborhood in Georgia. No arrests were made in that case for months until a white father and son were charged with murder and aggravated assault in early May. Others at the demonstration recalled Breonna Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police. They wrote Reed, Floyd, Abery and Taylor’s names in chalk on the red bricks surrounding the Soldiers and Sailors Monument downtown. Lamari Edwards, 20, told IndyStar that Floyd's and Arbery's deaths brought her to the Friday protest, but she said Reed’s death also hit home for her. “It’s shocking to me that he was killed so effortlessly,” she said. Event organizers worked hard to keep the protesters calm in the early hours of the demonstration. Those who threw water bottles at police officers midafternoon were asked to leave. A local Black Lives Matter group broadcast repeatedly on Facebook Live and called on ""white allies"" to move to the front to form a human barrier between black protesters and the assembled police officers. Many responded, linking arms and shouting ""No justice! No peace!"" It’s unclear what caused the protests to turn violent after dark. By midnight, the demonstrations didn’t appear to be organized in any way. Police continued to try to break up the knots of people in the streets and on the sidewalks to little avail. Further protests are scheduled later Saturday. Contact IndyStar reporter Crystal Hill at 317-444-6094 or cnhill@gannett.com. Follow her on Twitter: @crysnhill.",0.0

Pence said in a tweet, ""Our prayers are with the family of George Floyd and our prayers are also with the family of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. We have no tolerance for racism in America."" A follow-up tweet continued: ""We believe in law and order in this Country. We condemn violence against property or persons. We will always stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest and let their voices be heard."" Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before Floyd, a black man, died. The arrest came after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. But in the past, Pence has turned his back on peaceful protest. In October 2017, the former Indiana governor tweeted that he walked out of Lucas Oil Stadium after a group of San Francisco 49ers players knelt during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and social injustice. ""I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence tweeted minutes after leaving the stadium. According to documents released by the Huffington Post from the Department of Homeland Security a year after the walkout, the estimated cost of Pence's visit was about $325,000. The numbers include hotel, travel and additional security measures. Earlier that same year, he seemed to take another silent protest in stride when roughly 100 University of Notre Dame graduates walked out during Pence's commencement speech. The vice president spent a chunk of his 15-minute address discussing his support for freedom of speech at universities and said, “sadly, when free speech and civility are waning on campuses across America, Notre Dame is a campus where deliberation is welcomed, where opposing views are debated, and where every speaker, no matter how unpopular or unfashionable, is afforded the right to air their views in the open for all to hear.” Pence didn’t acknowledge the walkout directly, but continued to discuss expression on college campuses. . “The increasing intolerance and suppression of the time-honored tradition of free expression on our campuses jeopardizes the liberties of every American,” he said. “This should not and must not be met with silence.” Contact IndyStar reporter Elizabeth DePompei at 317-444-6196 or edepompei@indystar.com.

(WPTA21) - With chants of ""I can't breathe,"" and ""George Floyd,"" protesters filled the Allen County courthouse green Friday evening to make their voices heard. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of ""I can't breathe"" in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. The organizer of the protest said she organized the event in direct response to his killing. Organizer Alisha Rauch said protesters are welcome to bring signs, march, or chant, but reminds participants to keep it peaceful. ""We want to be heard! We want to be United as one and we demand justice! Blacks in America should not fear for their lives! We feel white supremacy is the largest terrorist in the United States and they are praying on our black brothers and sisters!"" Rauch said in a message to ABC21 The officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes has now been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. Drivers passing by the Fort Wayne event honked their horns in support. A second protest is planned for Saturday at 2 p.m., also on the courthouse lawn downtown.

1620497215,2020-05-29 17:56:26,Analysis: Trump fuels new tensions in moment of crisis,https://wpta21.com/2020/05/29/analysis-trump-fuels-new-tensions-in-moment-of-crisis/,en,True,,127044,indianasnewscenter.com,http://indianasnewscenter.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Over 48 hours in America, the official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic topped 100,000, the number of people who filed for unemployment during the crisis soared past 40 million, and the streets of a major city erupted in flames after a handcuffed black man was killed by a white police officer. It’s the kind of frenetic, fractured moment when national leaders are looked to for solutions and solace. President Donald Trump instead threw a rhetorical match into the tinderbox. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he declared ominously in a late-night tweet. Trump’s words were so jarring that Twitter attached a warning to his post — as well as to an identical message from an official White House account — saying that the president of the United States was “glorifying violence.” It’s the first time the social media giant has taken such a step with any world leader, prompting new claims of bias from Trump and some of his conservative allies. The episode encapsulated Trump’s approach to the presidency and to this time of national crisis, which has upended nearly every aspect of American life and put his November reelection prospects at risk. He’s latched on to personal grievances and cast himself as a victim, while making only occasional references to the staggering loss of life across the country. He’s willingly stoked partisan divisions over public health, and now racial divisions in the face of a death, rather than seeking opportunities to pull the nation together. To Trump’s detractors, none of that should come as a surprise at this late stage in his term, which has been defined by such responses at volatile moments. “I had hoped that at least for this one time, some of the president’s advisers would get to him and try to convince him to be consoler-in-chief,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat from Missouri. “President Trump was not built for times like this.” Many Republicans were silent about the president’s remarks. Several contacted by The Associated Press either did not respond to questions about whether Trump was appropriately meeting this moment of cascading national crises or would not speak about the matter on the record. Trump’s campaign issued a statement accusing Democrats and the media of twisting Trump’s words and trying to “make money”— an assertion the campaign did not explain. The death of George Floyd, a black Minnesota man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, added a new element of anxiety to an already nervous nation. Millions of Americans have been largely confined to their homes for weeks as the COVID-19 virus swept through the country and 100,000 people have died, according to official estimates which are believed to be lower than the real toll. The economy has cratered as a result and is unlikely to recover quickly even as some of the most restrictive stay-at-home orders start to ease. Trump has frequently sided with law enforcement during officer-involved deaths. But he struck a different tone in his initial reaction to Floyd’s death, calling the video a “very shocking sight.” The Department of Justice called the investigation into his death a top priority. As protests in Minneapolis escalated, Trump shifted toward his more typical posture, describing those taking to the streets as “THUGS” in the tweet that was flagged by the company. His warning in the same message about shooting echoed a phrase used by a Miami police chief in the 1960s during aggressive crackdowns on unrest in black neighborhoods. Trump “crashed with this statement in showing who he really is,” said Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network. “This is dangerous, this is ugly, this is provocative.” The president tried to explain away the comments on Friday, saying in a new tweet that he was stating “a fact” that people can be shot when looting happens. During a later appearance at the White House, he said he understood the hurt and pain but the situation in Minneapolis should not “descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos.” At a moment when many Americans are looking to their leaders, Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic challenger in the November election, tried to step into the breach. In remarks from his Delaware home, where he has remained throughout the pandemic, Biden offered condolences to Floyd’s family and said it was no time to encourage violence in America. “We need real leadership right now, leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism,” Biden said. One week ago, Biden was the one facing criticism for comments he made about race after he said in a radio interview that African Americans who don’t support him over Trump “ain’t black.” Biden, who surged to the Democratic nomination on overwhelming support of black voters, quickly walked back that remark. Trump’s campaign, which has been making targeted appeals to black voters, seized on Biden’s remarks. But the attention, as it so often does, shifted quickly back to the president. Democrats are eager to keep it there, urging Americans to envision four more years of Trump’s responses to racially charged episodes, as well as the health and economic crises roiling the country. “The nation is on fire, and the president of the United States is standing there with gasoline,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, a contender to become Biden’s running mate. ___ AP writers Aamer Madhani and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

Protestors gathered at the Civic Plaza in downtown Elkhart on Friday evening. “I’m very sad,” Dwight Fish said, Councilman, city of Elkhart. “I don’t believe that it should have happened.” “United we stand” is the goal of the protest, according to the event Facebook page. It is all about bringing the people of Elkhart together, according to Fish. “They weren’t listening,” Fish said. “Tonight in Elkhart, we’re listening to each other. We’re going to listen to the hurt that’s in peoples’ hearts.” That hurt stemmed from the recent death of George Floyd, the man who died after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck. The incident has sparked outrage across the country. “We’ve got to help the national situation heal and in Elkhart, we’re going to be the social conscious of the nation tonight,” Fish said. Fish called the protest a vigil and a chance for solidarity. “This is, this is not going to be a gathering of anger,” Fish said. “This is a showing of love toward our fellow man and the people of Minneapolis. This is where people have to show their humanity, their compassion toward one another.” Elkhart Police Chief, Chris Snyder, issued the following statement: ""The Elkhart Police Department feels and understands the frustration and hurt being felt throughout our community. We are thankful for the support we receive from our community and their willingness to work together to make the police department, our officers and the community stronger and more unified. The Elkhart Police Department respects the right to gather for a display of support, to mourn and to celebrate and only ask that gatherings are conducted peacefully and professionally.” Katie Pickard, a resident of Elkhart, joined the protest to pay her respects. “A lot of people get together locally, show support for our black community…let them know that they do have a voice; they’re not alone. We stand with them in any way that we can,” Pickard said. “We’re going to show the world, we’re going to show the United States that we’re better than that here in Elkhart that we’re coming together for peace and love,” Fish said.

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump spent Friday walking back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump’s later repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

His initial open date in March had to be pushed back because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was ready to finally open his doors in June, but that plan came to a crashing halt when rioters destroyed his business on Wednesday. “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” a teary-eyed Balla told a CBS affiliate. The outlet reported that Balla invested his life savings into opening the bar which looters infiltrated as cameras were rolling. “We’ve been working so hard for this place. This is not just for me. This is for my family,” Balla says on the video. MINNEAPOLIS COP WHO KNELT ON HANDCUFFED BLACK MAN GEORGE FLOYD CHARGED WITH 3RD DEGREE MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER On a GoFundMe for rebuilding his bar, he confirmed that it was destroyed Thursday night. “The building and my business was completely burned down last night,” he said. “I am devastated but I know something positive will come out of all this. Stay blessed everyone!” In an update, he said: “To find out that the countless hours, hard work, late nights away from my kids, and family had all been for nothing was soul-shattering. It is not the material things, more so the time that cannot be reclaimed.” Created just a day ago, KB Balla’s fundraiser has already surpassed its goal of $100,000. As of Friday evening, the total was over $300,000 and nearly 12,000 people had donated. Twyana Balla, KB’s wife, posted footage of the scene on Facebook, and condemned the idea that the riots were somehow achieving justice for George Floyd, who died earlier this week after a police encounter caught on video that went viral and prompted protests in multiple U.S. cities. “As we were standing in the front of the restaurant, people were in the back trying to steal the safe!” she said in a Facebook post from Thursday. “This just happened an hour ago in broad daylight! It’s so easy to say what people should and shouldn’t do until it’s affects you! Yes people are mad and upset, I get that and I understand the protest, I’m hearing people say F*** the business they have insurance WELL WE DONT AND THIS IS ALL OUT OF POCKET!!!” she added. MINNEAPOLIS RESTAURANT PRAISED FOR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTERS: ‘LET MY BUILDING BURN’ “Let someone come run in your home and loot for the cause then and let’s see you be ok with it! This is your neighborhood and if you have children you couldn’t even walk them down the street because everything is burning or destroyed. You wouldn’t understand unless you was in this position! Justice for George Floyd but not this kind of justice.” In an update she apparently added later, Twyana Balla confirmed that the “whole building” had been “demolished.” She and KB did immediately responded to Fox News’ request for comment. TRUMP ON MINNEAPOLIS UNREST: ‘LOOTERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DROWN OUT VOICES OF SO MANY PEACEFUL PROTESTERS’ On his GoFundMe page, Balla described hearing the news that his business was demolished. “I was doing my shift at the fire station this morning when I got the call that the entire building had been burnt down last night,” he said. “My heart was heavy, and I had to leave work because the emotional toll was too substantial. Right now is a tough time for my family and I, but also the community and the whole state. I know it will take some time, but we will rebuild and come back even stronger than ever. To the countless people who donated on the Go Fund Me page, sent emails of encouragement, and those praying for us and supporting us around the world, THANK YOU!” He told followers that “strangers” showed up with cleaning supplies to help him and his family.

THIS IS WHAT GIVES ME HOPE! I want to thank and shed light on the real true Minnesotans who helped many of us small business owners clean up yesterday.” On Friday, authorities arrested Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer who pinned Floyd to the ground by placing his knee on Floyd’s neck. Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case, which sparked protests across the United States and fires and looting in Minneapolis. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated Thursday as demonstrators torched a Minneapolis police station that officers had abandoned. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted.

MINNEAPOLIS COP WHO KNELT ON GEORGE FLOYD ARRESTED “It’s time to rebuild our community and that starts with safety in our streets,” Walz said. “Thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their grief and frustration in a peaceful manner. But the unlawful and dangerous actions of others, under the cover of darkness, has caused irreversible pain and damage to our community. “This behavior has compromised the safety of bystanders, businesses, lawful demonstrators, and first responders. Now, we come together to restore the peace,” he added. Some nearby suburban counties also issued their own curfew orders. The emergency orders follow three nights of destructive protests in the wake of Floyd’s death while in police custody Monday. A viral video showing a white police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes after he was stopped on a suspected forgery charge has prompted outrage and demonstrations in Minneapolis and other cities. Floyd repeatedly stated he couldn’t breathe while onlookers begged the officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, to stop. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the incident were fired. Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with 3rd-degree murder and manslaughter. Walz activated the National Guard on Thursday in an effort to restore calm amid escalating civil unrest. Protesters gathered later that evening and set ablaze a Minneapolis police station, prompting officers inside to evacuate. Soldiers secured the station later that evening, along with the surrounding area. Businesses across the Twin Cities region boarded up in an effort to prevent vandalism and looting. Looters were spotted at a Target store Wednesday trying to break into cash registers. The retail giant, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, announced it will temporarily close two dozens stores in the region. Minneapolis officials have shut down much of the city’s light-rail and bus systems through Sunday to prevent further damage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has taken heat for his response to the unrest. On Thursday, he suggested that rioters could be shot, tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet was later flagged by Twitter for “glorifying violence.” He sought to clarify what he meant Friday, saying “the looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters.”",0.0

1620612290,2020-05-29 20:58:12,Protesters mostly disperse from downtown after police fire tear gas,https://wpta21.com/2020/05/29/fort-wayne-police-fire-tear-gas-as-protesters-spill-into-the-streets/,en,False,,127044,indianasnewscenter.com,http://indianasnewscenter.com/,"FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA21) - What started off as a peaceful protest at the Allen County Courthouse green Friday evening turned into something drastically different. The downtown Fort Wayne protest organized to demand justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis, started off with people chanting ""I can't breathe"" at 5 p.m. As the evening went on, protesters spilled into the streets and completely stopped traffic on Clinton Street. ABC21 Camera crews saw protesters getting on top of a semi truck. People then began sitting in the road at Clinton and Main Street. That's when Fort Wayne Police responded. The FWPD formed a line of officers in riot gear telling people to get out of street. Our cameras captured police spraying tear gas into the crowd. When protesters approached the police riot line, our cameras also captured officers spraying pepper spray at them. Other ABC21 photographers showed people smashing windows of businesses nearby. Fort Wayne Police Public Information Officer Sofia Rosales-Scatena asked the public to not come to downtown Fort Wayne and to stay home. Just after 9:30 p.m. Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry issued this statement: Our country and community are hurting as a result of the passing of George Floyd. It's a terrible tragedy for our society. Mr. Floyd's death did not need to happen, and we pray tonight for his family and the many others who've faced injustices. The City of Fort Wayne respects the rights of individuals to participate in peaceful demonstrations. Tonight's demonstration in downtown Fort Wayne began peacefully. As the demonstration moved along, it began to get more aggressive and the safety of the public was being put at risk. The Fort Wayne Police Department ultimately had to respond in a manner to protect the public's safety. It's vital that we come together united as a city that cares about one another and supports each other. That's what we've been committed to in an effort to make Fort Wayne the best city possible. Now more than ever we need to respectfully and peacefully engage in productive dialogue and understanding as we grieve together, knowing that we can have better days ahead of us. Mayor Tom Henry It appears police were able to disperse much of the crowd around 10 p.m. but police remain in the street. Just before midnight, protesters and police moved down to E. Berry Street and Calhoun Street. Authorities using a loud speaker told people to go home or be arrested. ABC21 crews witnessed several people taken into custody. Veo Ride, a bicycle and e-scooter ride share company that services Fort Wayne, said they are shutting down until Saturday morning at 8 a.m. due to the protests. Veo Ride sent a push alert to Fort Wayne app users Friday, May 29, as protesters clashed with police. ABC21 Journalists say tear gas lingered in the air into the early morning hours. Crews were boarding up shattered windows at several businesses while the cleanup had yet to start at others.    Among the damaged downtown businesses: The Hilton hotel, Forteeza Coffee, Jimmy John's sandwich shop, Anthony Wayne Credit Adjustors, Practice Protection Inc. and DNB Commercial Real Estate.

1620622880,2020-05-29 13:00:00,Protesters torch Minneapolis police station in violent night,https://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2020/05/news-ap-protesters-torch-minneapolis-police-station-in-violent-night,en,True,,660448,Ball State Daily News,http://www.bsudailynews.com/,"By TIM SULLIVAN and AMY FORLITI MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Thick smoke hovered over Minneapolis on Friday, hours after cheering protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned as a third night of violent protests flared over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Police evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, late Thursday to protect employees, a spokesman said. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, prompting a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” MORE STORIES: He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. By Thursday night, hundreds of demonstrators returned to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence. Demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Local leaders repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Full Coverage: Minneapolis Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard on Thursday, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Among the casualties of the protests: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing extended to Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Other states are catching up. Every state that catches up to us are fewer dollars for us to rebuild. Think about it. Every dollar that goes into our economy, every dollar of job trading, every dollar that goes to healthcare, every dollar that helps a child that needs our help, every dollar that helps the disadvantage, the unfortunate, every dollar that we can use to make ourselves stronger. We should want. When the federal government is already giving out those dollars, Let's take the share that we need. That's based on how many people go online or call this number and go ahead and fill out the census. We're doing some of the best we've ever done on the census, but that is not enough. We've got a chance to do even better, all right. And it's not just your duty as an American to fill out the census. It's your duty to vote. We have our primary election coming up in June. There is a safe way for you to do it. Go online, request your absentee ballot with an update on that 190,000 requests have already gone out. Even just a week gets a week today and we've had 190,000 requests, well over 200,000 requests with counties including Jefferson and Kitten that started the process earlier on. So let's make sure that we, well, that's 200,000 total. They think at least 35,000 of applied through the process in those areas. So bleak peas, please be patient with the clerks. They're working to get the balance out. But go online, make sure you vote. It's incredibly important. Let's make sure that we get it done. All right, Um, and waking up today, uh, through a difficult night in Louisville last night, wanted to make sure I started with a few remarks. And I think they're poignant after Reverend Aitken's from From Last Night. First, Louisville was my home for more than 15 years before I won this office and move my family to Frankfurt. It is a special place. It's a special place to may I know they've said in politics before that you shouldn't say that you lived in Louisville or he loved it. But you know what I did, and I do. But it's also a city where we can see the impacts and the vestiges of slavery, of segregation of Jim Crow. And it's almost that it occurs on a specific street. And I believe what we have seen in response to a very concerning shooting of an e m t. A young woman who who worked to save lives of others here in Kentucky. It's hard, but in a broader context, and we've talked about it here. Number of nights is this pandemic we're facing has laid bare the inequalities that still exists in our society and that many times air fatal as you've seen from our charts, are black or African. American. Population is about 8% of our statewide population, but it's about 19% of our deaths. We've allowed that inequality to exist for hundreds of years, with many times that we could have changed it or many times that we could have made more strides, and we see it specifically happening in Louisville. I know the family of Rianna Taylor is working hard to ensure that we don't continue to see this type of inequality on this type of violence in so many different ways that can occur. So last night's event started with a very peaceful protest, one where people wanted to be heard but didn't want to cause harm one where people were seeking justice. And I'm gonna say, having housing a number of protests, that it was also one of the safest one, the most compliant with CDC guidelines that these were people truly looking out for human life. And then I believe some other folks, very light more than three hours in came in and also ultimately instigated actions that have been hard Teoh to see. But this morning, Brianna's Taylor's Briana Taylor's mom reached out through family representatives, and, uh, this morning on CNN, I read a statement from her mom because I believe in this instance her mom's voice, which should be heard in this situation regardless. But it's a really important voice for us, and I'm gonna read it in full, and you're gonna be able to tell from it. It's not edited. It's what she wanted to say. It's important Briana devoted her life to saving other lives to helping others to making people smile and bringing people together. The last thing she'd want to see right now is more violence. Changes are being made, but it's not enough. We will not stop until there's truth, justice and accountability. Brianna's legacy will not be for gotten, and it's because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We're saying her name or each day. Thank you. Please keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability. But let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen. But safely, statements from her mom still very wrong, still very emotional. But even in the place that that her mom and her family are in, it's very important to them into the legacy of this young woman that that demonstrations air safe. There is not violence, but that what they're saying is absolutely heard. I would encourage Kentucky ends to hear Brianna's mom's message as we come out of this pandemic. One thing I've talked about us, let's make sure we fight and we finally achieve equal access inequality and health care because we have not just seen Brianna's death, but we have seen disproportionate deaths of so many and each other. Individual has a name and a family to, and it shouldn't take it once in every 100 year pandemic for us to do something about it, it shouldn't take the raw pain and what we're seeing out there in society for us to do something about what absolutely, and obviously exists. We've talked each and every night about how absolutely everyone matters in this pandemic. Everybody's actions matter in this pandemic. How about we believe that everybody truly matters? How about we believe that every child born in this world deserves rial opportunity, and every family and individual deserves to be able to see a doctor when they're sick? And how about we do more than believe that you actually try to do something about it? So I know that tensions are high. I want people to know that they're being heard, and I know it's not fast enough, and I know it's not satisfied, but let's make sure that we're also protecting our fellow human being out there and that we're doing things safely, both in this virus and for each other. Let me finally say that. Well, I'm trying to provide the right words. I don't claim to understand the depths of pain and frustration that I know that so many people feel I can't. What I can commit to do is to listen and to do my best to tell you that and demean it that that I want to move this world in a better place. And that's my commitment to continue to do. All right. There's no easy transition from that to the other things we're gonna talk about tonight. But let me first say that our next one of these air next press conference will be on Monday. I'm going to go Monday through Thursday next week, and we're going to do them at 4 p.m. A change that's been requested by a number. Onda will hopefully ensure that we can still communicate with as many people who ultimately won a tune in and watch. Um, I'm gonna ask Eric Freelander to come up and given update on our senior care on. I'm gonna take a minute and then I'll come back and talk about our numbers the M C O contracts and our other news of tonight. Thanks. Good evening. The governor asked me to talk a little bit about long term care and what we've been doing and what I think is a very rapid ramp up in our testing capacity. As I've said to you all before, we took very early action. We limited in person visitation in our long term care and are not congregate care for settings. This is important is vital. This is the way that we know the virus can common to facilities. And we know that through some of our contact tracing that actually has happened. So we need to make sure that we don't and we needed to make sure that that was not gonna be a vector for us. We may changes in some of our reimbursement, and we asked a group of experts to come and help us with guidance for long term care. And that group has been meeting a couple of days a week. They have been very deck dedicated, and these air medical directors thes are medical ethicists, thes air folks from the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky. These air people with long term care ombudsman and AARP. So it's a It's a good group of folks to examine and advised the Cabinet, and they have, and they've given us very good advice. And that advice has changed a couple of times, as we've learned, and we've learned new things this entire time, Uh, the governor said the other day, We have not been perfect. Obviously, you can see that in the numbers. But we've been very aggressive and we've acted very early, and in the early days we didn't have enough PPE and we didn't have enough testing. And today we do. It's a story of how we have ramped up and come together as an entire community groups that didn't necessarily trust each other. Hospitals, local health departments, long term care facilities. We would be on the phone and we'd work those relationships out. And now they're working together seamlessly. Our infection control group with public health. Our friends at Norton Healthcare and the local health departments have been responding quickly and aggressively when we've identified positive patients and facilities that need our help. We've done several emergency transfers from nursing facilities and assisted living facilities. We test personal care homes as well, and we believe a national study has shown that probably between 50 and 60,000 residents and staff need to be tested. So in just a short period of time, we have tested. As of today, about 15,000 residents and staff. We expect to test another 5 to 10,000 next week. We expect to have fully tested over 100 facilities by the end of next week. We are being very aggressive and very deliberate when we do these tests. As we saw with Nazareth A Clifton, you need to have a plan and you need to be prepared to take action. And we were, and we'll continue to do that. This is an aggressive disease in long term care. These are our most vulnerable citizens. These are our moms and dads. I think I talked to you last time about a woman, a trait, No powers. They actually ran a story about her, her the love of her life. Richard in Cecile Spaulding was in the Courier this week. It's a beautiful story and a tremendous loss for the community, so we'll continue to respond, will continue to learn, will continue to ramp up our response. We are testing over 1000 sometimes 2000 folks a day. And we'll do that until we get every last person tested. And that's our commitment, all right, So today's report is up on up up a fair amount in cases. Onda will have to wait to see the next couple of days to see whether it is just lab's getting caught up from the weekend or whether it is in and of itself significant and something will see moving forward. So today we're announcing 283 new positive cases of the Corona virus and why, I said, We've gotta wait to see what that means is still, if you look at the last four days, on average would be 158. And so if these are truly cases coming in over that period of time, that is still a decline in a significant decline from even two weeks ago. We'll have to see as we move into tomorrow and ultimately into next week. Previously, what we've seen is cases would increase on a Wednesday or a Thursday. What we've got to see here is that Monday that the labs weren't open, pushing that in tow into Friday. Eso I don't wanna um I don't want to suggest that it means something at this point. Either way, what we've got to do is wait and see, and we will respond accordingly. But we will respond, making sure that we're doing it with the knowledge of what it does or does not at this point mean after we do Our daily audits are our total number of cases from the very beginning to date. And remember, this includes a lot of people who have recovered is 9464 161 of those are probable. The others air lap confirmed. Of those 3231 people, we have reports of having recovered. It's out of a total number of tested of 227,944 about 6000 from yesterday. Again, that's a real positive increase in testing. We're seeing total number of her hospitalized. 2266 currently 499 ever in the I. C U 940 currently 81 on again that recovering number because it's my favorite number. 3231 new cases by County 62 in Jefferson, 41 Faye at a number of this is from the federal prison. Again, we have very little control on what happens there and and how the testing occurs. It is a significant amount of tests in County. I've done everything I can to push into pressure, um, and argue and to fight to get all the individuals out there, especially the employees tested. Warren County 31. Gallatin 18. Kenton, 17. Shelby 16. Boone 12. Logan 11 Campbell 10 7 and Allen and in Franklin Foreign Davis. And in Nelson three, and Graves, Henderson, Madison and Oldham. And to an Anderson, Bullet, Calloway, Grant Harden, Metcalfe and Simpson and one in a dare barren bath. Butler, Carroll, Casey, Christian, Clark, Crittenton, Fulton, Jessamine, Marshall, Pike, Woodward and three are unconfirmed. Today, we're also announcing that we've lost an additional nine Kentucky INS bringing our total death count. 418 um, one probable. The rest lab confirmed. These are nine families that again need us toe like her homes on our places of business are places of worship everywhere, up green for compassion. Right now, with all the events of the last couple days and compassion is something that we oughta have on full display, even when it's hard. Those we've lost tonight include a 74 year old man from Butler, a 51 year old man from Butler. A 90 year old woman from Butler. A 68 year old man from Gallatin. An 83 year old woman from Butler. A 70 year old woman from Butler. An 88 year old man from Butler. A 55 year old man from Oldham in a 64 year old man from Gallatin. Race and ethnic back breakdown of our cases, which we do each and every day of overall cases. 85% non Hispanic, 15% Hispanic on race, 74.15% white, 14.68% black or African American, 5.4% Asian, 5.53% multiracial and then on the deaths. That's about 97% non Hispanic, a 3% Hispanic on ethnicity and then on race, 78.46%. White, 17.82% black or African American, 1.86% Asian, 1.86% multiracial. And I got said earlier, It's not right. It's not right. Put up the long term care facility numbers. Eso a lot of what we see today, and I believe what we see in those numbers. But we need Teoh get more data on our numbers from today is our significant testing in our long term care facilities. If we test everybody, if we tested 15,000 that the number, then we're gonna find more positives. We're gonna find a lot more asymptomatic folks, but we still want to note to make sure it doesn't continue to spread. So today we have 77 additional residents, 27 additional staff that have tested positive and and we've been ableto delineate that they have been 15 additional resident deaths. So obviously those air looking back in time, it does take us some time while we get the reports. Then we do have to then go back and figure out if they are in long term care facilities. We know by now that the steps were taking are important that their critical based on the numbers that we that we see eso again. I don't want to jump to a conclusion about today's numbers. We got to admit that their higher, but we also have toe have toe know that any average that we've seen over the last four, even more days is on a decline and is lower. So let's wait. Let's see tomorrow. Let's look at where we go into next week and we could make a logical conclusion about what is or isn't uh, going on all right? A couple of additional announcements and was the healthcare announcement on? And it's one that while it's not directly related to Cove in, it's really important that people have the care that they need. Eso Kentucky's Medicaid program is administered by what we call em CEOs, managed care organizations. These are companies that come in and provide this health care through Medicaid to over a 1,000,000 right now, much more than a 1,000,000 Kentucky ends across the state. And without expanded Medicaid, which increased that number, I don't know where we'd be in fighting this virus. It's insured that more people have health care on while we have mawr that we need to do. I think it's been a godsend and thank goodness that we have it in place. Eso When I came into office, I think it was a week or even less before we solved the previous administration. Previous administration had scored and released awards of contracts to manage. He's their multibillion dollar contracts, some of the some of the largest contracts in the state. There was a concern based on the timing and based on the perception on, therefore, we put it out to bid again. This is a process where a group of people score it based on determined criteria. It is done outside of me. I wasn't part of it whatsoever. It is done objectively on it's done under the law. Under the law and these contracts, you can't give things to your favorites. You can't just pick out different groups for different reasons. It has to be done. Pursue it to this procurement law. And so today we announced five companies that will be awarded contracts to help with managed care. They are at now Humana. Let me skip to well care. The three of those have been providing Medicaid services as M CEOs the last several years, but there are two new M CEO providers, Molina Healthcare in UnitedHealthcare But what this also means, because this happens, is that there are several that did not score in these top five and therefore have not been awarded contracts. They include Anthem, who does our State Employee Health program and I think does a really good job. It also includes Passport, which is a company that has been, ah, really important part of Kentucky, and it's been Kentucky based, but under our procurement law, this this company passport, which I believe placed seventh of seven not just in this round but in the round before. You simply can't award a contract without violating the law, uh, to that company, and therefore it is not receiving one. I do want to say that it's provided great service. It's been a important community member in Kentucky. I do believe that some of our new companies here are gonna provide rial and special opportunity and and real and special opportunity, including to the Louisville community and the West End of Louisville. I saw a release right as I walked up that one of these companies is committed to creating almost 1100 jobs in West Louisville in a headquarters. I think that that has the opportunity to not only be, uh, of huge impact of being transformational, but also given the time that we have leading up to it. A lot of that workforce could come from that community with job training that could be done in that community by anchors in that community. So while this does appear to be at this moment a goodbye to a company that we have known for a long time, it may also be a chance to say hello to riel opportunities. Also including some different talks that I know Humana has been in to make some very significant investments to try to move all of our communities forward. Finally on. Then we'll get two questions because it's Friday and we should let people get off early. A quick announcement on driver's licenses And I don't think that I had There we go today. We're announcing an official order temporarily authorizing circuit court clerks to process expired driving credential renewals and replacement requests remotely, meaning you could get your driver's license renewed without going in. And to me, that sounds wonderful. Cardholders whose operator's license permit or identification card was lost or expired between March 1st and June 30th 2020 may apply with their local circuit clerk to receive a new card in the mail. The order allows remote application process to remain through July 31st 2020 Applicants requesting a card renewal must not request any testing. More information will come from AOC on their website soon. Until then, the March emergency order remains in effect. That extends the validity of cards by 90 days if the printed expiration date is March 18th 2020 or later S. So this means that people won't have to go in can get their driver's license renewed. This is something that the administrative Office of the courts, the circuit clerks and the governor's office all worked on. And hey, I hope in the future, unless there's some new tests that's required or some update that we can all get our driver's license renewed through the mail or other remote means we might have to get our pictures updated from time to time. But I think that there are things coming out of covert 19 that we realize that we don't have to do in person and in fact could be a lot easier to do remotely all right with that. Let's move to questions. I believe we have 1234 We have five of our reporters that air here today as well. A SAA University, Kentucky student that is observing Welcome Dylan. So we have Phil, Lawrence, Mike, Joe and Joe. And at some point we'll turn the camera around because you all have probably become very familiar with folks. So let's start with Joe one, and then we'll go to Joe, too. This is about protests in Louisville. It has there been an official request to activate the National Guard. At this point, there has not. But the Kentucky State Police will be offering some significant assistance tonight. And that's just to make sure that we can keep peace, that people can be hurt, who need to be hurt, but that we don't let a rogue element turn turn a protest calling for justice into something violent. Um, some parts of the country are reporting a spike in drug overdose cases during the pandemic. Are we experiencing that same spike in Kentucky? I believe that answers. Yes, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but any time that a virus like this makes it more difficult to connect. That's going toe. That's gonna be real hard on addiction. And this is a mean virus. It is mean, And it it attacks all of us in in in ways that make it harder to get through our connections with each other. How we deal with so much from now addiction to adversity, to depression. You, you pick. And so we're going to see that this virus didn't just have direct impacts. But it's it's harm. Is, is even more. It doesn't mean we didn't have to do what we had to do. We absolutely did. Had we not as we looked at the chart the other day, we would have been having almost three weeks ago, 16,000 cases a week. We've had 9000 cases overall, so but it's it's taking a heavy toll. Joe. All right, you with first. So So The question is that the auditor and the attorney general apparently put out a joint press release on on the data breach and the delay in its report. I hope that they got received information from us before they came to a conclusion and put that out. Otherwise it wouldn't necessarily be based on facts. But I stood here yesterday and said the reasons why on the reasons were that the workforce and education Cabinet did not believe under the law qualified as a breach. It was their belief, and that was their legal opinion. When we found out about it, we disagreed. And ultimately I made the call that we were going to air on the side of making sure that we provided direct and and full notice. I've already authorized Inspector General from a separate cabinet to come in and look at it because I'm not trying to score political points. I'm trying to do the right thing, and I think that's important. And as attorney general for the last four years, we looked at each and every data breach that came out. And this one, it doesn't appear that anybody a t least thus far has been financially harmed by. But that doesn't mean that we don't need to be transparent, that we don't need to disclose things and to do it timely. So I'm gonna be a governor that when I disagree on some things going on inside even our own government, I'm going to speak up about it. And sometimes it's going to be based on legitimate disagreement on what something means under the law and whether something qualifies as a as a data breach. I'm not happy about it. As you can see, I'm taking some major steps on it. Mike. The question is, what can I do as governor to address some of these racial inequities? And do I see it as a moment of of reckoning in the country? On that second question, given who I am and that I can't feel the years or the intergenerational pain caused by everything from slavery toe Jim Crow, it's hard for me to feel in tow to answer that second part of the question. But let me answer the first, um, about being governor, Um, I've taken steps that I hope put us on a better path, or at least small bricks, um, to help build a better world. They go from building What I what I believe is one of the most diverse cabinets that we've seen in Kentucky, where are top two appointed officials for the first time in our history, are African American to restoring voting rights which disproportionately were taken away from individuals who were African American to fighting against a rollback of Medicaid were sending that Medicaid waiver, which would have disproportionately impacted African Americans. But we need to do more going forward like there's any question about that. I want to make sure that I put steps in place and maybe a task force that it may be others. I'm trying to be thoughtful about it, especially with what's going on right now about how we address the inequity in health care, because I believe that while a lot is going on right now and a large part of it is in our justice system, this virus is laid bare inequalities in our system and on the healthcare side. I think that there ought to be a lot that I can and should do about it. But it doesn't mean that I know all the problems that are out there having not suffered from them myself. So my goal is both to continue toe. Listen, um and today I've reached out to two leaders in the African American community. Talk about this also to talk about the CEO awards, knowing that that they will have an impact and I'm gonna and I'm gonna continue to do that. It's just it's unacceptable that we still are where we are. And while I can't feel the frustration on the same level doesn't mean that I can't be committed tow listening and doing something about it, all right, Karen Czar is not with us today. Is Are we learning any new information about the inflammatory syndrome and Children? We have parents questions from parents as to how long they should monitor their Children. So Dr Stacks not here tonight. But the good news is we don't have any new Children that every child is now home from the hospital and I will tell you there was at least one there was in really bad shape, and that's a really positive sign that thus far it looks like it can take place at least eight weeks after, um, the child contracted cove it and they're they're theorizing that it may be the body's overreaction to the next time that they that they encounter this virus. But there's still a lot we don't know. Given how many kids we had in such a short period of time. I am very thankful that we haven't seen MAWR than we have seen thus far, but we're watching it very closely. Yeah, yes, the question is this. We move later into the summer, bigger festivals and events. What type of guidance will have on it? One step will happen when we reached the 50 or less with social distancing. So that will certainly allow weddings with 50 or less. They should be outdoors outdoor events where they can keep things to 50 or less. But we are also going to have to see plans and really look at when we get larger than that with an active, aggressive virus out there. 50 people. Right now, I hope everybody out there would look around. See that and think We got to make sure that if we have that many people together that we're doing it right and we're doing it safely, I'm gonna continue to have two goals and every decision we make every time somebody's upset. Something's not opening or opening up fast enough here. My goals number one. Reopening our economy and getting it back online and humming and not having to pause it. And number two getting our kids back in school. And so If there are things that you want to happen faster, I would ask that you consider this. Is it worth either of those things not happening or causing delay in them way? Don't want to keep something close that could be open. That's not something I want to do. Is Governor. I ran on more opportunity and having our kids get an even better education. Thanks to a wonderful educators, this has been hard. We're gonna continue to do the best we can moving forward, making the best public health and economic decisions we can. Lawrence question is, what type of assistance will state police be offering? We're offering. Resource is in terms of troopers, and I don't have that full number. I believe that it is over 50 but it may be north of that. So please, no, that's on approximation on some equipment. It's wanted to make sure that people are safe on. That's their goal. That's there on an entire gold. All right, Joe question is on the M CEOs and what was different in this round then, when the Bevin administration scored him, and was it justified with us pulling their award? First, we will have the documents up online today, almost all of the documents related to the award that gives everybody an opportunity right at the start, to look at him to make up your own mind. It's an attempt to be. I think it's transparent we've ever been, but attempt to just be transparent about the award. That'll be the score sheets. The one thing we won't have up all the beginning is everybody's proposal, which is just a ton of pages that were still trying to get scanned in. I think the fact that two different administrations and two different groups of scorers ultimately came to the same conclusions, though the five, the top five that were awarded some of those switch places within those five. I think it should give people confidence in it. And when I came into office and talked about this, I didn't accuse the Bevin administration of wrongdoing. I just talked about both the perception of how late it was awarded with some of his comments related to two passport. But one thing I was very careful about is to not suggest that the scoring was done and correctly, but given everything that was out there, we wanted people to have confidence in it. And if you look at at the decision, you know what it does have a major impact on what has been a strong Kentucky company. But I hope that people see now with the multiple rounds that that that it's truly based on objective criteria and scoring there now expect the companies that weren't weren't successful won't be happy about it. That's, I mean, these air pick contracts, and they have a big impact, and I expect they'll be vocal on, but certainly their right. But I think the right thing was done on. I think that looking back and seeing both should should give Kentucky is comfort. This is done objectively, Joe. There have been discussions on the Louisville Zoo with the Louisville health department that they believed were very positive. That information has been coming up to our division of public health and know they've had those conversations. I know that. I believe that they have even settled on a plan now that we believe would be safe. What I don't have is the date eso way will. I don't think we have announced a date, and that could be on a number of different ends. It could be that the zoo needs to do what they need to do to get ready. But what the zoo can do, and what Kentucky Kingdom can do and should be done right is that you can enforce the number of people that get in. Obviously, it's it's outside, too, and you can also enforce the size of any individual group. And you got a significant number of employees that air there to continue toe monitor that like my thoughts on the White House severing ties with the World Health Organization. I'll admit we've been pretty busy today on I hadn't seen that news. I could understand if if we believe that they're failures in the World Health Organization. But my understanding is that they're conducting significant and serious research and everything from this inflammatory disease that is impacting kids toe other research that can come from all different countries to give us a better idea of this disease. I hope that that research can continue. I hope that if we are a za country severing those ties that we can somehow continue to support that research. Right now, we need more knowledge, not less, not knowing when a I'm when a vaccine is going to come that we hope it comes soon. And let me since I'm saying this let me credit the White House because you should do that when they're doing something right with how much pressure and mo mentum that they have put behind a vaccine. And that's not just recently, I saw some criticism of how long it took the president to appoint someone who was gonna be his his vaccine guy. They've been pushing, and they've been talking to us about how hard they've been pushing for a long time. And that's, I think, one of most important actions they've taken. If it works out in a time period, that's faster than we've ever seen. Then then, you know, that's that's a real credit. But I do worry potentially about the impact that this could have on research. Now it may be that they've already addressed it. I certainly hope that they will fill. Yeah, it is a tough it's a tough time, especially with rent, and that's both on tenants and on landlords. I mean, we hear a lot of stories about landlords were trying to kick people out in the middle of an epidemic, and that's a small percentage. But it's one that you got to address, and it's one that rightfully gets attention. But you got a lot of really good landlords out there, too, that are looking at What do we do? I mean, what do we do about rents that were ultimately owed? And and that's gonna be, ah, hard issue coming out of it. You know, one thing that we know is the Team Kentucky fund, and we can have an update on this on Monday is helping people right now with their rent. It's helping people right now with their utilities were making sure through the Community Action Council of Kentucky and others that those dollars air going out to help people. And that's one way that we can help, at least in a small way. Now, folks ought to know that that as we come out of this and we're gonna need to get everybody back to work, we're gonna need a long term solution for that which is going to take, you know, agreement and compromise between both landlords and tenants. We talk about getting through it together. That's included in that situation. To Lawrence, the question is on the passport headquarters. My understanding from reading different releases and from different stories both recently and before, is that one of the successful awardees has committed to finishing that project and committing on committed to creating a headquarters that they help could be there. They would have to acquire the property. I mean, there are some some issues there, but committing Teoh building headquarters in the West End, that could employ up to 1100 people. And I'd be really significant 1100 new jobs created at a time when we're restarting our economy in an area. Um, that that hasn't seen enough new jobs with what we hope is the company that will be incredibly stable could be a really amazing opportunity. I believe I actually do believe that while this is hard saying goodbye toe passport, that that we're going to see investments from multiple of the award winners, that could be really transformational. I believe that well, we've seen a lot of hard news the last two days that we could potentially see coming out of this. The types of investments that we haven't seen in decades now Has it been promised before? That would have been discussed before, But I see a real possibility, and I know that there are a lot of leaders in the community that are excited about those possibilities. Other one more quick round. The company that put out the press release was Molina, but I don't believe that they are the only company that is planning significant investment. And it makes sense, right, especially from a Louisville based or one that's gonna be Louisville based and obviously these air based all around when you're looking at improving health outcomes, improving job opportunities is an important part of that. And if you have an opportunity and creating the infrastructure off, especially a new system or or in moving in around, creating more opportunities for good jobs and healthy lifestyles is something that I believe is a good business model for it, too. The question is, with the Kentucky State Police being available toe assist Ellen PD tonight. Do we see it continuing? If L NPD needs that help, if if the city of Louisville for keeping things peaceful, needs help, they'll be there and we see different things popping up. We hear different rumors of different outside groups coming in. I want people to be hurt, and I want them to be able to be heard without violence and without people hijacking what is a peaceful but that can and potentially should be a very demonstrative my protest or rally. Or you pick from becoming from becoming something that's not productive here, you know, way need to figure out one of these challenges is, is classifying right? Some some types of businesses or or community groups that don't neatly fall into a forward facing business or a retail or the other eso. We will need to have that direct conversation with them once we hit the 50 or less which Israel, which is, which is certainly in June, any time that people can have the social distancing, um, and serve a group that is that or smaller, they're gonna be able to do it. That's gonna make things a lot easier in that instance, but the Americana centers incredibly important facility. They certainly could start serving 10 or less with social distancing now, but let us communicate with them so we understand exactly where they would fall. But it's admittedly a challenge of reopening and that you have a couple different classifications that hit about 98% of businesses, which could be open now. But then you still have a few that are very different, but very important. So what will jump on that mike work? Or so there is apparently a another protest tomorrow at the Capitol by an individual who was at last Sunday's events. That individual do you have that? I went on Facebook and apparently said, uh, hanging in governor and effigy or apparently storming the the mansion was not a big deal. And I think it's words where as long as they didn't pull me out and hang me, actually that things were fine. This is not okay. These are the types of extremist groups that some of our elected officials have been catering to that have been listening to. This is somebody that who's sport has actually been sought by different people out there Now, I don't know that they would have expected this. This is much further, but our politics cannot be driven by groups that want to inspire hate or fear or stand in front of groups that they know are likely to do the wrong things and encourage them or whipped them up. This is the absolute wrong thing. But despite their attempts to create fear or terror, I'm not gonna be afraid. And I believe that one of 3% or stood outside my office not too far from my window today, a new probably what he was trying to do to be close to where, uh, the family lives to be close to where I work. The fact that we have somehow emboldened those that would do these things is wrong, and it ought to stop now. But you know, to them, I'm not gonna stop doing the right things and protecting people and anybody online who's trying to talk in any given time about where my kids are. You can not deflect from the attempts to create terror and hate. And I would hope that you thought your kids were off limits to All right, Phil. So we start with our are you sports plan in trying not to spread the contacts outside of the community that that that the kids Aaron again them or that we do that, the more that the virus spreads And so we're trying to start with the youth sports plan that doesn't take contacts from other states or from broad other communities. And and so in trying to do this safely, I know a lot of people are talking about travel baseball. What I would really encourage is for your travel ball teams if you can. Or you will. Are you willing to sign up for a little lake or a or Babe Ruth or do it within your city? You know, a lot of cities or communities or communities there close have a lot of these teams, and I've been in a lot of those games. I believe that people can do this, they can do it safely and that they could still have a lot of games. It might not look the same as it did before, but remember, if we have these tournaments right now, where you bring in 100 teams or 40 teams from all over the state are all over the country. That's a lot when we're trying to reopen our economy when this viruses out there. So again, my question to those that would wanna have one of those big tournaments is is it worth risking the reopening of our economy and getting people back to work. And is it worth risking getting our kids back to school? So what we've tried to do is find a reasonable way for youth sports to start without creating an unmanageable risk. All right, Lawrence, last one, that's Ah, the question is, what's my message to the people of Louisville? As we see more potential protests toe tonight, I can't pretend understand, um, the level of frustration, fatigue that people must feel with hundreds of years of inequality, things being we're difficult than they should. Maybe being looked at, judged and treated differently of seeing a virus right now that is taking more lives because of it, because action wasn't taken soon enough to see videos off someone putting their knee on someone else's throat. Well, they cry out for help, and nobody does anything about it. I can't pretend to know how that feels, but I can't commit to listen being the governor of the Commonwealth of this state, and I can commit to do everything that I can in our system toe help, I hope you understand. And everybody understands that that they were laying bare the problems in our society, and we need to recognize them. But we also have to commit to do something about them and understand that commitments have been made before and haven't been followed through. But now I want to be the time and this ought to be the place. And I hope that provides some level of encouragement, though it's no, it's wrong, it's and it's hard right now. But I hope most of all that it tells people that I'm and I hope everybody else is listening on hearing and that and that we don't and and the violence if necessary to make to make that point. I also believe that there are groups out there, um that want to create a violent situation to cause harm to the community, that is pro testing and those trying to keep the peace that understand that there are forces out there that hope that they can create a clash because that's what they want. Then they're gonna get out of the way because they won't harm toe to both. It's not given that it's not, but groups like these three percenters like these extremists, turn people against each other and create violence is Let's not let that it happened. I limit the arts, I don't have the right answer and I probably don't have the right words. But I'm the governor of this state when this is happening. I've been a Louisville resident up until I moved my family for 15 years. It tears at the fabric of who I am to see this happening. But I hope that we can respond the right way. I hope that we can be better, and I really hope that we can listen and then we can do something about it. All right, so I hope we have a safe weekend. I hope we have weekend all around the state where we do the right things to defeat Cove in 19. We will see you on Monday at 4 p.m. And of all these things, we're gonna get through this together. Let's make sure that everybody believes that we're together and that requires that people be hurt and that we admit that when we have real problems in society and we haven't done something about them for far too long that people could be rightfully frustrated and tired. And now it's got to be the time when we start to fix it. Thank you all very much SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS Get local stories sent straight to your inbox as news breaks. Submit Privacy Notice",0.0

1620633486,2020-05-29 12:00:30,7 shot at Louisville protest over fatal police shooting,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/7-shot-louisville-protest-over-fatal-police-shooting,en,True,,175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as hundreds of protesters converged on City Hall demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot in March by police who broke down her door. Louisville Metro Police said early Friday that at least one person was in critical condition. ""No officers discharged their service weapons,"" and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. ""I feel the community's frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight's violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter. He said two of the wounded underwent surgery and five were in good condition. Thursday night's demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. It also came hours after the release of a 911 call Taylor's boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old emergency medical technician was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. ""I don't know what is happening,"" Walker told a dispatcher during the two-minute call. ""Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend."" Walker can be heard on the call crying and calling Taylor's name. He says Taylor is on the ground and that she was shot in the stomach. Federal and state officials are reviewing the police department's internal investigation, the police chief announced his retirement and the mayor changed policies on no-knock search warrants. The officers have been placed on leave while the shooting is investigated, but have not been disciplined. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city's downtown streets, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. ""Understandably, emotions are high,"" Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability. ""As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,"" the mayor wrote. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family. ""Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" a woman says in the video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting."" Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words ""You can't kill us all."" A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. WFPL reporter Ryan Van Velzer posted on Twitter that he saw two black men shot in front of him. He said he did not see where the bullets came from, but said police quickly found the men on the ground and started delivering first aid. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Whose streets? Our streets."" ",0.0
1620633476,2020-05-29 13:00:57,Police across US speak out against Minneapolis custody death,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/police-across-us-speak-out-against-minneapolis-custody-death,en,True,,175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"By STEFANIE DAZIO Associated Press LOS ANGELES (AP) — Murder. Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. ""There is no need to see more video,"" Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. ""There no need to wait to see how 'it plays out'. There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this ... turn it in."" The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city's police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. ""I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,"" Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. ""I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I'm Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family."" Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. ""Not going to hide behind 'not being there,'"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I'd be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all."" But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a ""cheerleader"" for a ""handful"" of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. ""Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,"" she said. ""It's nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault."" Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't ""particularly moved"" by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. ""We've got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd's neck,"" she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: ""I can't breathe."" It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. ""We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE."" Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD's shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are ""not delivering it on a consistent basis."" ""When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,"" he said. ""We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces."" ",0.0
1620633473,2020-05-29 14:00:16,Hong Kong on borrowed time as China pushes for more control,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/hong-kong-borrowed-time-china-pushes-more-control,en,True,,175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"By ELAINE KURTENBACH Associated Press BANGKOK (AP) — Hong Kong has been living on borrowed time ever since the British made it a colony nearly 180 years ago, and all the more so after Beijing took control in 1997 and granted it autonomous status. China's passage of a national security law for the city is the latest sign that the 50-year ""one country, two systems"" arrangement that allowed Hong Kong to keep its own legal, financial and trade regimes is perishable. China's communist leaders have been preparing for decades to take full control of the glittering capitalist oasis, while building up their own trade and financial centers to take Hong Kong's place. For them, national security and patriotism trump the civil liberties that brought millions of Hong Kong residents into the streets last year, hoping to protect their own vision for their future — protests that would not be tolerated across the border. In the early 1980s, as China's own economy began to open up to trade and investment after decades of Cold War isolation and political upheaval, the contrast between the mainland and Hong Kong was evident on crossing the border into the bucolic rice paddies and fish ponds of Shenzhen. Several generations later, Shenzhen is a metropolis of skyscrapers, high-tech campuses and huge, modern ports that dwarf Hong Kong's own, at least in trading volume. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have transformed the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China's answer to Silicon Valley and then some. It also is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have turned Hong Kong into just one of the big cities of the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it. The region has been transformed into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China's answer to Silicon Valley and then some, and it is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. ""Hong Kong is a Chinese city,"" said Kenneth Courtis, an expert on Asian economies and chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings. Instead of Hong Kong transforming its neighbors in Guangdong province, he said, ""it's more likely that Hong Kong will be more and more absorbed into Guangdong."" The rise of industrial and financial centers like Shenzhen and Shanghai has sidelined Hong Kong in other respects. The city accounts for less than 3% of China's economic activity, down from a peak of 27% in 1993, the height of its role as go-between in China's ascent as an export powerhouse. China's promise to leave Hong Kong's own legal and economic systems intact for 50 years, until 2047, has helped the city of 7 million retain its attraction as a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties. The national security law endorsed in Beijing followed recent arrests of Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates. Critics say it will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity, and many in Hong Kong reacted with dismay. Many of the millions of Hong Kong citizens who turned out in protests that began a year ago either escaped from the mainland or have parents that left decades ago. Having fled communist rule, they are clinging to liberties forbidden in mainland China, where public dissent is treated as subversive and punishable by long prison terms. ""The most frightening thing is that you will never be able to know exactly what would cross the bottom line for the Chinese Communist Party, or even where that bottom line is. No one knows,"" said Philip Chan, who was walking in downtown Hong Kong's Central district under the watchful eyes of masses of police in riot gear, a common sight nowadays. Hong Kong's government has insisted that the new security law will only affect a small minority of people, saying that life will continue as normal for most. The city's tycoons planted the seeds both for its success and its eventual undoing when they invested billions in Guangdong, across the border, taking advantage of special incentives and cheap labor, and eventually helping turn China into the world's factory floor. For the most part, those ultra-wealthy elites have sought to keep the peace with Beijing in return for wielding enormous influence both in local politics and business. Billionaire Li Ka-shing, whose fortune has taken a hit over the past year as Hong Kong's economy stumbled, told local media that he viewed Beijing's moves as its ""sovereign right."" He and his peers have voiced support for the security legislation, saying they hope it will help ensure public order. Beijing's insistence on enacting the national security law, among other measures including now-tabled extradition legislation that sparked months of anti-government protests last year, prompted Washington to announce it no longer will treat Hong Kong as being autonomous from Beijing. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will push ahead with the threat to no longer treat Hong Kong as an autonomous free port or how big the impact of such a move would be. Hong Kong accounted for about 8% of China's exports to the U.S. and about 6% of its imports from the U.S. in 2018, but its overall role in trade has been eclipsed by big ports to the north. The city was the world's second-biggest port after Singapore in 2005 and now is the eighth-largest: Shanghai is by far the biggest and its throughput has doubled during that time while Hong Kong's has fallen. The city is utterly dependent on the mainland for much of its water, most of its food, and to a large extent, tourism and investment. Before the protests and later the coronavirus pandemic virtually wiped out tourism, the city was a thriving cosmopolitan destination. It's a shopping and dining mecca with a vibrant cultural scene, strong traditions of philanthropy and historic preservation, and mass media and educational institutions largely unfettered by Communist Party dogma and censorship. At the same time, tensions have been building as the gap between rich and poor has widened. Political sentiment has become polarized as Beijing gradually extended its influence by ensuring its supporters would hold the deciding votes over such decisions as who would be the city's top leader. ""These issues are very much central to the demonstrations,"" Courtis said. ""Beijing would be very smart to address some of these issues. Repression isn't the answer."" While many in Hong Kong grew frustrated with disruptions from the anti-government protests that turned violent at times, still more have shown with the votes they are able to cast that they favor more, not less democracy. Some gathered in pop-up demonstrations Friday, including dozens who were chanting in protest n the busy IFC shopping mall downtown. Jerome Lau, 70, said he feared the government would crack down on public gatherings and free speech. ""Until I take my last breath, I will come out and fight for freedom,"" he said.",0.0
1620643433,2020-05-29 20:20:30,Protest marches resume as several metro communities impose curfews,https://www.wthr.com/article/protest-marches-resume-several-metro-communities-impose-curfews,en,False,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"8 p.m. Curfew orders took effect at 8 p.m. in Minneapolis, St. Paul and several other metro area communities, as protests and memorials for George Floyd continued into a fourth night. Tensions were high again near the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct where a large crowd had gathered, one night after the precinct building was set on fire. KARE 11 photojournalist Ben Garvin shared video from the scene showing a visible cloud of smoke in the area once again, and reported that people had once again reached the building, with no visible officer presence nearby. 7 p.m. Hundreds have gathered peacefully near the scene of George Floyd's death at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis. One person in attendance described the gathering's location to KARE 11 as a “healing space.” The Minneapolis NAACP also posted to Twitter encouraging community members to spread the word about the upcoming curfews. ""We are organizing car rides starting ... to offer rides home to young protestors and to let them know that the curfew is in place,"" the NAACP tweeted. 6 p.m. A protest march moved onto I-35W in Minneapolis, with hundreds of people on the freeway at one point, stopping traffic and forcing drivers to detour onto other routes. MnDOT says I-35W was closed to traffic briefly at Stinson Boulevard. Marchers were later seen exiting the freeway at Washington Avenue. 5:55 p.m. The Minnesota National Guard announced in a series of tweets that it would ""continue supporting several missions"" on Friday night, including security along Lake Street in Minneapolis, as well as providing security for the Minneapolis Fire Department and around the State Capitol. ""As citizens in Minneapolis and St Paul observe a temporary curfew this evening, the (National Guard) will be out helping to restore order and provide safety in the community. Rest assured, we are standing watch,"" the National Guard tweeted. 5:15 p.m. A large crowd of people joined a march through the streets of Minneapolis on Friday evening. Many were chanting George Floyd's name and ""no justice, no peace"" as the group crossed over the Hennepin Avenue Bridge. 4:50 p.m. The St. Paul Fire Department said it responded to 295 calls for service over the past 24 hours as riots ensued throughout the Twin Cities. In a press release, SPFD said 169 were EMS calls, and 126 were fire calls, with 55 actual working fires. According to a tweet from the department, a majority of fires were in commercial buildings and responding officials ""endured rocks and bottles being thrown at them."" St. Paul fire added that the St. Paul Police Department provided them safety. The thread continued, ""We are grateful for the support of our public safety partners and the mutual aid support we have received. The department is coordinating with multiple agencies to insure the safety of all our residents and visitors."" The department said nearly 200 firefighters were deployed Thursday night, in addition to help for neighboring communities. 4:15 p.m. On Friday afternoon, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter issued city-wide curfews on Friday and Saturday nights in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. The curfew begins at 8 p.m. and extends to 6 a.m. on both nights. People will not be allowed to travel on any public streets or in public places in response to Thursday night's riots. The state's order exempts people going to work, or returning home from work, as well as first responders, people seeking emergency care, people fleeing danger, the homeless, and journalists. The state order also allows mayors from other cities across the state to issue their own curfews. “It’s time to rebuild our community and that starts with safety in our streets,” Gov. Walz said in a statement. “Thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their grief and frustration in a peaceful manner. But the unlawful and dangerous actions of others, under the cover of darkness, has caused irreversible pain and damage to our community. This behavior has compromised the safety of bystanders, businesses, lawful demonstrators, and first responders. Now, we come together to restore the peace.” Later in the evening, the city of Roseville, city of Bloomington, Anoka County and Dakota County also issued similar curfews for their communities. 3 p.m. Peaceful protesters and mourners gathered outside Cup Foods near 38th Street and Chicago Avenue Friday morning and into the afternoon as emotions remained high following the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. The setting is where a memorial has been set for Floyd and the location where bystander video showed a Minneapolis police officer's knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading ""I can't breathe."" On Friday afternoon, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was identified in the criminal complaint as the officer with his knee on Floyd's neck. Freeman said Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but they're continuing to survey the evidence and that additional charges could still come. ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said. For some, the charges announced provide some sense of appeasement that justice is being served following Floyd's death. ""I think it's great that he's been charged,"" said one person outside of Cup Foods in Minneapolis. ""It's finally come to a realization to the people that finally justice has been served for the most craziest reasons, and what happened to George Floyd should never have happened."" Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. Friday after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Thursday night, fires continued to rage across both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Minneapolis Police were forced to evacuate the building housing the Third Precinct after a fire started around 10:30 p.m. Thursday night. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Mark Harrington said during a press conference that national guard troops were called in to help, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. Harrington said some people were arrested at the time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, but he didn't have exact numbers. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Early Friday morning, Frey held a press conference to address the burning of the Third Precinct Police Station in south Minneapolis. He reiterated his concern for the citizens of his city, saying rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone … brick and mortar is not as important as life.” A CNN news crew was arrested on live TV Friday morning while reporting on the continued unrest in Minneapolis. Officers in riot gear were seen pushing the reporter and his two crews members, as the reporter told them they would move. As one officer held the reporters arm, another informed him he was under arrest. The network reports that Gov. Tim Walz intervened, and quoted him as saying the arrests were ""totally unacceptable,"" and that he wanted the media to cover the developing situation here. More from KARE11",0.0

Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Chauvin, who was later fired, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was accused in court papers of ignoring another officer's concerns after Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe. Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines recommend 12 1/2 years for a conviction on the murder count and four years on the manslaughter charge. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death, according to the complaint. Floyd's family was seeking an independent autopsy. (Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I also recognize that the frustration and anger on display over the last few days isn’t new – it has been felt by communities of color for hundreds of years in a country that has far too often fallen short of providing liberty and justice for all. The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed. At a successful protest that occurred last night, hundreds of residents did just that, peacefully exercising their right to free speech. Unfortunately, after the organizers of that event ended the protest, a smaller group of individuals abandoned this message of positive change. I am saddened that so many people and businesses were injured in the violence that ensued. While the emotions that fueled this vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused are simply unacceptable and did nothing to further the cause of progress. Last night’s injuries included three law enforcement officers, as well as an individual who received serious injuries while kicking in glass and was saved when an IMPD officer applied a tourniquet and delivered life-saving care. I also want to recognize the actions of the Indianapolis Fire Department to contain multiple fires that were set, as well as our local media that provided necessary journalism under incredibly difficult circumstances. Our office and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department remain committed to ensuring the safety of peaceful protesters, and I would ask all who speak out in the days that follow to reject the tactics of those who would diminish a movement toward national action into unproductive destruction."" -Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett ""That's me.

Later, he was the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings for four seasons. The Super Bowl champion coach still feels a connection with Minneapolis, a city that helped launch his Hall of Fame career. As the city has become the center of the nation's attention this week following the death of George Floyd and the subsequent street protests, Dungy has looked on with conflicting emotions. “It's tough, my heart is just breaking right now,” Dungy said. “It's just hard to watch this. You see people who are frustrated, they're upset. Maybe not handling things in the best way, but they're very frustrated and they've seen this kind of cycle. We've got to do something to not only give them hope, but to restore love and respect to everybody and that's what I'm praying for.” Dungy, who coached the Colts from 2002 to 2008 and led the team to victory in Super Bowl XLI over the Chicago Bears before starting a new career as an analyst on NBC's “Football Night in America,” made his comments Friday on “Lunch Talk Live,” the television show hosted by his NBC colleague Mike Tirico. Dungy opened up about his thoughts on the protests, the role of athletes in times of crisis and relations between police and the black community. The former coach and player expressed sadness at some of the destruction of businesses in Minneapolis that has followed in the wake of the protests. He remembered driving through a hard-hit neighborhood in south Minneapolis “hundreds of times.” “There's a lot of minority community leaders, there's minority businesses, and to see that area just get taken down like this, it's very sad,” Dungy said. “So, how do you get your voice heard? How do you express your feelings? How do you come up with solutions and do it in a way that moves forward? That's the frustrating thing, but that's what we have to come up with. That's what people, I think, have to understand. My dad used to tell me all the time, 'What are you going to do to make it better?' “It does get frustrating, there's no question about it, but frustration can't be the driving emotion.” The protests in Minneapolis, which Friday spread to Fort Wayne, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, Houston and other cities across the country, came in the wake of Floyd's death during a confrontation with Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who was captured on video kneeling on Floyd's neck as Floyd said “I can't breathe.” Chauvin was arrested Friday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Dungy, a Tampa, Florida, resident, noted that he has friends on the police force in Tampa and his uncle was the assistant chief of police in Detroit in the 1960s and 1970s. He acknowledged the pain the protesters are feeling but urged them to come up with peaceful solutions that don't involve scapegoating and making a blanket statement about all police. “We have to have these voices heard, but we also have to do it in a respectful way,” he said. “I know we can't point a finger at every single policeman. “We have to look at individual cases, and we have to figure out a way that we can get some response and some satisfaction to the families of George Floyd and to the people who are saying, 'No one hears our voice.'” When it comes to the people who believe their voices are not being heard, Dungy believes athletes and coaches have a role to play in amplifying them and their perspectives. Doing so is a responsibility he learned early in his NFL career and he said he has been heartened to see players from the league speak out in the last several days as the protests have become national news. “I think we do have a responsibility,” Dungy said. “I know when I came to the Steelers (in 1977 as a player), Mr. (Art) Rooney, our owner, he talked about not just playing for the Steelers, but being part of the community. Being part of the community means stepping up at times when we need. Yes, it means community service, but sometimes it can be speaking up and saying, 'You know what people, we need to stay calm. We need to stay peaceful.' “Leadership – we need to listen to these voices. I saw a tweet from (Eagles tight end) Zach Ertz, I saw one from (Eagles quarterback) Carson Wentz, I've seen one from (Texans defensive lineman) J.J. Watt. Guys saying, 'Hey, we have a voice.' And that's awesome. You applaud that. That's what these guys, to me, were doing. ... We need to be a voice for those who may not have as strong a voice as we do. I think that's very appropriate for our sports figures.” dsinn@jg.net",0.0
1620666400,2020-05-30 01:00:00,Former officer charged with murder,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200530/former-officer-charged-with-murder,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – The white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd's neck was arrested Friday and charged with murder, as authorities imposed overnight curfews to try to stem violent protests over police killings of African Americans that have spread from Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large protests in New York, Houston and other cities were largely peaceful – even in Minneapolis, where thousands marched downtown as the city's 8 p.m. curfew ticked past and encircled a police precinct station. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, but some protesters sprayed graffiti on nearby buildings. Elsewhere in the city, forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. It wasn't clear if – or how – authorities would enforce the curfew, amid sharp questions about city and state leaders mishandling the crisis. The curfew came one night after protesters burned a police precinct station, and barriers were erected around at least two police precincts before nightfall. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. He was also accused of ignoring another officer at the scene who expressed concerns about the black man as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a small grocery store. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants all four officers involved to be arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into the other three officers continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Friday and today. The order said no one can be out in public except emergency responders and people seeking medical care, fleeing danger or those who are homeless. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today's decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” According to the criminal complaint, Chauvin allegedly disregarded the concerns of another officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side as he was being held down. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. Floyd's family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, the complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car, it said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car's passenger side, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back, and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin replied, “That's why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home has been picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd's death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers at the scene of Floyd's arrest on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside government offices chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin's arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated again Thursday night as demonstrators burned a Minneapolis police station soon after officers abandoned it. Protests also spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state had taken over the response to the violence. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world – and the world is watching.” On Friday morning, nearly every building in a shopping district a couple blocks from the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members carrying assault rifles were lined up at some intersections, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street.",0.0
1620666399,2020-05-30 01:10:04,Rioting may have been spurred by younger crowd,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20200530/rioting-may-have-been-spurred-by-younger-crowd,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"When Fort Wayne police deployed their canisters of tear gas Friday night, there was no warning. People stumbled off choking and gasping for breath. But the move only seemed to enrage the crowd that had grown from a traditionally peaceful Fort Wayne protest at 5 p.m. at the Allen County Courthouse to one with young people screaming close range at riot police and lobbing water bottles that spattered Clinton Street where they stood. At the beginning, there was no visible sign of any police presence. Sheila Curry Campbell, president of the local NAACP, and protest organizer Alisha Rauch said around 5 p.m. under sunny skies that they were pleased with the size of the crowd – at that time about 300 people – who had come out to spend their Friday evening standing with George Floyd, the Minneapolis man killed in broad daylight Monday by police officer Derek Chauvin. The seven-minute video of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck until he became unresponsive and was moved to a gurney set off violent protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere, violence that came to Fort Wayne and ended in bursts of vandalism downtown. The trouble started around 7 p.m., when protestors started to walk against traffic north on Clinton Street toward the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Bridge. Police intervened. They warned the crowds to get out of the road, according to Caleb Thomas, 25, of Fort Wayne. At that point, some protesters, younger than the original crowd, went down on their knees at the intersection of Clinton and Fourth streets, facing oncoming traffic and forcing drivers to veer around them or turn on Fourth Street, causing a bottleneck. Further up from that intersection, police deployed tear gas without warning and the crowd grew angrier, resulting in a scene rarely seen in Fort Wayne: a line of police in black riot gear facing off against the crowd yelling at them and getting in their faces. ""Black lives matter,"" the protesters hurled at police and ""No Justice No Peace."" Others got personal and used taunts. The police line stood and reinforcements came around 9 p.m. to form another human shield facing the courthouse. People started lobbing water bottles at police, hitting some of them and other bottles drenching Clinton Street where they stood. When it seemed the situation was getting out of control, an officer stood on top of an armored vehicle in the middle of Clinton and warned protesters on a loudspeaker that the protest was no longer a lawful assembly. Tear gas came without warning, scattering the crowd elsewhere, a block south on Clinton Street and a mob at South Calhoun Street and Wayne Street. One young man sat on top of a car blocking that intersection while horns honked endlessly and music blared. When asked his name, he replied ""unknown."" An earlier prediction by Jada Haynes, an Indiana State University student standing at the bottom of the bridge around 7:30 p.m., seemed to have come true. The criminology major took in the people blocking the intersection, the chants and the signs. ""It ain’t gonna get violent until the cops show up,"" Haynes said. Rauch said at the beginning of the protest that she didn’t believe police violence was as prevalent in Fort Wayne as in other cities and she had not personally experienced it. But George Knight, 43, at the bridge the same time as Haynes, disagreed. ""I’ve been stopped 10 times by the Gang Unit since I moved here two years ago,"" Knight said. As a member of Black Lives Matter, he was equipped with a personal body cam and showed The Journal Gazette the SIM card and press button to record. Christopher Martin of Fort Wayne came prepared to help other protesters. As he gave himself a dose of Benadryl to soften the effects of the tear gas around 10 p.m., he had water bottles, hand sanitizer and face masks for others. ""I’ve been around the block a few times,"" Martin said. Police opened fire on the crowd and this type of police action was ""the precise reason we came down here in the first place,"" Martin said. By 10 p.m., police had all downtown intersections blocked with police vehicles and large tow trucks. Glass shattered at the Jimmie John’s restaurant at Wayne and Calhoun streets as one protester smashed his skateboard through the window. At the corner of Wayne and Harrison, Jenica Collins stood. On Facebook, she had organized the protest for Saturday at 2 p.m. and the response was overwhelming. Many people said they were coming. It was something she’d never done before, she said. Curry Campbell had taken her by the hand earlier and the two of them were planning the usual Fort Wayne protest. Music, speeches, pastors and plenty of indignation. But Collins said she didn’t want ""this,"" indicating the rioting around downtown, and looked up the street in discouragement. The Saturday protest has most likely been canceled. jduffy@jg.net",0.0
1620666391,2020-05-30 01:00:00,Police deploy tear gas on downtown protest,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/police-fire/20200530/police-deploy-tear-gas-on-downtown-protest,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"A Friday evening demonstration near the Allen County Courthouse began peacefully but turned potentially unsafe after Fort Wayne police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The demonstration started at 5 p.m. and was initially scheduled to go until 8 p.m. But crowds were still gathered after 9:30 p.m., with some pledging to remain through the night if necessary to express their concerns about Monday's death of a black man Minneapolis police were restraining. Released video showed 46-year-old George Floyd on the ground with a police officer using his knee to apply pressure to his neck; Floyd was heard saying “I can't breathe.” His death and the video sparked outrage in communities beyond Minneapolis with appeals spreading through social media for people to demand justice in the case. Locally, between 7 and 8 p.m. crowds started to block Clinton Street walking north toward the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge. That's when Fort Wayne police arrived on the scene and used tear gas on the crowd. A demonstration was scheduled for 2 p.m. today outside the courthouse. But an organizer of that, Jenica Collins, said late Friday that she had been asked about canceling it. Caleb Thomas, 25, of Fort Wayne attended Friday's demonstration. He said police seemed to feel the crowd was disobeying orders to stay on the sidewalk and get out of traffic. When protesters began to walk back to the courthouse, he said police then formed a line to block them from Clinton Street at Berry Street. Protesters, enraged because of the tear gas, got into verbal arguments with the police in riot gear. Some who gathered for the demonstration were pouring milk over each other's faces to stop the stinging, burning sensation from the tear gas as others shouted at police. The crowd continued to swell in front of the police, and about 9 p.m. an officer in the armored vehicle parked in the middle of Clinton between Main Street and Berry got on a loudspeaker and told people that it was no longer a lawful assembly and they needed to disperse and would be arrested for criminal behavior. By 9:30 p.m. some protesters were also throwing water bottles at police, who deployed more tear gas and the crowd began to disperse. Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry issued a statement late Friday acknowledging the country and community were hurting as a result of Floyd's death, which some leaders and activists across the country have called murder. “Mr. Floyd's death did not need to happen, and we pray tonight for his family and the many others who've faced injustices,” Henry's statement said. “The city of Fort Wayne respects the rights of individuals to participate in peaceful demonstrations. Tonight's demonstration in downtown Fort Wayne began peacefully. As the demonstration moved along, it began to get more aggressive and the safety of the public was being put at risk,” the mayor said. “The Fort Wayne Police Department ultimately had to respond in a manner to protect the public's safety.” At one point, one protester could be heard pleading with a WPTA-TV ABC 21 reporter who was part of a live broadcast to remain at the scene through the night. The protester said he feared police would get more aggressive if the media was not there to document it. But the demonstration clearly got out of hand. Streets where crowds gathered were littered with broken glass, and windows of a few businesses including Jimmy Johns were broken. Tyler Weber sat feet from Fort Wayne police officers who had just fired tear gas into a crowd of protesters at Berry and Clinton streets. Someone was pouring water into his reddened eyes to soothe them. “Oh my god,” Weber, 23, told a reporter before another canister was fired nearby. Weber said he'd come from Wabash in solidarity with people of color. “People of color are disproportionally targeted (by police),” he said. Loud bangs could be heard before wafts of white smoke – the gas – dispersed protesters from the scene, and many scattered to nearby streets. At those other areas, protesters screamed at police as officers – some wearing gas masks – stood with their arms crossed. Sonny Murray, 31, was angry about the deaths of black men including George Floyd. “I'm willing to die here tonight,” he said. “I'm gonna do whatever I can to help.” Taylor Frey arrived at the courthouse Friday evening and immediately encountered tear gas at the Allen County Courthouse. “I've been a part of a couple (protests), but nothing like this,” he said, carrying a half gallon of milk he was using to quell the sting of the gas. During a Friday afternoon news briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Eric Holcomb was asked whether there were any concerns that demonstrations and protests in Indiana could get out of hand. “Injuring the innocent in a response to an injustice is counterproductive. And I'm looking and appealing to people to find it in the goodness of their heart to be part of the solution, and not part of the problem,” the governor said. “And it can be tough when you see injustice around you; I get it, and you can be very reflexive and very reactionary. But I would just ask folks to take a breath, and to be part of the solution.” Holcomb also said these are unprecedented times, but there have been “beautiful acts of kindness coming out of it. But, he added, on the fringes “there will be some bad actors, and there will be some professional protesters.” Holcomb said he “very much” respects the First Amendment and right to “assemble and to speak, and to be heard, and to voice your opinion, and we'll continue to be respectful on that front. But I ask you to do it peacefully, it will be heard. Simply increasing your volume does not increase the validity of your argument.” jduffy@jg.net mleblanc@jg.net Niki Kelly and Dave Gong contributed to this report.",0.0

The event comes amid continuing developments out of Minnesota in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in custody of Minneapolis police The rally against social injustice is scheduled to last until 2 pm. Those preparing to go have begun making signs–not just for Floyd, but others they believe were unjustly killed. Organizers are working with Evansville Police, who say they will be keeping an eye on the event as the would any larger gathering. Ebon Ellis, who has led the charge on setting up Saturday’s rally says, he’s just a regular person trying to make a stand–and he’s asking for more partners to stand with him: “I would love for people–pastors to come pray. We do have somebody who’s offered to pray. She’s just like me though. A normal person. I’d love community organizers to reach out to me, and ask me, ‘Do they want prayer?'” The latest demonstrations in Evansville will come in the wake of several across Kentucky reacting to police actions. In Madisonville Thursday evening, peaceful protesters carried signs calling for justice for George Floyd. While in Louisville that night, seven people were shot during a protest of local policing. Both event organizers and Evansville police say, they anticipate Saturday’s demonstration–and the city–to remain peaceful. Comments comments",0.0

Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. TWIN CITIES RIOTING CONTINUES AS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR CLAIMS GUARD, POLICE RESPONDING Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Adviser Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. ”When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak.” the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,” said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest.” — Brad Moss, Washington attorney specializing in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities. But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state. “The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement,” the spokesman said, Title 10 is the U.S. law that governs the armed forces, and would authorize active duty military to operate within the U.S. Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue. “False: off the record – title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with The Associated Press. The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP’s questions to the Defense Department. The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. The Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. “It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Floyd, a black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. On Friday, President Trump spoke with Floyd's family, saying he understood their pain. That call came several hours after his tweet about about rioters in Minneapolis sparked outrage, and drew a warning label from Twitter. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. The protesters have moved from the White House to another part of the city. Multiple reporters posted that they were inside the White House and that the Secret Service was not letting them leave the grounds during the lockdown. The Secret Service frequently locks down the White House for perceived security threats, such as packages or bags left nearby. But the building is rarely locked down for protests. And while protests are a daily occurrence outside the White House, they are often small – drawing a few dozen people, at most. While the largest protests have enveloped Minneapolis, prompting the deployment of 500 National Guardsmen, people have taken to the streets from New York to Chicago to the California coast. Seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville on Thursday night, dozens were arrested in New York City, officers fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters in Phoenix and a driver appeared to intentionally run over a protester in Denver. The Secret Service said that their ""personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration in Lafayette Park. In the interest of public safety we encourage all to remain peaceful.""

Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota National Guard Adjutant Gen. Jon Jensen announced the request at a news conference early Saturday, FOX 9 of Minneapolis reported. Guard personnel already deployed in addition to state and local police just haven’t been able to control the violence and unrest that the Minneapolis-St. Paul area has seen in recent days, Walz said. TWIN CITIES RIOTING CONTINUES AS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR CLAIMS GUARD, POLICE RESPONDING “This is the largest civilian deployment in Minnesota history that we have out there today and quite candidly right now, we do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence.” Minneapolis police said gunshots were fired at police officers near the city’s Fifth Precinct on Friday night, one night after rioters broke into and torched the Third Precinct, FOX 9 reported. Meanwhile, the Pentagon – at the request of President Trump – has placed U.S. military police on alert for a possible rapid deployment to Minnesota, The Associated Press reported. Soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been asked to be ready within four hours of a call, while those at Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been asked to be ready within 24 hours, sources told AP. AT TRUMP REQUEST, PENTAGON PUTS MILITARY POLICE ON ALERT TO GO TO MINNEAPOLIS Floyd’s death Monday – for which four Minneapolis police officers were fired Tuesday and one of them, Derek Gauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder Friday – has sparked protests and rioting across the U.S., from New York City and Washington, D.C., to Chicago; Columbus, Ohio, Louisville, Ky., and Dallas, to San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. “The arrest of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the brutal killing of George Floyd is a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,” Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said Friday, according to FOX 9. “We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested.” Meantime, all across the nation came reports of arson fires, looting and smashed windows and vehicles. From some cities came reports of gunfire against police officers. And all of it happened as the nation continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans. In Portland, Ore., a crowd smashed windows and sparked a fire inside the city’s Justice Center, FOX 12 of Oregon reported. In San Jose, police officers fired on an SUV that struck at least two people, according to the Mercury News. “The whole crowd started chasing the car but it got away,” Saul Duarte, a protester who recorded the incident on video, told the newspaper. “After that, everyone surrounded the two injured people and tried helping but the cops started tear-gassing us.” WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES In Oakland, Calif., police said several officers were injured by projectiles, FOX 2 of the Bay Area reported. Bystanders also reported being injured. “I got punched in the face and my cell phone was taken,” one motorist told FOX 2. In New York, rioters torched a police van and NYPD officers reported hundreds of arrests, The New York Post reported. In Washington, the White House was briefly placed on lockdown as crowds reached a boiling point, FOX 5 of DC reported. In Atlanta, a crowd stormed the entrance to CNN headquarters, at one point climbing onto the TV network’s logo outside the building. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued an impassioned plea for rioters to stop their violence and simply go home. “What I see happening in the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta,” Bottoms said, according to FOX 5 Atlanta. “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose.” “What I see happening in the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose.” — Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms In Chicago, demonstrators shut down streets in the Loop, many of them chanting, “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd was heard saying on a video that went viral, showing a police officer kneeling on his neck, FOX 32 reported. Early Saturday, Chicago police were deployed to the Trump International Hotel and Tower, where a crowd had gathered. Video posted on social media showed people lying on the ground after apparently being struck by objects. Hundreds of protesters filled the streets in Louisville, where they demonstrated for a second night not only against Floyd’s death but against the death of Breonna Tayler, an emergency room technician who was killed by a police officer in her home on March 13. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Police used tear gas against the crowd, FOX affiliate WDRB-TV reported. “This has been a very sad night for our city,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer told reporters just after 1 a.m. Saturday. “There needs to be ample recognition of the underlying inequity that causes so much of this frustration, but there is no excuse for the destruction of property we have seen this evening. This is not protest; it is violence.” “There is no excuse for the destruction of property we have seen this evening. This is not protest; it is violence.” — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer Although fired Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with Floyd’s death, the three other officers who were fired in connection with the case have not been charged with any crimes – and it remained unclear when the protests and rioting would end.

A crew from WAVE-TV was downtown in the Kentucky city Friday night, covering demonstrations over the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her own home in March. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m., as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. As WAVE-TV was on air, reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera: “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as pepper bullets. MINNESOTA REQUESTS MORE HELP AS RIOTS CONTINUE THERE — AND ACROSS US “I want to apologize,” Louisville police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told the Courier Journal. “It’s not something that should have occurred if she was singled out as a reporter.” Halladay said she couldn’t tell who the officer was at this time, but that police would review the video again and “if we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that.” The video shows Rust and the camera crew moving away as indignant in-studio anchors ask if they’re OK and what’s going on. Rust tells them they’re OK, and that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. “Well I’m sure if they would have just said, ‘Move,’ you would have done so,” an anchor is heard telling Rust. A clip of the WAVE-TV broadcast posted to Twitter amassed more than 8 million views in less than six hours, and was retweeted more than 50,000 times, including by other journalists and rapper Ice-T. Louisville’s protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Taylor’s death has captured national headlines alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Taylor and Floyd, whose death has touched off protests across the country this week, including in Minneapolis itself. The use of non-lethal force on the WAVE-TV crew happened the same day CNN employees were arrested live on air while covering protests in Minnesota. Two people were arrested at Friday night’s protest in Louisville, and no significant injuries were reported, Halladay said. That’s in contrast to Thursday night’s protests, where seven people were shot. Louisville police have said officers didn’t fire their service weapons. TWIN CITIES RIOTING CONTINUES AS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR CLAIMS GUARD, POLICE RESPONDING Mayor Greg Fischer criticized the destruction of property seen Friday night. “This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable. It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor’s memory,” Fischer said in a statement. “Just this morning, Breonna’s family called for peaceful and safe protest.” Fischer said most of the grievances associated with Taylor’s death have been addressed in a live-streamed press conference after 1 a.m. Fischer had announced Friday that the use of no-knock warrants by police were being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and other actions in response to Taylor’s death. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fischer and Halladay said police believed a “significant percentage” of protesters came from outside Louisville. “I don’t know anyone from our great city that wants to destroy it,” he said.",0.0

Taylor said 27 people were arrested overnight in connection to the protests. He said about 30 businesses were damaged and five IMPD cars were also damaged. He said three officers and three protesters were also injured overnight. INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said he is saddened after people and businesses were injured after protests broke out late Friday night and continued through early Saturday morning in the city. “Like so many in Indianapolis, I was horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd. I also recognize that the frustration and anger on display over the last few days isn’t new – it has been felt by communities of color for hundreds of years in a country that has far too often fallen short of providing liberty and justice for all,” Hogsett said in a statement to News 8 Saturday morning. “The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed. At a successful protest that occurred last night, hundreds of residents did just that, peacefully exercising their right to free speech.” Shattered glass and vandalism left behind mark the end of a long night of disruption downtown. The city is bracing for what could come during another protest planned for 4:30 p.m. Saturday at the Indiana War Memorial. The doors of a CVS store downtown on Ohio Street were broken into and the store was set on fire as protesters took to the streets of downtown Indianapolis standing in solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. The events happened after Hogsett said a successful protest ended and a “smaller group of individuals abandoned this message of positive change.” “While the emotions that fueled this vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused are simply unacceptable and did nothing to further the cause of progress,” Hogsett said. The mayor said three law enforcement officers were injured during the protests. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department report a Marion County Sheriff’s Office deputy was shot at. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire, according to IMPD. You can read the mayor’s statement in full below:",0.0

Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia's capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the country, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.,"" Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes.

Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed an officer slamming a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated.

One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. An LAPD spokesman told the Associated Press they were still tallying arrests. “I believe in our city.

Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets.

Officers fired pepper balls. Two fatal police shootings by Indianapolis police in early May reignited criticisms of the department and its use of force policies. Here is a quick rundown of the events, the community's reaction and how the city and department have responded. MAY 6 (6:15 P.M.) — REED SHOOTING Dreasjon Reed, 21, is fatally shot by an unidentified Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer in the area of West 62nd Street and Michigan Road following a police pursuit that streamed on Facebook Live. Investigators say they found a gun at the scene that appeared to match a gun seen in Reed's social media pictures. It had been fired at the scene, Chief Randal Taylor said. Police said Reed had been driving recklessly. MAY 6 (EVENING) — PROTESTS BEGIN More than 100 people gather at the scene of Reed's shooting in a peaceful protest. Many chant: ""No justice, no peace."" The protest lasts several hours. MAY 7 (AROUND 1:30 A.M.) — ROSE SHOOTING Just a few hours later, four unidentified IMPD officers fatally shoot 19-year-old McHale Rose. They had been responding to a burglary call at an apartment complex in the 2200 block of Woodglen Drive, Chief Taylor said, when a man started firing a rifle at them. All four officers returned fire, he said. The 911 call appeared to come from Rose's phone, Taylor said, which suggested he had planned to ambush the officers. MAY 7 — SECOND DAY OF PROTESTS BEGINS A protest that begins around noon at the City-County Building grows to include at least 300 people, including members of Reed's family, and leads to marches that disrupt traffic near the scene of Reed's shooting. MAY 8 — OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears, citing a conflict of interest in the investigation into the Reed shooting, petitions the court for a special prosecutor. That appointment had not been made as of May 28. Mayor Joe Hogsett also asks for federal law enforcement to monitor IMPD's investigations into the fatal shootings of Reed and Rose. MAY 12 — POLICE REFORM ANNOUNCEMENT Mayor Joe Hogsett and Chief Taylor unveil some plans and timelines for what they characterize as three police reforms. They pledged to roll out a body camera program by the summer. They also share plans to create a new use of force review board, which would include some civilian involvement, and a new use of force policy. Both changes require the approval of a three-person committee representing the chief's office and the police union. Some of those plans began nearly three years ago, following the fatal police shooting of Aaron Bailey. MAY 13 — DETECTIVE SUSPENSION Chief Taylor tells IndyStar about an unpaid suspension for the IMPD detective who joked about Reed needing a ""closed casket, homie"" after the police shooting. Taylor declines to name the detective or say how long the suspension will be. MAY 28 — REVIEW BOARD CRITICISM After Chief Taylor announces a plan to expand the number of civilians on the pending use of force review board, the African American Coalition of Indianapolis says the policy still falls short of what the group has sought for years. MAY 29 — PROTESTS TURN CHAOTIC Protesters clash with police downtown after a demonstration ignited by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turns violent late into the evening. IMPD officers fire tear gas and pepper ba to disperse crowds. Windows and glass doors are shattered, fires are set in trash cans and at least a few stores are looted.

Officers fired pepper balls. Protesters clashed with police in downtown Indianapolis Friday night in an hours-long demonstration that started peacefully but turned chaotic later in the evening. Here's what we know as of Saturday morning: How the protest began The protest started peacefully Friday afternoon at Monument Circle with just a couple of dozen people who gathered to decry the police-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Protesters were also there to remember 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed, who was shot and killed by Indianapolis police following a pursuit May 6. Event organizers worked hard to keep the protesters calm in the early hours of the demonstration. Those who threw water bottles at police officers midafternoon were asked to leave. How the protest turned tense It’s unclear what caused the protests to turn violent after dark. By midnight, the demonstrations didn’t appear to be organized in any way. Police continued to try to break up the knots of people in the streets and on the sidewalks. Indianapolis police shootings:A timeline of recent events How much damage was done Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department used multiple volleys of tear gas and pepper balls in attempt to disperse crowds of people, who lingered on city streets well past midnight. As police stood in riot gear, groups of protesters moved through clouds of gas chanting “I can’t breathe!” and “Black lives matter.” Shattered windows and glass doors were seen on many businesses. Graffiti on a broken window at Key Bank at Market Tower read, “I can’t use my bank account if I’m dead.” An IMPD patrol car was vandalized. Fires were set in trash cans. A CVS was torched and looted. Other stores, including a jewelry store and a cellphone store, were also looted. How many people were injured IndyStar has requested information from IMPD on injuries related to the protests. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement that three police officers were injured. Additionally, a person sustained serious injuries while kicking in glass and was helped by an IMPD officer, Hogsett said. Just before 12:30 a.m., a police spokesperson said shots had been fired at a Marion County Sheriff’s Department deputy at 1 American Square, near Illinois and Ohio streets. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire, IMPD said. The shooter was not in custody. How many people were arrested IndyStar also has requested information on arrests. How Mayor Hogsett responded Hogsett released a statement in response to the protests just before 6 a.m. Saturday. In it, he said he was ""horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd"" and recognized ""the frustration and anger on display over the last few days isn’t new."" ""The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed.

The shooting was unrelated to the protests downtown, according to police. Officers responded just after 9 p.m. and encountered a man who appeared to be firing at them, according to police. The man later fled in a vehicle, leading officers on a short pursuit. Police recovered a firearm on the scene. Officers set up a perimeter and arrested the suspect, according to police.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

1620929464,2020-05-30 09:02:49,George Floyd protest live updates: Car slams into San Jose protesters; more National Guard troops to deploy to Minneapolis,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/625596000/0/indystar/todaystopstories~George-Floyd-protest-live-updates-Car-slams-into-San-Jose-protesters-more-National-Guard-troops-to-deploy-to-Minneapolis/,en,False,,85390,blogs.indystar.com,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Police used tear gas, smoke grenades and nonlethal projectiles Saturday night in a coordinated effort to beak up groups gathering after the start of the Twin Cities' curfew, aimed at preventing another night of violent protests after days of unrest following the death of George Floyd. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Who is causing the violence? Extremists are hijacking peaceful protests, officials say Read this: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it. Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now. I just had to come down and see it,"" said Brian Ledin, 58, who lives in a nearby suburb but was born in the area. Smoke rose from an O’Reilly Auto Parts store and CenterPoint energy workers searched for broken gas lines. Report: Military police could be dispatched to Minnesota The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, the Associated Press reports, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. According to the AP report, soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called. Soldiers in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, booked Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection to Floyd's death. He was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. A criminal complaint that references body cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Read more.",0.0

Officers fired pepper balls. Protesters clashed with police in downtown Indianapolis Friday night in an hours-long demonstration that started peacefully but turned chaotic later in the evening. Here's what we know as of Saturday morning: How the protest began The protest started peacefully Friday afternoon at Monument Circle with just a couple of dozen people who gathered to decry the police-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Protesters were also there to remember 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed, who was shot and killed by Indianapolis police following a pursuit May 6. Event organizers worked hard to keep the protesters calm in the early hours of the demonstration. Those who threw water bottles at police officers midafternoon were asked to leave. How the protest turned tense It’s unclear what caused the protests to turn violent after dark. By midnight, the demonstrations didn’t appear to be organized in any way. Police continued to try to break up the knots of people in the streets and on the sidewalks. Indianapolis police shootings:A timeline of recent events How much damage was done Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department used multiple volleys of tear gas and pepper balls in attempt to disperse crowds of people, who lingered on city streets well past midnight. As police stood in riot gear, groups of protesters moved through clouds of gas chanting “I can’t breathe!” and “Black lives matter.” Shattered windows and glass doors were seen on many businesses. Graffiti on a broken window at Key Bank at Market Tower read, “I can’t use my bank account if I’m dead.” An IMPD patrol car was vandalized. Fires were set in trash cans. A CVS was torched and looted. Other stores, including a jewelry store and a cellphone store, were also looted. How many people were injured IndyStar has requested information from IMPD on injuries related to the protests. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement that three police officers were injured. Additionally, a person sustained serious injuries while kicking in glass and was helped by an IMPD officer, Hogsett said. Just before 12:30 a.m., a police spokesperson said shots had been fired at a Marion County Sheriff’s Department deputy at 1 American Square, near Illinois and Ohio streets. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire, IMPD said. The shooter was not in custody. How many people were arrested IndyStar also has requested information on arrests. How Mayor Hogsett responded Hogsett released a statement in response to the protests just before 6 a.m. Saturday. In it, he said he was ""horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd"" and recognized ""the frustration and anger on display over the last few days isn’t new."" ""The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed. At a successful protest that occurred last night, hundreds of residents did just that, peacefully exercising their right to free speech,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, after the organizers of that event ended the protest, a smaller group of individuals abandoned this message of positive change. I am saddened that so many people and businesses were injured in the violence that ensued. ""While the emotions that fueled this vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused are simply unacceptable and did nothing to further the cause of progress.""

(WANE) – Several hundred activists gathered in downtown Fort Wayne Friday afternoon to protest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Fort Wayne Police fired gas to disperse the crowd. Saturday morning during a press conference police reported that 29 people were arrested during the protests. Friday’s protest began around 5 p.m. and many held signs calling for justice, with other signs saying “Make Racists Afraid Again” and “Black Lives Matter.” The protest was peaceful, and mainly contained to the courthouse lawn and sidewalk along Clinton Street. By 6:30 p.m., protesters blocked traffic on Clinton Street and began marching toward Superior Street. The group reached the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge by 7 p.m. Around 8 p.m., police fired gas into the crowd. Protesters scattered, some falling to the ground. WANE 15’s Dirk Rowley and Chris Darby and a photojournalist were struck. There was no police presence for most of the protest until that point. At 9 p.m., Fort Wayne Police asked residents to avoid the downtown area until further notice. Protesters run after gas is fired into a crowd in downtown Fort Wayne on Friday, May 29, 2020.

Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry issued the following statement in response to the activity: “Our country and community are hurting as a result of the passing of George Floyd. It’s a terrible tragedy for our society. Mr. Floyd’s death did not need to happen, and we pray tonight for his family and the many others who’ve faced injustices. The City of Fort Wayne respects the rights of individuals to participate in peaceful demonstrations. Tonight’s demonstration in downtown Fort Wayne began peacefully. As the demonstration moved along, it began to get more aggressive and the safety of the public was being put at risk. The Fort Wayne Police Department ultimately had to respond in a manner to protect the public’s safety. It’s vital that we come together united as a city that cares about one another and supports each other. That’s what we’ve been committed to in an effort to make Fort Wayne the best city possible. Now more than ever we need to respectfully and peacefully engage in productive dialogue and understanding as we grieve together, knowing that we can have better days ahead of us.“ A Fort Wayne Police spokeswoman said earlier Friday the department did not anticipate violence at the local protests, which has been the case at protests in Minneapolis and Louisville. Sgt. Sofia Rosales-Scatena said the department recognizes it’s every citizen right to peacefully assemble and protest. She says plans are in place if something happens, but she does not believe officers will have to intervene. She credits much of that to the community relations between officers and residents. “You know we have, always have contingency plans for emergencies, in case things got out of hand. But we’ve always found the citizens of this community have always worked with us. We don’t anticipate this will be anything different than that. We’re going to continue to foster those working relationships with community members of this community. And hopefully we can get through this and move forward.” A second is scheduled to be held Saturday at 2 p.m., also on the courthouse lawn.",0.0

The truck then drove from the interstate ramp to North Broadway and Cass where police arrived to investigate the incident. A call to FedEx for comment was not immediately returned. Demonstrators in St. Louis, like in a dozen other U.S. cities, marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at the police and National Guard to protest the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed by police in Minneapolis on Monday.

Breonna Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A police officer was seen on camera firing what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew during a live television broadcast of the second night of Louisville protests, prompting an apology from the Louisville Metro Police Department. A crew from WAVE-TV was downtown in the Kentucky city Friday night, covering demonstrations over the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her own home in March. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m., as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. As WAVE-TV was on air, reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera: “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as “pepper bullets.” “I want to apologize,” Louisville police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told the Courier Journal. “It’s not something that should have occurred if she was singled out as a reporter.” Halladay said she couldn’t tell who the officer was at this time, but that police would review the video again and “if we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that.” The video shows Rust and the camera crew moving away as indignant in-studio anchors ask if they’re OK and what’s going on. Rust tells them they’re OK, and that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. “Well I’m sure if they would have just said, ‘Move,’ you would have done so,” an anchor is heard telling Rust. A clip of the WAVE-TV broadcast posted to Twitter amassed more than 8 million views in less than six hours, and was retweeted more than 50,000 times, including by other journalists and rapper Ice-T. Louisville’s protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Taylor’s death has captured national headlines alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Taylor and Floyd, whose death has touched off protests across the country this week, including in Minneapolis itself. The use of non-lethal force on the WAVE-TV crew happened the same day CNN employees were arrested live on air while covering protests in Minnesota. Two people were arrested at Friday night’s protest in Louisville, and no significant injuries were reported, Halladay said. That’s in contrast to Thursday night’s protests, where seven people were shot. Louisville police have said officers didn’t fire their service weapons. Mayor Greg Fischer criticized the destruction of property seen Friday night. “This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable. It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor’s memory,” Fischer said in a statement. “Just this morning, Breonna’s family called for peaceful and safe protest.” Fischer said most of the grievances associated with Taylor’s death have been addressed in a live-streamed press conference after 1 a.m. Fischer had announced Friday that the use of no-knock warrants by police were being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and other actions in response to Taylor’s death. Fischer and Halladay said police believed a “significant percentage” of protesters came from outside Louisville. “I don’t know anyone from our great city that wants to destroy it,” he said.

That set off hours of chaos Downtown that stretched into early Saturday when a CVS drug store was set on fire. The protest, like others around the country, follows the death of George Floyd while in he was Minneapolis police custody. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department wore riot gear as they faced off with protestors at the corner of Market and Illinois streets. Police shot gas canisters and rubber bullets. Protestors threw parking cones and other projectiles toward officers. Windows of business near the Statehouse were smashed. On the minds of many is the recent shooting death of Dreasjon Reed by an IMPD officer earlier this month. People were heard chanting “Who killed Dreasjon Reed?” Protestors say they want IMPD to release the name of the officer who shot Reed. The group also chanted ""Whose streets? Our streets,"" ""Black lives matter"" and anti-IMPD calls related to Reed's death. The rally started early in the afternoon on Monument Circle and gained more followers throughout the evening. IMPD and state police officers blocked traffic throughout the downtown area as protestors made their way freely through the streets, often stopping in intersections to chant. Shortly after 10:30 p.m. a call was made by one of the protestors to head home and return at 4 p.m. Saturday to Monument Circle. But dozens then made their way back to the monument where they blocked traffic for a short period of time. By 11 p.m. IMPD officers could be seen arriving in squad cars, exiting their vehicles and putting on gas masks. Soon, an officer on a loud speaker told the protestors they were illegally assembling and would be arrested if they did not leave.

What started as mostly peaceful protests at the beginning of the week has turned into chaos. City leaders have pleaded with communities to voice their outrage in a lawful manner, but the widespread escalation of protests continued Friday night into Saturday. Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, one of the four officers at the scene who were all fired. The Department of Justice has said a full investigation of the incident is a “top priority.” Prosecutors said Chauvin, who was the officer seen in video pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck, had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd was unresponsive for two minutes and 53 seconds of the encounter. This story will be updated as protests continue throughout the country. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern. 9:24 a.m.: FBI director calls George Floyd investigation “a top priority” ABC News has obtained a message to FBI employees sent by FBI Director Chris Wray, on Friday. In it, Wray said the investigation into the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death “is a top priority, and experienced prosecutors and FBI agents have been assigned to the matter.” He said the investigation “will determine whether the actions by the former Minneapolis police officers involved in this incident violated federal law.” He also wrote about how damaging the failure to honor the rights of citizens, particularly those in custody, can be. “Law enforcement officers have indispensable and often dangerous jobs, but that doesn’t diminish the crucial, overarching role we play in society – to protect and serve all citizens no matter their race, creed, orientation, or station in life. This, of course, includes those citizens who are in law enforcement custody,” Wray said. “When we fail to honor their rights, we not only tarnish the badge we wear, we completely erode the trust so many of us in law enforcement work so hard to build, particularly within minority communities. The events this past week in Minneapolis clearly illustrate just how quickly that trust can be lost,” the message stated.” 8:41 a.m.: White House protesters would have been met with “most vicious dogs,” “most ominous weapons,” president tweets President Trump fired off a series of tweets Saturday morning praising the Secret Service after protesters marched in front of the White House Friday night. “They were not only totally professional, but very cool,” he president tweeted. “They let the “protesters” scream & rant as much as they wanted…” he wrote. The president also wrote that if protestors had become “too frisky” or “got out of line,” “they would quickly come down on them,” he wrote. He also tweeted that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would have been “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” He also took a jab at D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. “On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice!,” the president tweeted. 8:19 a.m.: FBI issues statement on Oakland shooting The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a statement after one person was killed, and another injured in a shooting at that took place while protests were happening in Oakland, California. FBI San Francisco and Oakland police are investigating, but it is unknown yet if the shooting is connected to the protest. “FBI San Francisco and the Oakland Police Department are investigating a shooting that occurred at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at 1301 Clay Street in Oakland, California.,” the statement read. “At approximately 9:45pm on Friday, May 29, 2020, a vehicle approached the building. An individual inside the vehicle began firing gunshots at contract security officers for the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security. One officer was killed and another was injured,” according to the statement. “The FBI has deployed investigators and the Evidence Response Team to the crime scene. We will continue to work this investigation alongside the Oakland Police Department,” the statement continued. 7:24 a.m.: Portland mayor declares State of Emergency Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced Saturday morning that he’s declaring a State of Emergency in the city following the destructive unrest in the wake of the death of Floyd. He also announced the city has a curfew in effect until 6 a.m. local time Saturday and will begin again at 8 p.m. “Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything,” Wheeler said in a statement Saturday. “This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting.” Overnight the Portland Police Department declared the protest as a riot after “significant vandalism” was reported and a fire was set inside the city’s Justice Center. Police said there was also a shooting connected to the protest. Police said large sections of downtown were closed and that protesters should “disperse now or you will be subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal.” 5:43 a.m.: 1 dead in Detroit after person opens fire on protesters from vehicle One person is dead in Detroit after a vehicle drove up on people protesting the death of Floyd and opened fire, according to authorities. A gray Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, hitting a 19-year-old man who later died at the hospital, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson told ABC affiliate WXYZ. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the violence and destruction overnight is not what the city of Detroit is about. “This does not represent the vast major of Detroiters who came here to make a statement,” Craig said during a press conference Friday night. “We support the message, but let’s do it peacefully.” He said many of the people taunting police officers and trying to incite violence have come from outside the city to sow chaos. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city. They are not from this city,” Craig said. “Let’s peacefully protest, but outside of that, we’re not going to tolerate it. We’re not going to tolerate criminal acts.” 4:26 a.m.: ‘Prudent’ to have Army units ready to deploy to Minnesota, governor says As fires raged and protests escalated even further throughout Minneapolis Saturday morning, local and state officials said getting the chaos under control will take a response never before seen in the state because “there’s simply more of them than us.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at least 1,000 additional Minnesota National Guard troops would be activated Saturday, and even then, that might not be enough. “You may have seen or heard that, this evening, the president directed the Pentagon to put units of United States Army on alert to possible operation in Minneapolis,” Maj. General John Jensen, Adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard, said during a press conference Saturday. “While we were not consulted with, as it relates to that, I do believe it’s a prudent move to provide other options available for the governor, if the governor elects to use those resources.” Walz said it’s more complicated than just saying yes and deploying them now because the move to have federal troops patrolling in Minneapolis would be something never before seen in the state. “I spoke with President Trump the other night, I think it is prudent to have them ready for us to exhaust all resources that we need,” Walz said Saturday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Walz angrily took to the podium Saturday morning to ask those setting fires, attacking officers and looting businesses to stop. “We as a city can be so much better than this,” Frey said at the press conference Saturday. “There is no honor in burning down your city. There is no pride in looting local businesses that have become institutions of a neighborhood.” He said people, especially during a pandemic, are counting on grocery stores being open to get groceries, pharmacies to get needed medicine and banks to get money. “If you care about your community, you got to put this to an end; it needs to stop,” Frey said. Walz said the tragedy of Floyd’s death has morphed into “an unprecedented threat to our state,” where those causing destruction have no regard to property or life. Dozens of arrests were made on Friday, but an official total has not been released for the city. In one instance, shots were fired at law enforcement officers overnight. 1:48 a.m.: Shots fired at law enforecment officers in Minnesota Shots were fired at law enforcement officers in Minneapolis early Saturday morning near the police department’s Fifth Precinct, according to Minnesota State Police. No officers are believed to have been hit. Following the shots, authorities warned residents to leave the area immediately or they would be arrested. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said there are 350 officers and troopers in the area and “officers have arrested several people who ignored multiple dispersal orders.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz pleaded with protesters overnight to go home. “Minnesotans, please go home. It’s time to restore peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,” Walz said in a statement. “The situation has become dangerous for Minnesotans and first responders.” Protesters took over the Minnesota Police Department’s Third Precinct building late Thursday night and ignited several fires. 12:58 a.m.: LAPD asks residents to stay inside, businesses to close in downtown LA The Los Angeles Police Department has asked downtown Los Angeles residents to stay inside and for all businesses to close due to the escalating protests in the city. “We have declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown LA,” the department said in a statement Friday. The areas impacted are from the 10 Freeway to the 101 Highway and the 110 Freeway to Alameda. “This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage,” LAPD said. “Those on the street are to leave the area.” The department previously asked people to avoid downtown Los Angeles Friday, including nearby side streets and freeways. 12:27 a.m.: Georgia issues State of Emergency, activates National Guard Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced Friday night that he has issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County, where protests have turned violent in downtown Atlanta. He also announced that he’s activating 500 Georgia National Guard members. “At the request of Mayor @KeishaBottoms & in consultation with public safety & emergency preparedness officials, I have issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County to activate as many as 500 @GeorgiaGuard troops to protect people & property in Atlanta,” Kemp tweeted Friday. He said the troops would deploy immediately to help local and state law enforcement officials get control of the “unlawful activity” and to “restore peace.” “We will continue to make all state resources available to local leaders during this emergency situation,” he said. 10:21 p.m.: Protests grow violent in Brooklyn Protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis erupted Friday night in Brooklyn where there have been at least 150 arrests, police sources told ABC News. The protest outside Barclays Center, the home of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, began peacefully, but drew what police sources described as professional agitators and turned ugly. There were more than 100 protesters detained outside the arena, mainly for throwing bottles and other disturbances. Protesters moved toward two police precincts in northern Brooklyn, the 88th Precinct in Fort Green and the 79th Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Along the way, a police van was set on fire and several cruisers were defaced with graffiti and broken windows. Some 500 demonstrators massed outside the 88 Precinct, where the van was set on fire. There were about 40 arrests there. Some demonstrators made it inside the 79 Precinct but were immediately arrested There have been about a dozen officers hurt so far in clashes with the protesters. 9:21 p.m.: Atlanta sees violence spark outside CNN A protest in Atlanta grew violent this evening as a handful of protesters began smashing the doors to CNN Headquarters just after 8 p.m., according to Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB. After defacing the outside of the news network’s HQ and lighting a police car on fire, protesters began throwing objects at police who are inside the building’s lobby. Police were holding a line with shields. “Above everything else, I am a mother. I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a press conference Friday night. “When i saw the murder of George Floyd I hurt like a mother would hurt. And yesterday when I heard about rumors of violent protests in Atlanta, I did what a mother would do, I called my son and said, ‘Where are you?’ I cannot protect you and black boys should not be out today.” “So you’re not gonna out-concern me or out-care about where we are in America,” she added. “I wear this each and every day and I pray over my children each and every day.” 8:19 p.m.: Protest outside White House draws Secret Service  A protest this evening in Lafayette Park just north of the White House has drawn the assistance of the Secret Service. Chants of “Let him breathe,” and, “don’t shoot,” could be heard. The U.S. Secret Service tweeted, “Secret Service personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration in Lafayette Park. In the interest of public safety we encourage all to remain peaceful.” 5:31 p.m.: Trump says he spoke to Floyd’s family  Trump told reporters at a business roundtable event Friday afternoon that he had spoken to the family of George Floyd, four days after his death. “I spoke to members of the family. Terrific people. And we’ll be reporting as time goes by. We think that we’ll also have to make the statement,” Trump said. “It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory — let it be a perfect memory.” The president also took the chance to emphasize peaceful protests, following controversial tweets earlier Friday in which he said “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” “It’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights for peaceful protesters. We can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well,” the president said. “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters.” 4:21 p.m.: Minneapolis, St. Paul enforce curfew Gov. Tim Walz has said a curfew will be in place starting Friday night from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Saturday in the entire Twin Cities region. No one will be allowed in the streets in public except for first responders and media. The curfew will also be in place Saturday night at 8 p.m. to Sunday 6 a.m. “It’s time to rebuild our community and that starts with safety in our streets,” Walz said in a statement. “Thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their grief and frustration in a peaceful manner. But the unlawful and dangerous actions of others, under the cover of darkness, has caused irreversible pain and damage to our community. This behavior has compromised the safety of bystanders, businesses, lawful demonstrators, and first responders. Now, we come together to restore the peace.” Officers will arrest those who do not comply, Walz said. Earlier, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had already issued a curfew order for the city for the same times. 3:40 p.m.: Prosecutors reveal more details about charges on former officer The Hennepin County Attorney released the full criminal complaint for former officer Derek Chauvin. The 44-year-old officer who was filmed putting his knee on Floyd’s neck faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for third-degree murder charges and a maximum of 10 years behind bars for manslaughter charges. “Derek Michael Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd by his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and taking a chance of causing death or great bodily harm to George Floyd,” the complaint read. “The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” according to the complaint. 3:07 p.m.: Floyd’s family responds to former officer’s arrest  While they said they were pleased with that he was apprehended, they said they expected first-degree murder charges. “We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,” they said in a statement. The family also asked for the remaining three officers to be arrested and charged. 2:28 p.m.: Trump tweets against looting President Trump again doubled down on his earlier remarks about the ongoing protests. He tweeted again that “looting leads to shooting” citing “what just happened with 7 people shot.” In Minneapolis. “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means,” he tweeted 2:26 p.m.: Bill Barr releases statement on Floyd death Attorney General Bill Barr said the Department of Justice and FBI are conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated in George Floyd’s death. “The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,” he said in a statement. Barr said the state’s charging decisions will be made first. 1:22 p.m.: Officer arrested in connection with Floyd’s death Derek Chauvin, one of the four former officers fired for their involvement in George Floyd’s death, has been taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is scheduled to give a news conference on developments in the case at 2 p.m.  1:09 p.m.: Cops warn of anarchists infiltrating protests ABC News obtained a police bulletin issued to the Philadelphia Police Department and the Delaware Valley Intelligence Center that warned that anarchists and other groups are calling on their supporters to commit acts of violence against police officers in light of the protests in Minneapolis. The bulletin said there have been several social media posts calling for looting and civil disobedience as well as other acts of violence. “Domestic extremists, including anarchist extremists and other anti-government extremists, are using the unrest in Minneapolis to amplify and justify their calls for dismantling law enforcement agencies and carrying out attacks on law enforcement, government, and capitalist targets,” the bulletin said. The bulletin stressed that non-violent protests are legal and protected by the Constitution. “Anarchist extremists may be attracted to this call to action and engage in direct action against law enforcement property, such as buildings and vehicles, in order to draw attention to their cause,” it said.  12:56 p.m.: Obama offers statement on George Floyd of our darkest chapters’ Former President Barack Obama issued a statement on social media about Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests in Minneapolis. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” he wrote. “It can’t be ‘normal.’ If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.” Obama said it is up to Minnesota officials to ensure that Floyd’s death is fully investigated and justice is ultimately done, however, he encouraged people “to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”  12:40 p.m.: Governor calls on order to be restored after ‘one of our darkest chapters’ Gov. Tim Walz called the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests that took place have been “one of our darkest chapters.” However, he said he refused to let those who caused destruction to Minneapolis “take away the attention of the stain that we need to be working on” and pleaded with the community to help restore order. Walz said that the “looting and recklessness” that occurred was not caused by those who wanted justice for Floyd. “We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues,” the governor said, later calling one of the issues “fundamental institutional racism.” He said that he would not “patronize” the black community as a white man, but asked the community to “help us use a humane way to get the streets back to a place where we can restore justice.” Walz started off his press conference by acknowledging generations of pain and anguish that communities of color in America have experienced. He said that those communities have not been truly heard, “much like we failed to hear George Floyd as he pleaded for his life, as the world watched, by the people sworn to protect him, his community, our state.” The commissioner for the state’s Department of Public Safety called Floyd’s death “murder.” “That’s what it looked like to me,” Commissioner John Harrington said. His comment marked the first time a member of law enforcement call Floyd’s death murder publicly. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison began his remarks by quoting Martin Luther King Jr., saying “riot is the way that the unheart get heard.” He said King urged people not to dismiss non-peaceful protests or relegate it as criminality, but ask what was really going on there. Ellison said that protesters should not react to the National Guard in the way that may react to the Minneapolis Police Department. He noted they are two different agencies and “their job is trying to bring peace and calm back again.” Ellison said that although people continue to ask when justice will be served, he believes authorities understand that “the wheels of justice must turn swiftly.” He also said that while the investigation and criminal procedure for this case is important, it by no means addresses the root of these problems in this country. “I think we’re gonna do some real change. … We’re not just gonna fix the windows and sweep up the glass. We’re gonna fix the broken, shattered society that leaves so many behind.” 11:10 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights. Jenkins said that the anger of the community has been expressed and she did not want further action to lead to injuries or loss of life. “We can’t allow this type of civic unrest to continue,” she said. Jenkins on Thursday called on city officials to declare racism a public health crisis. “By declaring racism a public health emergency it provides us the opportunity to name the virus that has infected our American institutions for centuries but in addition, it gives us the opportunities to … you can’t really begin to cure a disease until you know what that disease is,” she said. “It’s an infectious disease just like the coronavirus and it’s not just Minneapolis.” 11 a.m.: Trump says National Guard is in Minneapolis President Donald Trump tweeted that the National Guard is now in Minneapolis. “They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared,” the president wrote. “George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!” The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Photos showed members of the National Guard in the streets of Minneapolis. Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Thursday activating the Minnesota National Guard after Wednesday night’s destructive protests. 10:50 pm.: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden said he was “furious” over President Donald Trump’s tweet on the protests “I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too,” Biden wrote. Trump tweeted in the early morning hours of Friday that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” referring to the protests. He also called protesters “thugs.” Enough. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 29, 2020 Biden said that he will be speaking more later today about the situation in Minneapolis. He also addressed a CNN crew being arrested. “This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything,” Biden said, with the swift action appearing to refer to their release. 10:20 a.m.: Melania Trump says there is ‘no reason for violence’ First Lady Melania Trump said the nation needs to focus on healing and “there is no reason for violence.” “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she tweeted. “I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now.” Trump also offered her “deepest condolences” to Floyd’s family. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing,” the first lady wrote.  Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 29, 2020 10:09 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights.

It won’t be easy, but it’s essential,” Crump wrote on Twitter. If only I were surprised by this hypocrisy. Minneapolis PD arrests journalists but not murderers from within its own ranks. These problems will require systematic change to start the healing process. It won’t be easy, but it’s essential. https://t.co/2wC3qxLWFT — Benjamin Crump, Esq. (@AttorneyCrump) May 29, 2020 6:59 a.m.: CNN reporter, crew arrested live on air CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his production crew were arrested in Minneapolis live on air Friday morning while reporting on the Floyd protests. The news outlet is reporting that police said they were arrested because they were told to move and didn’t. “A CNN reporter & his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves – a clear violation of their First Amendment rights,” CNN said in a statement Friday morning. “The authorities in Minnesota, incl. the Governor, must release the 3 CNN employees immediately.” Minnesota State Sen. Jeff Hayden phoned into CNN and said he just had a joint text with the governor and mayor and that they were just trying to get control of the area and weren’t aware of the CNN reporter getting arrested. “Hoping that we can figure it out,” Hayden said. 6:44 a.m.: 70 arrested or summonsed in New York City during George Floyd protests At least 70 people were arrested or summonsed during a series of protests that started in Union Square and spread through Lower Manhattan through Thursday night. Most will be summonsed for obstruction of governmental administration and social distancing violations, but there will also be assault and weapon possession charges. The protest began in Union Square after 3 p.m., Thursday but after that broke up, protests reemerged at Foley Square courthouses, City Hall and Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest, and moved toward the West Side Highway. Several police officers were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one with a possible concussion. One person was arrested for assaulting a police officer for throwing a garbage can into a crowd and striking a police officer in the head. Another person attempted to grab the service weapon from a Deputy Inspector’s holster. That person will be charged with robbery. 1:15 a.m.: Trump says military could assume control in city, ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’ President Donald Trump weighed in on the destructive protests in Minneapolis early Friday morning, saying the military could “assume control” of the response. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also attacked Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying the protests are a result of a lack of leadership. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right,” Trump tweeted. Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying it’s weakness to point fingers during times of crisis. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” 12:48 a.m.: Minneapolis asks residents to ‘retreat’ over precinct explosion possibility After people protesting George Floyd’s death forcibly took over a Minneapolis precinct and began to ignite fires, city officials are now warning residents to leave the area in case the building explodes. “We’re hearing unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the Third Precinct have been cut and other explosive materials are in the building,” the city tweeted. “If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes.” Frey said residents must clear the area so the fire department can put out fires. “We are working with @MinneapolisFire to deliver resources and respond for a beloved neighborhood in our city,” Frey tweeted. “We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.” The Minnesota National Guard has been activated for the area and said it’s helping the fire department safely get to fires to help them battle the blazes. Since the protests started, the Saint Paul Police Department said more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted. Despite the destruction, with dozens of fires set, authorities said there are no reports of serious injuries. “Calm on the horizon,” the department said late Thursday night. 12:32 a.m.: Governor ‘shocked’ after vehicle attempts to run over protester Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is “absolutely shocked” by video of a car attempting to run over a person protesting the death of Floyd in Denver on Thursday. What started as a peaceful protest turned chaotic with reports of vandalism and violence. “Tonight is a very sad night for our state. While we are still uncovering all of the facts, a protest regarding the killing of George Floyd devolved into vandalism and violence, and I was absolutely shocked by video evidence of a motorist attempting to run over a protestor,” Polis tweeted. “Coloradans are better than this. I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” Previously shots were fired across the street from Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver. 11:51 p.m.: Protesters gain access to police precinct  People protesting the death of Floyd have reportedly taken over the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct and set it on fire, according to authorities. Minneapolis Police spokesperson John Elder said staff was evacuated from the building around 10 p.m. local time and that protesters forcibly entered the building and ignited several fires. Shortly after reports of the precinct takeover, the Minnesota National Guard said it was deploying more than 500 soldiers to the area. “We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,” the National Guard said in a statement. “Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls.” 9:20 p.m.: Colorado protest marred by gunshots Protesters outside Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver received a scare when someone apparently fired shots nearby, causing the assembled group to flee. There were no injuries, authorities confirmed to ABC News. “Officers on scene at W Colfax Ave and W 15 st on shots fired in the area of the Capital. This is an ongoing investigation and the motive is unknown,” Denver police wrote on Twitter. Leslie Herod, who is a state representative, tweeted about the incident as well. She added that someone was apprehended, though police have not confirmed any arrests. The Capitol was put on lockdown, with Herod, who fled inside included. Herod told an ABC News producer she was not scared by the incident. “No. This only makes me more resolved. We have more work to do,” she said. 8:31 p.m.: 911 call released The 911 call made by the store owner who accused Floyd of using fraudulent money was released by authorities Thursday evening. According to the transcript of the call released by the state of Minnesota, the caller — a store owner — told the operator that Floyd entered the store drunk and tried to pay for something with “fake bills.” He later left the shop and sat on his car. It was there where police found him when they arrived at the scene. “Someone comes [to] our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was [sic] sitting on their car,” the caller said. “We tell them to give us their phone, put their… thing back and everything, and he was also drunk and everything and return to give us our cigarettes back and so he can, so he can go home but he doesn’t want to do that, and he’s sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” The operator then asked the caller for Floyd’s race and sex. “No, he’s a black guy,” the caller replied. “Alright,” the operator said, letting out a sigh according to the transcript, before the caller asked, “How is your day going?” 6:25 p.m.: Investigation is ‘top priority’ for DOJ The Department of Justice has made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority,” Erica MacDonald, attorney for state of Minnesota, said at a press conference. MacDonald said President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr are “directly and actively” monitoring the case. “It is critical, it is essential, it is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time,” she said. “And that is what we are going to do.” No federal or state charges against the officers were announced at the press conference. Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman asked for “patience.” “Give us the time to do this right and we will bring you justice — I promise,” Freeman said. He said his office has been flooded with calls on the status of the investigation. The main question, he said, has been, “what’re you gonna do about the murder of George Floyd?” “We are going to investigate as thoroughly as justice demands,” Freeman said. He called the officer’s action “excessive and wrong,” but said he needs to determine if it was criminal. Both MacDonald and Freeman called on the public to come forward with any information they may have. There was a delay in starting the press conference, which MacDonald apologized for and said she was hoping to share a development but that it was not the right time. 5:35 p.m.: City releases complaint history of 4 officers The police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was involved in 18 complaints prior to being fired, according to records released by the city. Derek Chauvin, who was fired following Floyd’s death, was only disciplined for two of those complaints, according to the city records. The documents do not provide the details of the complaints or the disciplines. Tou Thao, who was the officer seen standing up in the video, had six complaints, one of which remains open, according to the records. Thao, who was also fired, was not disciplined for the other five complaints. The other two officers who were fired, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, have had no complaints. 5:15 p.m.: Governor signs executive order activating National Guard Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard following Wednesday night’s protests. Walz said the purpose of the National Guard was “to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.” “The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,” he said in a statement. “While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved.” The National Guard Adjutant General will work with local government agencies to provide personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to respond to and recover from the protests, according to Walz’s office. There will also be about 200 members of the Minnesota State Patrol that will work with state, county, and local community and public safety partners. State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft on the ground will assist law enforcement officers, the governor’s office said. 5:03 p.m.: Families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery issue joint statement The families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery — all of whom died after incidents with current and former law enforcement — are demanding change and calling for government action to address this “national crisis.” “We’re devastated about the senseless violence that has broken the hearts of our families,” the families said in a joint statement. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive. This is a national crisis and our government needs to take immediate and widespread action to protect our black and brown communities.” The families have called for a congressional hearing and a national task force to create new bipartisan legislation that is aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability. They will also present a case to United Nation Human Rights Committee for sweeping changes to the nation’s criminal justice system. A date for when they would be presenting their case was not provided. Taylor, a black woman, was a front-line worker who died after a police-involved shooting. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping inside their Springfield Drive apartment on March 13 when officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department attempted to execute a “no-knock” search warrant. Three plainclothes officers opened Taylor’s front door and “blindly” opened fire into their apartment, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in April by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Taylor was shot at least eight times and died. Arbery, a black man, was out for a jog when two white men saw him and set off to confront him, police said. The men, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, were armed. A video shows Arbery and Travis McMichael tussling with the shotgun before three shots are fired. Arbery stumbled and fell to the ground, where he was pronounced dead. City leaders react to protests The mayor, police chief and city council vice president in Minneapolis emotionally addressed the violent protests that took place Wednesday night over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point became choked up and tearful, said that the protests were “the result of so much built up anger and sadness.” “Anger and sadness that has been engrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years,” Frey said at a press conference. “If you’re feeling that sadness and anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he knew that there was a “deficit of hope” in the community and that his department has contributed to that deficit. He also said that the violence and destruction seen in Wednesday night’s protest was mostly caused by a “core group of people” who were not from Minnesota. He said that most of the community members who have been protesting since Floyd’s death Monday have been peaceful. Arradondo said he wanted to ensure that people could safely protest, but he said he could not allow for criminal acts. Wednesday night’s protest caused destruction and chaos in Minneapolis, including a deadly shooting, looting and multiple fires. The protests, which had been largely peaceful up until Wednesday night, were in wake of Floyd’s death after he was apprehended by Minneapolis police Monday. Disturbing video emerged on social media showing a police officer with his knee on the man’s neck as the man repeatedly yells out, “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe, please, the knee in my neck,” the man said in a video showing a police officer pinning him to the ground. “I can’t move … my neck … I’m through, I’m through.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins sang “Amazing Grace” at Thursday’s press conference before addressing the protests. Jenkins said she wanted to offer “amazing grace” and her condolences to the Floyd family. “We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks, a knee that says black lives do not matter,” Jenkins, who is black, said. “I am part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks.” Jenkins, Frey and Arradondo said they would be working with the community leaders. A “healing space” will be created at the 3rd Precinct in Minneapolis for residents to express their concerns and anger in a safe and humane way, Jenkins said. Overnight developments Police said during the protests they responded to a call of a stabbing victim and found a man in grave condition near the protests. The man later died in the hospital and authorities learned he died from a gunshot wound, according to John Elder, the director of communication for Minneapolis police. One person was in custody after the shooting, police said. It was not immediately clear what led to the shooting, but the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the owner of a pawn shop opened fire on a man he believed was burglarizing his business and fatally shot him. Police said multiple businesses were looted during the protests and the city’s fire department said there were 30 intentional fires during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires. Massive flames were seen in the sky on videos that circulated throughout social media. As of Thursday afternoon, the fire department said crews were still extinguishing fires along East Lake Street. People were also throwing rocks at fire department vehicles responding to the scene, according to the fire department, which noted there were no firefighter injuries. Elder had said people were throwing rocks at firefighters. Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, wrote on Twitter the family thanked the protesters and wanted peace in Minneapolis, but “knows that Black people want peace in their souls — and until we get #JusticeForFloyd there will be no peace.” “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors and endanger each other as we respond to the necessary urge to raise our voices in unison and in outrage,” Crump wrote Thursday morning. “Looting and violence distract from strength of our collective voice.” Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 — Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 28, 2020 The city requested assistance from the National Guard late Wednesday during the protests, according to ABC Saint Paul affiliate KSTP. The National Guard did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment. “Tonight was a different night of protesting. Last night we had 8,000 protestors all peaceful. Tonight we did not have that,” Elder said. Elder said that there were no serious injuries to officers. He was not sure about the number of people arrested. The fire department said there were no civilian injuries from the fires. Gov. Tim Walz urged people to leave the area as the situation escalated. “The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone’s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene,” Walz wrote on Twitter. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also asked people to evacuate the area. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” Frey wrote on Twitter. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing Floyd’s death. On Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office were conducting a “robust” criminal investigation into his death. “The federal investigation will determine whether the actions by the involved former Minneapolis Police Department officers violated federal law. It is a violation of federal law for an individual acting under color of law to willfully deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” according to a joint statement from United States Attorney Erica MacDonald And FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen. The officers involved in the incident were identified by police as Officer Derek Chauvin, Officer Thomas Lane, Officer Tou Thao and Officer J Alexander Kueng. All four officers were fired, according to Frey. “This is the right call,” the mayor said. The Minneapolis Police Department said Monday that officers were initially called to the scene “on a report of a forgery in progress” in a statement on their website. The statement added that officers were advised that the suspect “appeared to be under the influence” and that he “physically resisted officers.” He later “appeared to be suffering medical distress” and officers called an ambulance. He was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance, “where he died a short time later.” The police department said there were no weapons of any type used by anyone involved in the incident and no officers were injured.

1620976786,2020-05-30 10:36:30,Downtown Protest Turns Ugly Late Friday Evening,https://www.wbaa.org/post/downtown-protest-turns-ugly-late-friday-evening,en,False,,74795,wbaa.org,http://wbaa.org/#spider,"What began as a peaceful protest early Friday evening on Fort Wayne’s Courthouse Green turned into tear gas and riot gear by 8 p.m. Organized by Alisha Rauch to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota on Memorial Day by police officers, the protest started around 5 p.m. with a few hundred gathering along both sides of Clinton Street. For more than three hours, a diverse crowd of white, black, and brown; from old to very young carried homemade signs along the sidewalk, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “No Justice, No Peace” through masked faces. Throughout the early evening, a few protesters mingled with the heavy traffic on Clinton Street, but mostly stayed on the sidewalk. Motorists slowed, honking their horns and raising fists through sunroofs and out of windows. Many captured pictures with their phones, yelling their support. But at about 8 p.m., as the protesters moved north up Clinton Street to the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge, they began to block Clinton Street in its entirety, filling the intersection at Main Street, in an event broadcast live on social media streams by local television stations and citizen cell phones. As shown in the streaming videos, by 9:30 officers from both Fort Wayne Police and Allen County Police had squared off with what was now an angry group of protesters along Wayne Street. As more police arrived in the area, protesters left the intersection of Clinton and Berry streets, and fled from tear gas canisters. Many were prepared with half-gallons of milk to help clear the tear gas from their eyes. It was not the event that Rauch oversaw at 5 p.m. She told WBOI earlier in the evening that the event had grown out of her increased frustration. ""My decision was, it's just after time you see it over and over and over again and then, finally, I was just like 'I'm tired of seeing it, I'm tired of watching. I wanna do, I wanna do something,'"" she said. ""We just want to be felt, we want to be heard. We want them to know that this isn't okay, this isn't okay to us."" At about 9:45, Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry issued a statement about the police actions downtown. “The City of Fort Wayne respects the rights of individuals to participate in peaceful demonstrations. Tonight's demonstration in downtown Fort Wayne began peacefully. As the demonstration moved along, it began to get more aggressive and the safety of the public was being put at risk,” Henry said. “The Fort Wayne Police Department ultimately had to respond in a manner to protect the public's safety. ” This story will be updated.",0.0

1620988731,2020-05-30 07:51:12,National Guard summoned to aid cities amid police clashes,https://www.wane.com/news/national-world/national-guard-summoned-to-aid-cities-amid-police-clashes/,en,True,,94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta and cities nationwide following the death in Minnesota of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody. Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia’s capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives.

(Khadijah via AP) Atlanta officials said crews were unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one whose tooth was knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. An LAPD spokesman told The Associated Press they were still tallying arrests. “I believe in our city. L.A. is strong enough to stand for justice and walk in love,” Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted, cautioning “violence and vandalism hurts all.” San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city’s officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s death. “It was a horrible injustice,” he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Two people were arrested during overnight riots in which protesters set fires throughout downtown and smashed storefront windows, police said, but arrest details were immediately available. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left Portland to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?” Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(WANE) — A night after a protest in downtown Fort Wayne escalated and turned violent and destructive, officials pledged to not allow another event take place. Twenty-nine people were arrested, primarily for disorderly conduct, after a 5 p.m. peaceful protest spilled onto Clinton Street within 90 minutes and eventually took over the roadway. By 8 p.m., police in riot gear fired tear gas into the crowd, and by nightfall, windows of downtown business were shattered and property was vandalized. Mayor Tom Henry, aggressive and emotion in a Saturday morning press conference, said “what we experienced last night is not Fort Wayne.” Henry said a number of the “agitators” were not from Fort Wayne or Allen County, and he said they were the reason a “peaceful demonstration got out of hand.” WANE 15 has learned that of the 29 people arrested Friday evening, all but five were from Fort Wayne. The five out of towners were from Galien, Michigan; Niles, Michigan; Sweetster, Indiana; Mishawaka, Indiana and Fremont, Indiana. “We will not condone what happened last night,” Henry said. “This will not happen again in our city.” Fort Wayne Police Chief Steve Reed said he recognized the reason for the protest, with emotions high after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “Last night is not the answer,” Reed said. “We will not let this happen again. “Going forward we want peace in our city.” Another protest has been scheduled for 2 p.m. in Downtown Fort Wayne. Allen County Sheriff David Gladieux asked the media to cover the event then leave, and not give the protesters the attention they crave.",0.0

Tim Walz tries to calm Minneapolis after days of chaos following George Floyd killing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz pauses during a news conference Friday, May 29, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn., as he talked about the unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd while he was in custody of Minneapolis police. Credit: Glenn Stubbe/Star Tribune/AP (CNN) -- Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appeared before reporters after nights of unrest in the Twin Cities to deliver a clear message: He was taking control. In a sweeping news conference Friday, Walz acknowledged the pain African Americans felt after George Floyd died as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. Amid complaints that he should have acted earlier in the week, he said he was taking control away from local officials, and asked for black residents' help restoring order after rioters set Minneapolis' third precinct police headquarters ablaze Thursday night. But hours later, in the first full night after Walz had deployed the National Guard, it was unclear whether any control had actually been imposed in the tense Twin Cities. Another night of protests raged on and expanded into other cities across the nation. Caravans of protesters on foot and in cars ignored local curfews, with some gathering in areas unpatrolled by police or National Guard members. The property damage and fires that occurred Thursday night in Minnesota took place in other cities, including Atlanta. Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul said Saturday morning that the vast majority of those who were arrested Friday night were outside agitators who were not from the Twin Cities region. Walz called those people a group ""bent on adapting their tactics to make it as difficult as possible"" to maintain order. ""Let's be very clear: The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society and stealing beer and disrupting our great cities,"" Walz said. He said he had mobilized more than 700 National Guard soldiers on Friday night, and that after television cameras found large gatherings of protesters with no police presence at all, he was authorizing the head of the state's National Guard to fully mobilize on Saturday. Walz acknowledged questions about where police and firetrucks were Friday night, saying that ""the situation was so broad and the tactics were so bent on causing destruction"" that resources were spread thin. It all came less than 24 hours after Walz, in a Friday news conference, had sought to assure Minnesotans that he was in control. During his news conference, Walz admonished President Donald Trump for tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" -- a phrase that was widely read as potentially inciting violence toward protesters. Walz said that ""in a moment that is so volatile, anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging."" And he apologized to CNN after a reporting team covering the situation in Minneapolis was arrested early Friday morning. ""That falls squarely on me,"" Walz said. Walz, a 56-year-old first-term Democratic governor who was elected in 2018 after 12 years in Congress, is the latest governor to step into the national spotlight amid a crisis in his state and a cultural clash with Trump. And the political fallout from Floyd's killing and the subsequent protests in Minnesota could be far-reaching as the 2020 swing state faces a new crisis that could compound the coronavirus pandemic. Walz and Trump spoke by phone Thursday night, after Walz had dispatched hundreds of National Guard soldiers to Minneapolis and the surrounding areas. As buildings were burned in protests unfolding in Minnesota, Trump tweeted in the wee Friday morning hours that ""THUGS"" were dishonoring Floyd's memory and that he had told Walz he had the military's support. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Trump tweeted. The tweet was flagged by Twitter for violating the website's rules about ""glorifying violence."" Trump's tweet became a flashpoint, deepening right-wing animosity toward the social media company as the President's words were rebuked by Democrats. In a stark departure from Trump's approach, Walz said Friday morning that Floyd joins a long line of African American victims of police brutality, including Rodney King in Los Angeles and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. ""These are things that have been brewing in this country for 400 years,"" he said. Walz added of Floyd: ""And thank God a young person had a camera to video it."" Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter Friday. Three other officers who were involved in the arrest that led to Floyd's death have been fired. And the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul imposed curfews for over the weekend, though on Friday night those restrictions appeared to be largely ignored and unenforced by police. Walz has faced criticism for failing to deploy the state's National Guard and use emergency powers sooner. At his Friday morning news conference, Walz faced questions over why he hadn't acted as forcefully earlier in the week. Later in the day, Senate Majority Leader Senator Paul Gazelka, a Republican, lambasted Walz, calling his inaction until late Thursday ""a failure of leadership"" that shifted focus away from obtaining justice for Floyd's killing. ""Instead, it's the city up in smoke because the governor didn't take the right action,"" Gazelka said. ""He needs to be responsible for this, not just from today moving forward, but from the beginning as all this unfolded,"" he said. ""To watch our cities burning -- there's no excuse for that."" Walz acknowledged that questions about his early inaction were a ""valid critique."" But he also said he worried that sending an additional police presence into a community that was already protesting police violence would further inflame tensions. He said he had been deferring to local mayors and police, until it became clear Wednesday night that rioting had grown beyond their control. ""If the issue was that the state should have moved faster, that is on me,"" Walz told reporters Friday. Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a long-time ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, on Friday sought to emphasize differences between the Minneapolis Police Department and the state's National Guard. Walz said there is ""no trust"" in Minneapolis police -- but that the National Guard had been sent in to help. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control, to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law collapses, are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain,"" Walz said. ""I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities, and the differentiation between the Minneapolis Police Department that we witnessed losing trust of those they are there to serve is very difficult for people to make."" ""Don't react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department. It's not the same group,"" Ellison said. Walz was also forced to explain Friday why early in the morning, state police had arrested CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his team covering the protests. ""This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen,"" Walz said. He said journalists will play a crucial role as Minnesota seeks to rebuild trust between communities of color and police. ""Please show the world everything that's happening here,"" he said, ""through that lens of professional journalists who ask the questions you're asking today.""

Photo via Malaak Khattab Photo via Malaak Khattab Photo via Malaak Khattab Photo via Malaak Khattab Photo via Malaak Khattab Photo via Malaak Khattab ST.JOSEPH COUNTY, Ind. -- Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the Morris Performing Arts Center in downtown South Bend Saturday afternoon to show solidarity for George Floyd, who died in the hands of a Minneapolis police earlier this week, and for the social injustice across the country. ""Yes, we’re being looked at, but it’s been this way our entire lives. We can’t erase the color of our skin. Some people have an advantage and we don’t, and if they don't use their privilege to flip this negative into a positive, or to make an impact somewhere, then, you’re not doing anything,” Sarah Taylor a protester at the rally said. Trey’von Prowell, one of the organizers of Saturday’s event said the issue of racism has been prevalent in his life since he was a kid. “Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I feel like I was just born with a target on my back and I feel like someone’s bound to watch me or make me feel like I don’t belong,” Prowell said. People held up signs calling for change and chanted as they marched the streets. Organizers saying they didn’t expect such a large crowd. “Young people come into this movement. They can give us energy and they can motivate us to get back in that fight. There’s a lot of people I’ve never seen out here, whole other hundreds, all different races. All different walks of life,” Regina Williams-Preston, a member of the Black Lives Matter in South Bend said. People from all different backgrounds came out to the march to not only show their support for fellow minorities but to also show that injustice is more just a black and white matter. ""This is not just a black-white issue. Latinos are part of the social fabric of America, we helped build this country just like everybody else and we want to make sure that Latinos are represented in the conversation and we want to make sure we see them and we agree that we want to build a better country together,” Paloma Garcia Lopez, a protester of the rally said.",0.0

(WOWO): “I never thought this would happen here.” That’s the sentiment spoken and written by many, in social media posts, messages, phone calls, and in-person conversation, after what started as a peaceful protest in downtown Fort Wayne against police violence against black people – spurred on by the recent viral video of a man who died while being taken into police custody in Minneapolis as a police officer kneeled on his neck – turned violent Friday night. Rocks and water bottles were thrown at police, who had shown to try and get some demonstrators to stop blocking the intersection of Clinton and Fourth Streets. Some of them were walking against traffic, others were sitting in the road. There are some reports that these people were younger than the majority of the demonstrators and may not have been directly affiliated with them. Someone started throwing bottles at police. Tear gas was deployed, affecting both the protesters and the journalists who were there to cover the event as it happened. “As the demonstration moved along, it began to get more aggressive and the safety of the public was being put at risk,” said Mayor Tom Henry. “The Fort Wayne Police Department ultimately had to respond in a manner to protect the public’s safety.” The “I can’t breathe” demonstration started peacefully at the Allen County Courthouse at 5pm, with about 300 attending, but by midnight, the windows of numerous downtown businesses had been shattered and there were still some small ongoing clashes between angry protesters and police. Out of caution, the Young Leaders of Northeast Indiana canceled today’s Farmer’s Market, and some businesses have closed, either to make repairs or out of safety concerns. A “Downtown cleanup” Facebook group has been launched, encouraging people to show up at 10am to help clear some of the damage and debris. The Fort Wayne Police Department is planning a press conference for this morning. As of 7am, no arrests had been reported. Jenica Collins, who had organized Friday’s initial demonstration, told the Journal Gazette she didn’t want “this.” A follow-up demonstration was scheduled for 2pm today but may have been called off.",0.0

(WOWO): Officials from the Fort Wayne Police Department, Allen County Sheriff’s Department, Fort Wayne Ten Point Coalition, a Fort Wayne pastoral group, and Mayor Tom Henry had one message in response to last night’s demonstration over the death of George Floyd that turned into a riot: “This is not Fort Wayne,” Henry said, passionately saying what was reported last night “will not happen again.” He also praised the dozens of people who have since come out to help clean up the damage and debris. Sheriff David Gladieux said anyone who stepped out of line in further protests – with at least one rumored for today – would take a “short ride” to the jail, and that his officers would not be giving people any second chances. He also seemed to blame the media for some of the violence, which involved broken windows, people throwing rocks and bottled water at police and blocking traffic, and police responding with tear gas: “They’re here because you’re here,” Gladieux said to reporters, advising them that for future protests, they should just “get your shot but don’t stick around all night.” Two officers were injured. FWPD Chief Steve Reed said their injuries were minor. 29 people were arrested and held without bond for crimes ranging from disorderly conduct to vandalism. “What was so painful turned out to be a problem for the rest of us,” said Robert Bell of United Pastors of Fort Wayne. “It got out of hand and, sadly, nobody could get it back without the police.” Officials said the vast majority of those arrested, and they believe those who got people agitated in the first place, were “outsiders” from out-of-town. They would not go into detail as to where, or if they represented any particular group. A full list of arrests would be provided this afternoon, an FWPD spokesperson said.

(WPTA21) - After a night of unrest and another protest scheduled for Saturday afternoon, area leaders are asking for peace. Friday evening, organizers planned an ""I Can't Breathe"" protest at the Allen County Courthouse green to demand justice for George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. The white officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes is now facing murder charges in his death. A large gathering of protesters filled the Allen County Courthouse green and sidewalk early Friday evening. However, as the night progressed, some people filled the streets and some were seen climbing on vehicles on Clinton Street. The Ten Point Coalition was called in to usher people out of the street. Some people complied, while others stayed in the intersection. That's when police stepped in and the clashes began. Fort Wayne Police Chief Steve Reed began a Saturday morning news conference calling for unity. ""We stand here today united. We say that peaceful protests are welcome in our city. For a few hours that protest was just that: peaceful. But then events took place for a turn violent,"" Chief Reed said. ""However last night is not the answer. We will not let this happen again."" Law enforcement said 29 people were arrested. The charges were primarily disorderly conduct and failure to exit an emergency area. Most of those people are being held without bond until they can have their court appearance. Allen County Sheriff David Gladieux said a local judge authorized those 29 people arrested to be held on a 72 hour hold. ABC21 is working to learn this judge's name. Chief Reed said people were throwing rocks and water bottles at officers, and two police officers were injured. ""We want peace in our city. We want productive conversation moving forward."" Fort Wayne leaders and law enforcement believe Friday evening's protests that started off peaceful and then led to clashes with police were sparked by outsiders. Allen County Sheriff Gladieux said he believes people who came from out of town helped rile up the crowd ""My agency will be handling things a little bit differently. We will not tolerate water being thrown at our officers. There will be no second chances,"" Sheriff Gladieux said. ""There will be no questions. No second chances. It will just be a quick band ride a few blocks north."" Fort Wayne Mayor Tom Henry said what happened last night is not a representation of our city. ""That's not the way that you demonstrate here in Fort Wayne,"" Henry said. ""My friends, last night was not Fort Wayne...this will not happen again in our city."" Saturday morning, citizens are cleaning up the mess of glass, dirt, trash and other debris left from the unrest. Pastor Luther Whitfield Fort Wayne UNITED said his heart grieves with the Floyd family. ""I understand the anger. I understand the injustice that takes place so many times,"" Whitfield said. ""But what I'm also afraid of, is if we condone what happened last night, then we are being unproductive. We are doing a great disservice, a disgrace to the Floyd family."" Pastor Robert Bell, who represents the United Pastors of Fort Wayne, said last night was a wakeup call. ""We do not condone the behavior that was shown last night. The protesters had a right to protest. They had permission to protest. Somewhere, somehow, it got out of hand,"" Bell said. Fort Wayne United Director Iric Headley said the motive last night was good, but the method was the issue. ""We want what took place in Minneapolis to stop,"" Headley said. ""But to everyone out there: your voices need to be heard. But they cannot be heard, and they won't be heard. They will be diluted and distorted by what we've seen. Our community did not deserve what we had last night."" It is unclear if protesters will gather again Saturday afternoon. ABC21 will have a team of journalists ready to bring you live coverage this afternoon and on ABC21 News at 6 and 11 p.m.",0.0

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn’t offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. “It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.” ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Officials in Minneapolis say they’ve succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. — The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting “George Floyd,” referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd’s neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES — The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation’s second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY — Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah’s governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada — City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a “heavy police presence” would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. — More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting “No Justice, No Peace.” But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI — A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 “singing, we were doing poetry” and urging each other not to “break windows” or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. “There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,” 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. “Most of them were kids. They couldn’t’ have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;” They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. “A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren’t letting us,” Hatta said. “They basically trapped us in.” ___ ATLANTA — An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES — Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON — The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” He also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” In a tweet, Trump said: “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest.” He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee — The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state’s capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize “in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.” ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police’s 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO — Chicago’s mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has “devolved into criminal conduct.” She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor’s words: “We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.” ___ MIAMI — An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA — Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city’s doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia’s mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control “the escalating situation” in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities’ call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE — The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn’t available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that ”the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.” ___ ATLANTA — A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor’s mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city’s affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta’s mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd’s death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state’s attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council’s 13 members say they support a call from Floyd’s family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck Monday. The council members say they don’t think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON — Several hundred people shouting “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to “stop mob violence.” Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.” Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA — Atlanta’s mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a “very unusual and extreme step” after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd’s death. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday’s protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK — Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan’s East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn’s Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which “protesters were handled very violently” by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla — President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that “my administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold.” Trump says that “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.”",0.0

Here's what we know: 1 p.m. protest Local resident Malik Muhammad said earlier Saturday that he is expecting about 400 for a protest in front of the Indiana Convention Center. Just over 100 people had RSVPs to the Facebook event as of 12:30 p.m. ""Minneapolis will be out in protest again Saturday, let’s show support and solidarity,"" the Facebook invite reads. 4:30 p.m. protest Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student, said she is organizing a protest in front of the Indiana War Memorial. Nearly 650 people have RSVPd to the Facebook event as of 12:30 p.m. Brown said the event will formally end at 9:05 p.m. What's planned Both organizers said the intent is for the protests to be peaceful. Brown said she hopes to have activists ready to make speeches and promote nonviolence. Brown said the protesters will march to the City-County Building at 5:30 p.m. to show solidarity with anyone arrested Friday night and for people who were arrested under means of excessive force. How officials are preparing Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett and Police Chief Randal Taylor will hold a press conference at 1:30 p.m. to address Friday night's events and Saturday's planned protests. Why people are protesting Protests across the nation were sparked by the May 25 police-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a black man, died after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His arrest was captured on video and widely shared on social media. Protesters in Indianapolis said Friday they are also protesting the police-involved shooting death of 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed on May 6. Reed was fatally shot by an officer following a pursuit on the city's north side. Part of the pursuit and the shooting were streamed live on Facebook. Police said Reed had been driving recklessly and they found a gun at the scene of his shooting that had been fired. The Facebook invite for Saturday's 1 p.m. protest says ""all across the nation we are oppressed by the police."" The 4:30 p.m. event is to protest ""the wrongful murders of Dreajon Reed in our own city but as well as the murders of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Nina Pop, Ahmaud Arbery, and more,"" the Facebook event reads. ""We will also protest against the leadership in our country that is insinuating violence against Black people.""

Hogsett said he was ""horrified by the needless killing"" of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis that sparked protests across the country on Friday night. ""The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed,"" he said. ""At a successful protest that occurred last night, hundreds of residents did just that, peacefully exercising their right to free speech."" But a small group of people unfortunately ""abandoned this message of positive change"" after organizers ended the event, Hogsett said. ""I am saddened that so many people and businesses were injured in the violence that ensued,"" he said in the statement. ""While the emotions that fueled this vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused are simply unacceptable and did nothing to further the cause of progress."" Shots were fired at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy just after midnight at 1 American Square downtown, police said. The suspect was not in custody, police reported at the time, and the deputy was not injured and did not return fire. Gov. Eric Holcomb said he has asked the Indiana State Police to help ensure public safety for communities statewide. “Hoosiers have long been people who find solutions to the challenges we face, whether it be in response to a pandemic or to an injustice like the world witnessed so tragically inflicted upon Mr. George Floyd in Minnesota,"" Holcomb said in a written statement. “As I stated yesterday, injuring the innocent in response to an injustice is counterproductive. ... In the days ahead, peaceful assembly and clear voices will be important if we are to make progress. Violence and vandalism will set us back in our shared desire to resolve differences.” Other officials have also weighed in on protests over the killings of black citizens by police that have rocked the nation — particularly following the recent deaths of Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky and Dreasjon Reed here in Indianapolis. City-county councilor Blake Johnson also acknowledged in a statement on Twitter that systemic racism and oppression of people of color is a ""poison that has been in the veins of our nation since its inception."" ""And as life after life is senselessly lost, the rightful frustration, distrust, pain and fear from simply being black in America yields what we saw last night,"" Johnson wrote. ""I'm angry about the violence, the destruction. That's the point. We should be angry that we still live in a society where this happens."" The Indy Chamber, which represents businesses like the ones vandalized Friday night, issued a statement that also recognized the longstanding frustration over violence against communities of color. “When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury,” President and CEO Michael Huber said in a statement. “Violent acts against fellow citizens and local businesses must not continue.“ This story will be updated.

Hogsett said he spoke with a handful of organizers of Saturday’s demonstrations, who he hopes will instruct residents to return home around 7 p.m. so any crowds Downtown will have dispersed by nightfall. “I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,” Hogsett told residents. “But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love.” On Friday night, crowds gathered in protest of the killing of black citizens by police, including Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and most recently George Floyd in Minneapolis. But after the conclusion of planned gatherings, city officials say crowds swelled, and officers began deploying chemical agents to break up any lingering groups of demonstrators. ""There was an immediate escalation from a peaceful protest to vandalism and other violent acts,"" Taylor said. The evening’s demonstrations spilled into the early hours of Saturday morning and saw 27 arrested, three IMPD officers injured and three civilians injured, Taylor said, including one who sustained “severe lacerations” while kicking glass. Those three civilian injuries, IMPD later said, were not caused by officers. However, that number does not include demonstrators who were affected by chemical deterrents used by officers. ""Our first responsibility is always to keep our residents safe, and we have a responsibility to intervene in the actions of individuals who threaten our city,"" Taylor said. “We swear an oath to do just that. Fulfilling that oath, keeping our community safe, will continue to be our focus as we respect our residents’ rights to lawful protest.” More:Indianapolis business leaders call for end to violence and looting Earlier Saturday, Gov. Eric Holcomb released a statement saying he has asked the Indiana State Police to provide additional aid to local agencies responding to demonstrations. Hogsett said he had not yet requested additional aid for Indianapolis as of Saturday night but was aware of the option. An estimated 30 businesses were damaged amid the tumult, including a CVS storefront that was smashed and set on fire. Several IMPD vehicles were also damaged, Taylor said. Hogsett cautioned that while remaining Downtown following the conclusion of any demonstration is not in itself reason for arrest, those committing acts of violence or other illegal activities are subject to arrest. “While the emotions that fueled last night’s vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused were unacceptable,” he said. “And it did nothing to further the cause of progress.” In his Saturday morning meeting, which he said included representatives from Indy10, Black Lives Matter and Dreasjon Reed's mother, Hogsett said he recommitted to continuing reform as it pertains to community policing, accountability and transparency. He pointed to efforts to obtain body cameras and the addition of civilians to a use-of-force review panel as progress in those areas. “As stewards of the public’s collective well-being,” Hogsett said, “we must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless.” The protests are part of a nationwide trend of unrest over police killings of black citizens, which drew throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities.

Though Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did take some bold steps following Floyd’s death, including calling for justice and working with his police chief to fire Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as the 46-year-old father begged for his life, the overall response has fallen woefully short in a city that’s been divided by race and inequality for decades. MINNESOTA GOVERNOR AUTHORIZES ‘FULL MOBILIZATION’ OF STATE’S NATIONAL GUARD, SAYS PROTESTS NO LONGER ABOUT DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD On Saturday morning, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced the full mobilization of the state’s National Guard for the first time in its 164-year history. It’s a start, some say, but a move that should have been made days ago. Walz and Frey, both Democrats, have been hammered over their nearly non-existent response to the growing crisis in Minneapolis which went from a peaceful protest over Floyd’s death to an all-out assault on the city, its businesses and even residents. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It’s about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” While that may be, residents say there’s still a growing problem and its elected leaders need to address it immediately. “It looks like a war zone,” Jeff Boggs, an Atlanta native who moved to Minneapolis three years ago, told Fox News. By almost all accounts, the presence of law enforcement has been nearly undetectable as the violence in Minneapolis escalated from Friday night into Saturday. AT TRUMP REQUEST, PRENTAGON PUTS MILITARY POLICE ON ALERT TO GO TO MINNEAPOLIS While there had been police officers, state troopers and even some National Guard members in armored vehicles dispatched to deal with rioters, any authority they possessed was ignored. According to local reports, orders issued by bullhorn to disperse were laughed off and it seemed no one paid any attention to the state’s 8 p.m. curfew. The Minneapolis Star Tribune’s editorial board also blasted local leaders for failing to gauge the severity of the situation and not realizing that “Floyd’s death could set off a powder keg.” “Where were the plans that should have already been in place at every level – city, county and state – to deal with prolonged civil arrest? Such episodes are not unknown in American history,” the board said. “As Frey himself said at one point, the issues here have been brewing in this country for 400 years.” The sight of looters ransacking stores and arsonists laughing as the city burned around them has shaken what little confidence people had that their elected leaders would come to the rescue. “It feels like we’re on our own,” Boggs said. On Friday, with smoke drifting over Minneapolis, Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests. The Democratic governor said the state would take over the response and that it was time to show respect and dignity to those suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire,” he said. “The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard. Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world – and the world is watching.” Walz said he received a call from a state senator who described her district as “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came after a night of mayhem and havoc that led to protesters torching a police station that officers were forced to abandon. On Friday, Frey, who was taking questions from reporters, seemed visibly shaken. When a journalist asked, “What’s the plan here?” Frey responded, “With regard to?” He added, “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that…What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” FERGUSON BUSINESS OWNER WHOSE SHOP WAS DESTROYED IN 2014 RIOTS CALLS ON PROTESTORS TO HALT DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES Frey also defended the city’s largely hands-off approach with the looters. “We are doing everything that we can to keep the peace,” he said, adding that National Guard members were stationed around the city at banks, pharmacies and grocery stores. His comments as well as the ones made by Walz hasn’t had the calming effect that was probably intended. State Rep. Hodan Hassan tweeted Friday, “The city of Minneapolis has a responsibility to put out fires and protect its residents. The fire on Park Ave is reaching a residential area and there is a gas station nearby. For our city’s leadership to say they won’t send a firetruck is irresponsible.” President Trump’s ill-fated Friday morning tweets in which he threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” referred to protesters as “thugs” and claimed, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” seemed to only douse fuel on the growing dumpster fire. Trump also took aim at the city’s “total lack of leadership.” He followed it up on Saturday slamming Frey. “Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis will never be mistaken for the late, great General Douglas McArthur or great fighter General George Patton. How come all of these places that defend so poorly are run by Liberal Democrats? Get tough and fight (and arrest the bad ones). STRENGTH!” Trump tweeted. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP",0.0

Evansville Courier & Press Update 7:45 p.m: 4 arrested at protests Sgt. Nick Winsett, spokesman for the Evansville Police Department, said that an escalation at the Civic Center about 5:15 p.m. happened when two of the protestors crossed over the line in what Winsett's statement deemed ""an attempt to provoke officers."" ""At that point things were being thrown at officers and one of the police horses was struck in the face,"" Winsett's statement said. ""During one of the arrests another officer was struck as well."" Three adults and one juvenile were arrested on various charges, including battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct and resisting law enforcement. One of the protestors, Talaya Meriweather, said she knew a teenager whom she called ""Randall,"" arrested and thought it was not fair. She said she saw Randall tackled by four officers after he had crossed over the line. ""I know him and he's the nicest, most respectful kid,"" she said. ""People had been stepping over that line all day but nobody got arrested. If they had explained to him he would have gone back to the other side. But I don't think they gave him the chance."" At 5:26 p.m., the assembly was deemed unlawful by EPD officers, and orders given for the crowd to disperse in a specified amount of time. The crowd left the area with no further physical incident. ""No tear gas was deployed and no use of force was needed,"" Winsett said. 5:50 p.m: Police warn crowds to leave Police have said the assembly is unlawful and have told protestors they need to leave. ""Remain in the area and you're subject to arrest. This is declared an unlawful assembly,"" police were heard saying on loudspeakers. Several protesters told the Courier & Press they were threatened with tear gas. A large portion of them left while there are some are still straggling. Some people were driving around the block with a loudspeaker yelling at police. Several roads around the Civic Center were blocked by police. State Police were assisting. The Armored Patrol Carrier and mounted patrol officers were helping block intersections as well. Minutes earlier the scene was chaotic with the situation escalating and officers in riot gear moving protestors across Martin Luther King Boulevard. Since about 1:30 p.m. there had been a line of protestors and police facing off right in front of the Civic Center with a concentration in front of EPD's offices. 4 p.m.: Crowd thins The crowd at the Civic Center has thinned out significantly but there are still sporadic interactions with officers. In several instances, different protesters have gotten in the face of stoic officers. There still are about 200 with signs and chanting in the lawn and on the sidewalk in front of the Civic Center. There are still several cars driving by blaring their horns in support and cheering. 2:30 p.m.: Protest gets tense Ralliers marched along Riverside Drive and on the Greenway with many making their way to the Civic Center, which houses Evansville Police Department. A crowd of a couple hundred gathered outside with a line of protestors facing off with EPD officers with riot shields and some wearing a full helmet with face mask. The mounted patrol was also present. Protesters chanted, ""Hands up don't shoot"" and ""No justice, no peace."" Horns blared and people cheered. At one point protesters were all told to ""take a knee"" and they could be seen lowering down to one knee with their right arm in the air. There were many verbal confrontations between individual officers and protesters, although things have remained peaceful. CLOSE An anti-violence protest in Evansville Saturday, May 30, grew more tense, but remained peaceful, as protesters reached the Civic Center. Evansville Courier & Press Previously: EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Their signs bore slogans such as ""Mad As Hell,"" ""Stop Killing Black People"" and ""Make Racists Afraid Again."" More than 500 gathered at Downtown Evansville's Riverfront at the Four Freedoms for Saturday's anti-violence rally, called ""We All Bleed Red"" by its organizers. Rally organizer, Ebon Ellis, said he was moved to plan it after seeing the video of George Floyd's death as a Minneapolis Police officer kneeled on his neck. ""We see these things, and we share it, but we don't come out and speak against it,"" Ellis said. ""We need to be speaking out and stepping out in faith! I was afraid to speak out, afraid I didn't have the platform for it, but when people you look to step up don't do that, well, you just have to take a leap of faith."" Protests and rallies across the country have turned violent with seven people shot at a protest in Louisville Thursday and dozens more injured at rallies in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Atlanta and more throughout the country. CLOSE Organizer Ebon Ellis speaks to an Evansville anti-violence Rally Saturday, May 30, 2020, at Four Freedoms Monument Evansville Courier & Press Ellis, though, stressed the gathering would be peaceful and implored people to respect that. Ellis, speaking to the crowd, pointed out that he invited the Evansville Police Department to attend in good faith, saying the rally was not intended to be anti-police in any way. ""Booooo!"" one man screamed at the mention of police. He was hissed at by many in the crowd. ""Hey, don't do that,"" one woman said to him. Another man yelled, ""I smell bacon, I smell grease. I smell the Evansville City Police!"" While some laughed at his limerick, many were not amused. Ellis defrayed the moment by reiterating his earlier words. ""Hey, we don't want that!"" Ellis responded. ""We are not anti-police. We are anti-wrong. We want justice. We want convictions."" Samantha Moorman held up a poster-sized picture of Mariah Strother. Strother, 20, was shot and killed early Saturday morning at a gas station on the South Side of town. ""She was like my a baby sister to me,"" Moorman said through tears. ""I went to the gas station, and her blood was splattered all over the ground."" Also killed was 20-year-old Keijuan Baker. Police said they have no suspects. Moorman said she called 911 to ask why her ""little sister's"" blood was still on the ground. ""I pleaded with them and the people at the gas station"" she said. ""They said they had done the best they could do, and there was nothing else they could do. It was like it didn't matter to them at all."" Moorman said she went inside the gas station, got some gloves, got down on her hands and knees and started scrubbing the sidewalk herself. ""I scrubbed it until my hands were bleeding from the broken glass on the ground,"" she sobbed. ""I had to stop because my hands were all cut up. ""We have to stop fighting, and we have to start loving one another!"" she said. Buy Photo Hundreds march down Riverside Drive during an anti-violence protest in Evansville Saturday, May 30, 2020.

I believe your presence here today has allowed for you to get outside of your comfort zone and to step outside of yourself to show compassion and love for others. It also represents taking a stand.

Warning: Raw footage. Audio may include rough language. Evansville Courier & Press Mayor Lloyd Winnecke and State Rep. Ryan Hatfield both spoke at the rally. ""It's fitting we can gather by the hundreds at this beautiful moment,"" Winnecke said to the crowd. ""To express our disgust and dismay. Mr. Floyd should not be dead. These issues should have been solved generations ago. ""I believe there is justice and goodness in everyone,"" he continued. ""We have to dig deep within ourselves and find it ... but even that's not good enough. We have to be willing to look for it in everyone else, too."" Hatfield spoke briefly, but passionately, saying “Ahmaud Arbery is dead because he was black! Tamir Rice died because he was black. And Breonna Taylor is dead because she was black! ""Here’s my message, stop killing black folks!” Someone called out, ""When you go back to your office, what are you going to do different, politicians?"" The crowd applauded that, while Winnecke continued to talk about E is for Everyone which means supporting “justice and goodness.” 'I'm outraged': 'I'm outraged': Evansville reacts to George Floyd's death Buy Photo Hundreds gathered at an anti-violence protest in Evansville Saturday, May 30, 2020. (Photo: MACABE BROWN / COURIER & PRESS) Ebon Ellis said that while Floyd's death led him to act, the problem of deadly violence against black men — whether or not at the hands of the police — is much larger and happens here, too. He said he didn't want the news out of Minneapolis to overshadow the killing of Larry Meriweather Jr., a 30-year-old man who was fatally shot at a house party in Evansville in the early morning hours Tuesday. ""We want the violence to stop,"" Ellis said. ""To me, it's accountability. I want everybody, whether you wear a uniform or not, to be held accountable for your actions.""Ellis dubbed the rally ""We All Bleed Red,"" to encourage attendees to recognize their shared humanity. It will include prayer and the testimonies of people affected by violence. ""No matter where we come from, whatever skin color, your neighbor is your neighbor,"" Ellis said. ""I want us all to just realize that we all are part of the same human race."" Around 1 p.m. the rally transitioned to a march with chants of ""I can't breathe"" and ""No justice, no peace,"" could be heard. The gathered crowd began to march with others lining Riverside Drive chanting as cars drove by blaring their horns and yelling support. The ended at the Civic Center were at 2:15 p.m. they continued to rally facing off against EPD officers with riot gear. County Commissioners Jeff Hatfield and Ben Shoulders were among the hundreds present, which included people of all races. Both said they were there to condemn racism and were glad the event was peaceful. Bart Lindenschmidt stood in the crowd with a Veterans for Peace t-shirt, holding a sign in support. ""I'm just really tired of racism and violence against our minorities, blacks in particular it seems,"" said Lindenschmidt, who is white. ""There's just too much death at the hands of cops. I'm not saying all cops are racist, because obviously they are not, but there's too many of them on the force because this keeps happening time and again. You'd think after Trayvon Martin and others that happened, things would have changed. But it doesn't seem to be changing. ""I'm just here to stand in solidarity with my black brothers and sisters and everybody that's been subject to injustice for centuries in this country unfortunately.""

By Nicole Chavez, Jason Hanna, Dakin Andone and Madeline Holcombe, CNN (CNN) -- Protests over the death of George Floyd raged from coast to coast -- with crowds breaking curfew in major cities on another night of fury and frustrations. Fires burned and and tear gas canisters flew in Minneapolis as people threw objects at officers. In Seattle, smoke filled the air as police in riot gear lined up outside stores. And in Philadelphia, firefighters doused blazes and officers chased a group of protesters down the streets for violating curfew. The words ""I can't breathe"" were scrawled on a building not far from where smoke billowed. Looters ransacked stores on the famous Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, leaving shelves bare and setting some buildings ablaze. The National Guard dispatched to Washington, DC, to assist police handling protests around the White House, authorities said. At least 25 cities have imposed curfews and numerous states activated National Guard forces in anticipation of another night of protests, sparked in part by the death of Floyd -- who was unarmed and handcuffed -- while in Minneapolis police custody. The former officer seen in a video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested and charged. Protesters are demanding the arrest of three other officers at the scene. Live updates: Protests spread nationwide Latest developments • City curfews: A curfew is underway in cities like Atlanta, Philadelphia and Milwaukee until Sunday morning. Mayors in cities like Denver, Cincinnati, Louisville and Salt Lake City imposed evening curfews that will expire Monday morning. • Officer injured: A Philadelphia bike officer trying to stop people involved in looting was run over by the suspects while escaping. The officer is in the hospital with a broken arm and other injuries. At least 12 other officers were injured. • National Guard: Several states and the District of Columbia have either activated or requested assistance from the National Guard, including Minnesota, Georgia, Ohio, Colorado and Kentucky. • 21-year-old shot: A young man was killed Friday night in downtown Detroit where protests were taking place. Police had previously said the victim was 19 and that they could not confirm whether the victim was part of the protests. Minnesota officials say outsiders are hijacking protests State and local authorities said the violence in Minneapolis was being fueled by outsiders. ""Nothing we do to provide justice"" for Floyd ""matter(s) to any of these people who are out here firing upon the National Guard, burning"" businesses and ""disrupting civil life,"" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters on Saturday. The governor said he understands that ""Minnesotans' ... inability to deal with inequality"" and racism was the catalyst for the protests -- but he said rough estimates indicate only 20% of protesters there are Minnesotans. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said everyone arrested in his city on Friday night was from out of state. A CNN analysis of data from the Hennepin County Sheriff's office showed that more than 80% of those booked into jail on riot and other potentially riot-related charges over the last two days were from Minnesota. Of the 51 people booked into jail between noon Thursday and noon Saturday on riot, unlawful assembly, burglary or damage to property charges, a total of 43 had an address listed in Minnesota, the data showed. The data only covers people booked into jail, not necessarily all arrests. Hennepin County includes Minneapolis, but not St. Paul. John Harrington, the state public safety commissioner, said that assertions about outside agitators come partly from arrest data as well as information from fliers and online postings. Officials did not provide further details about who exactly was fueling the unrest and where they were from. Harrington said he hoped to release more information later Saturday. US Attorney General William Barr said the ""voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements"" pursuing ""their own separate and violent agenda."" Without citing evidence, the attorney general said that in many places ""it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom traveled from outside the state to promote the violence."" A Justice Department spokeswoman later said the information underpinning Barr's assertion came from state and local law enforcement. Vandalism in Los Angeles and Chicago Protests were underway Saturday in cities like Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, where several Secret Service vehicles were vandalized with graffiti outside the White House. A demonstration in Los Angeles led to clashes between police and protesters. Police vehicles were vandalized in Los Angeles by some protesters who kicked in the windows or sprayed the cars with graffiti. Police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators, who chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""George Floyd."" Aerial footage from CNN affiliate WLS showed protesters in Chicago vandalizing police vehicles. Some threw water bottles at police officers in riot gear, while others were seen lifting police barricades and throwing them at police cars. In Philadelphia, police said protests at City Hall and the Art Museum began peacefully before a group of others began ""committing criminal acts, including vandalism."" In Atlanta, police braced for more potential protests and arrests Saturday night. Members of the National Guard gathered at Lenox Square Mall after the police department said it would be assisted by about 20 other agencies to monitor activity and ""protect vulnerable business districts and retail centers"" Protests turned deadly in some cities A nation cooped up for weeks over coronavirus restrictions and suffering from resulting job losses saw throngs of people demonstrating in the streets of more than 30 cities on Friday. People initially gathered peacefully in some places but anger boiled over as the hours passed. At a protest in Detroit, one person was shot dead. In Oakland, California, one Federal Protective Service officer was killed and one other injured Friday in a shooting at the downtown federal building during protests in the city, police said. Details about what led to the shooting weren't immediately available. ""It's about time this police brutality has to stop. I don't agree with breaking into all of the businesses, but I can understand the outrage after REPEATED incidents,"" Mackenzie Slagle said of protests in Oakland. ""Because I'm a white woman, and I needed to show up for all my brothers and sisters."" In Atlanta, protests turned violent when a crowd set fire to a police car and smashed windows at CNN Center. ""What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. ""Killer"" was scrawled across a damaged police car in Los Angeles where protesters lined up along a freeway to block traffic. At least two officers were injured during the night, said the LAPD. But other cities saw a contrast of demonstrators. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the demonstrations, some protesters knelt under a bridge and prayed while others tossed rocks at officers who fired rubber bullets in return. Minneapolis and St. Paul were under a curfew after looting and arson broke out during days of protests. But hundreds took to the streets as police fired tear gas and protesters hid behind cars. And in Springfield, Massachusetts, hundreds gathered peacefully. ""If you can tell me something better for me to do -- if you can tell me a way that we could change the world without trying to make noise like that, then I'll get out of the streets,"" Max Bailey, 22, said at the protests in Denver. Video shows 3 officers kneeling on George Floyd Derek Chauvin, the former officer charged in Floyd's death, is being detained at the Ramsey County Jail in Saint Paul, a spokeswoman with the state's bureau of criminal apprehension told CNN. He is facing third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. His bail has been set at $500,000. Chauvin, who is white, and three other officers detained Floyd, who was black, in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Outrage grew after a video surfaced showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for a total of 8 minutes, 46 seconds, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. All four officers were fired this week after Floyd's death. New video posted on social media appears to show three Minneapolis police officers -- not just Chauvin -- kneeling on Floyd during his arrest. CNN has not been able to locate the person who shot the footage. The new video shows the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle -- the side opposite shown in the first video. A preliminary autopsy said the combined effects of Floyd being restrained, potential intoxicants in his system and underlying health issues, including heart disease, contributed to his death. So far, there are physical findings to support strangulation as the cause of death, the medical examiner said but CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned it doesn't necessarily mean Floyd didn't die from asphyxiation. CNN has reached out to the former officer's attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.",0.0

Floyd, 46, was pronounced dead Monday night after he was pinned to the ground under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. In a video recorded by a bystander, Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. Four police officers – Chauvin, Tomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J. Alexander Kueng – were fired from the force Tuesday. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in the third degree. Here is a list of some of the cities where protests have erupted: Minneapolis, Minn. Mayor Jacob Frey (D) Peaceful protests broke out a day after Floyd’s death. The demonstrations quickly escalated to outright violence and looting. For several days after, city residents woke up to fires still burning from the violent protests. The building of the Minneapolis Police’s 3rd Precinct was overtaken by protesters and burned down. Demonstrators then converged about four miles near the 5th Precinct building. Early Saturday morning, protesters were seen defying curfew orders issued by Frey as firefighters sought to put out several business and brush fires after the fourth night of unrest. The curfew lasts from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. and any violation of it could lead to a misdemeanor charge, which entails 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. MINNESOTA GOVERNOR, MAYOR SLAMMED BY LOCAL PRESS, POLITICIANS FOR RESPONSE TO DEATH, RIOTING Gov. Tim Walz, who authorized the “full mobilization” of the state’s National Guard, said it’s the largest civilian deployment in the state’s history. He said it was three times the size of what was in place during the race riots of the 1960s. The Pentagon has been ordered to prepare troops to be sent to the Twin Cities, a move said to be rare in nature. “This is no longer about protesting,” Frey said Saturday. “This is about violence and we need to make sure that it stops.” NIKE RELEASES AD IN WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: ‘FOR ONCE, DON’T DO IT’ Detroit, Mich. Mayor Mike Duggan (D) Some 1,500 people demonstrated peacefully Friday in Detroit as part of the nationwide protests. Police Chief James Craig said one person was killed and more than 40 people were arrested. He said at least three-fourths of the demonstrators were from outside of the city. A DPD spokesperson said a grey Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, striking a 19-year-old man. The shooting did not involve the police. Portland, Oregon Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) Police in Portland, Ore., declared a riot after demonstrators smashed store windows and broke into the Multnomah County Justice Center, where office cubicles were set ablaze. “ENOUGH!” Mayor Ted Wheeler wrote on Twitter before declaring a state of emergency and instituting an overnight curfew. Portland’s mayor declared a state of emergency for Portland after riots damaged numerous businesses and public buildings Friday night. A curfew begins at 8 p.m. and continues until 6 a.m. CIVIL RIGHTS ATTY: DEMS NOT STANDING UP AGAINST CRIME IN FLOYD PROTESTS BECAUSE THEY’RE AFRAID TO ALIENATE BLACK VOTE Los Angeles, Calif. Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) Protests in Los Angeles began two days after Floyd’s death, with dozens temporarily blocking Highway 101. The demonstrations turned violent in the days after. On Saturday morning, police worked to disperse crowds in downtown Los Angeles as multiple businesses were looted. Hundreds were reportedly arrested, and at least five police officers were injured, multiple media outlets reported. The Target store at Seventh and Figueroa streets, a Rite Aid store at 7th and Hope streets, along with the 6th Street Market and the Starbucks on Sixth Street between Broadway and Main Street and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway were among the businesses looted just before midnight Friday. Police set up skirmish lines throughout the downtown area and, in at least one instance, fired non-lethal ammunition as they pushed a crowd out of the area, some in the crowd stopping to hide behind vehicles to throw objects at officers. A person answering the phone at the Metropolitan Detention Center could not give an exact number of arrests, but stated it was a “busload.” LOS ANGELES PROTEST ERUPTS OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH; AMERICAN FLAG BURNED, HWY 101 BLOCKED Memphis, Tenn. Mayor Jim Strickland (D) For the third straight day, protesters took to the streets of Memphis to speak out against police brutality and the recent deaths of three African Americans at the hands of police. The first demonstrators arrived just before 6:30 p.m. Within an hour, the crowd had grown to about 300, the largest of the protests so far. That was despite a series of road closures set up by the Memphis Police Department at every entrance into the area. While Wednesday, the overarching emotion seems to be anger, Friday night’s protest seemed to be about unity and healing. Chicago, Illinois Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot (D) Dozens of protesters wearing face masks — many with the communist group Revolution Club Chicago and the organization Refuse Fascism Now, which is calling for President Donald Trump’s removal — gathered in downtown Chicago and marched through the streets for hours Friday evening. The group chanted “say his name, George Floyd” and “black lives matter.” Some held signs that said “Justice 4 George” and “I can’t breathe.” At one point, the group blocked a major highway, stopping traffic as police created a barricade with their bicycles. Later on, the group stopped outside the Metropolitan Correctional Center and chanted “we love you,” according to videos posted to social media. The peaceful protest took a turn early Saturday morning, with demonstrators breaking the windows of several downtown storefronts. Multiple people were arrested, police said. Illinois State Police assisted Chicago police “with several crowds of protesters” from Friday evening to 4 a.m. Saturday, according to the agency. State police did not make any arrests, the agency said. More than 10,000 people had expressed interest in a Facebook event page for a Saturday afternoon protest in Chicago, organized by Black Lives Matter. CHICAGO MAYOR TELLS TRUMP ‘F-U’ AFTER TWEET ABOUT MINNEAPOLIS LOOTING Atlanta, Georgia Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) A state of emergency was declared in Atlanta hours after hundreds of protests converged outside CNN’s downtown headquarters late Friday. Activists spray-painted a large CNN logo outside the building, broke a window, and tagged doors. Protesters pelted officers who came over with bottles, striking some of them. Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used an accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said: “This is not a protest … this is chaos.” Earlier, as the protest appeared calmer, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) Angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, sparking a lockdown at the White House Friday night. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. The protesters have moved from the White House to another part of the city. Multiple reporters posted that they were inside the White House and that the Secret Service was not letting them leave the grounds during the lockdown. In Lafayette Park, the angry group of protests appeared to turn its rage on a Fox News crew early Saturday, chasing and pummeling reporter Leland Vittert and his crew. They were punched and hit by projectiles as they fled. President Trump on Saturday praised the Secret Service for its protection of the White House on Friday night, calling them “very cool & very professional” — and warned that any protesters who breached the fence would have met by “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons.” Denver, Colo. Mayor Michael Hancock (D) Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called for calm and unity Friday after the first of several planned city protests over Floyd’s death turned violent, declaring, “Let not the story be about the riots and protests. Let’s keep the focus on the life that was lost.” “I can tell you not to go out and demonstrate but the reality is it’s going to happen,” Hancock said at a news briefing, stressing he shared outrage over what he’s called the “senseless and tragic murder” of Floyd in Minneapolis. Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen blamed what they called a minority of agitators among peaceful protesters for inciting violence throughout downtown on Thursday. That violence included throwing rocks at police officers, setting small fires, and breaking windows and damaging cars at the state Capitol and at businesses. More protests were planned for Friday and Saturday. Pazen said three officers were injured and that 13 people were arrested for burglary, criminal mischief, and assault. DE BLASIO PROMISES ‘INDEPENDENT REVIEW’ AFTER ANTI-COP RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY New York, N.Y. Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) Demonstrators took to New York City streets for a second day in protest of Floyd’s death and invoked the names of other black people who died at police hands. Demonstrators gathered in Manhattan’s Foley Square and outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn Friday. Some protesters set fire to a police van in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene neighborhood, according to police officials Dozens of people had been arrested as of 11 p.m. Friday, the officials said, adding that more arrests may have occurred. The officials said officers and protesters may have been injured. In Manhattan, hundreds of protesters descended on Foley Square, chanting “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace!” The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, killed on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he stood with the Minnesota protesters. “Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes. And the demand is for justice,” Cuomo said. Windermere, Fla. Mayor Jim O’Brien A group of about 10 protesters gathered Friday near a home that belongs to Chauvin, the police charged with killing Floyd, after social media postings listed an address in the community of Windermere outside Orlando. They carried signs that said, “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George,” and “We see you, we hear you … we love you! #Justice for George.” The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted from its official account that Chauvin is not at the residence and is not expected there. The office says it’s confirmed he has no plans to be in the area. Albuquerque, N.M. Mayor Tim Keller (D) Albuquerque police used a helicopter and tear gas Friday as they retreated from a crowd of people after a confrontation that followed a protest. Police said officers responded to several shots being fired from a vehicle following a demonstration that had lasted hours. Four individuals were taken into custody, and several protesters became confrontational, police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said. During the confrontation, protesters waved signs and yelled at officers clad in riot gear. Gallegos said Friday the tear gas was used to allow officers to leave the area and avoid further confrontation. There were no reports of injuries from the gunshots, and it wasn’t clear whether that incident was related to the protest. Gallegos also said there were no injuries resulting from the confrontation with protesters. Fontana, Calif. Mayor Acquanetta Warren (R) Nine people were arrested after rocks were thrown at businesses, vehicles, and officers during a Southern California protest stemming from the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. The violence erupted Thursday night in Fontana as about 100 people moved up and down a thoroughfare and blocked traffic. Police say an unlawful assembly was declared and the crowd was ordered to disperse but some persisted. Elsewhere in the region, demonstrators gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters but there was no repeat of Wednesday evening’s action in which protesters blocked freeway traffic and attacked two Highway Patrol cruisers. Columbus, Ohio Mayor Andrew J. Ginther (D) Five people were arrested and two police officers were injured by protesters throwing rocks and bricks at them on the second straight night of protests in Ohio’s capital city. Police also reported broken windows and spray-paint graffiti in the Short North. Business owners boarded up their buildings, and a couple stood outside well after midnight, with guns, to protect their properties. Protesters converged earlier in the night on Columbus Police headquarters, where they staged a peaceful protest. Houston, TX Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) On Friday, several thousand people attended a rally in front of city hall in Houston, where Floyd grew up. The rally was mostly peaceful but police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. The crowd marched through downtown Houston to get to city hall, blocking traffic and at times chanting “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” Many held up signs that said, “I Can’t Breathe” and “Justice For George.” Eventually, the protesters ended up alongside U.S. Highway 59, one of the major thoroughfares in Houston. A group of about 60 to 70 shut down the freeway for at least half an hour. Houston police accompanied the protesters as they marched for less than half a mile along the freeway before they walked off of it. No arrests were made. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said he welcomed the rally. “We stand with them protesting what happened in Minnesota,” said Acevedo. “I’m happy that they’re here today because people need to be heard, voices need to be heard.” One of those protesting Floyd’s death was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Phoenix, Ariz. Mayor Kate Gallego (D) Hundreds rallied in downtown Phoenix marching from Phoenix City Hall to the state Capitol on Thursday night into Friday morning carried signs reading, “Silence is violence” and “Being black should not be a death sentence,” The Arizona Republic reported. Around 11 p.m. Friday, Phoenix police declared an unlawful assembly around the Capitol building. Protesters refused to leave the area, news outlets reported. The newspaper reported that rocks and water bottles were thrown at police. Video from local TV stations shows protesters hammering on the window of a police car, and the newspaper reported at least one police car window was broken. The Arizona Department of Public Safety and Phoenix police responded by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets at the crowd. FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE OFFICER KILLED, ANOTHER INJURED IN OAKLAND SHOOTING AMID GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS Louisville, Kentucky Mayor Greg Fischer (D) Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville, Floyd’s mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early Friday. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven people shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others, and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” St. Louis, Missouri Mayor Lyda Krewson (D) Demonstrators in St. Louis stopped traffic and, in some cases, lashed out violently at the police and National Guard to protest Floyd’s killing. A man reportedly was dragged and killed by a FedEx truck early Saturday after protesters blocked off a downtown street with their cars. They were seen setting something in the road on fire when the truck approached. Las Vegas, Nevada Mayor Carolyn Goodman (I) More than 400 people demonstrated on the Las Vegas Strip on Friday afternoon calling for policing reforms. Oakland, California Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) Thousands of protesters descended on Oakland to protest Floyd’s death. A Target store was broken into, a Mercedes Benz dealership was vandalized and set on fire, and other cars were tagged, according to KRON 4. Oakland police said some 60 looters were detained, 22 arrests were made, 13 officers were injured, and 2 Federal Protective Service officers were shot, one of whom died.",0.0

Demonstrators gathered in Monument Circle Friday afternoon to protest the deaths of 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month, 26-year-old Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville and most recently 46-year-old George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. But as night fell, the protests turned violent. At least 30 businesses were damaged. A drugstore was set ablaze. Some stores were looted. ""What took place last night and early this morning did remarkable and senseless damage to businesses and residential properties that will take millions to rebuild and restore,"" said Sherry Seiwert, president and CEO of Downtown Indy Inc., a nonprofit that develops, manages and markets Downtown Indianapolis. She said the cost estimate was based on a figure determined at one business and then projected for the other properties. The protest started peacefully on Friday. But tensions escalated after officers in riot gear arrived, which spurred clashes, vandalism and looting. Many protesters left. By early Saturday morning, some of those who remained threw rocks through storefront and office windows, set fire to trash cans and looted retailers such as TJ Maxx, CVS and T-Mobile. Seiwert said the violence affected businesses and properties across Downtown. Volunteers and workers spent Saturday morning boarding up vandalized properties and cleaning up shattered glass. ""What is most devastating is that the businesses targeted with destruction and looting are the very businesses seeking to lift up racial inequities by employing men and women of all races and minorities — but will now be closed for weeks, months and perhaps forever,"" Seiwert said. Downtown is home to apartment and townhouse dwellers, major corporations, government offices, hotels, small businesses, restaurants and national retailers. The unrest comes as Indianapolis, and the nation, also combats the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans. Governments, including Indiana, issued stay-at-home orders and shut down nonessential businesses in mid-March to stem the spread of the disease. As in other cities, the mandates hurt businesses financially, and the local economy nearly ground to a halt. Downtown restaurants and businesses reopened at limited capacity earlier this month only to be damaged during the unrest. George Stergiopoulos, minority owner of Giorgio's Pizza on East Market Street, said his business, located just off of Monument Circle, was somewhat lucky. A scooter thrown at the restaurant cracked a window pane, but it did not give way, saving Stergiopoulos additional repair costs and preventing the restaurant from shutting down again. He doesn't know whether his insurance will cover the repairs or whether he will have to pay for them himself. He estimates a window replacement could cost $1,000 to $1,500, excluding the cost of labor and materials. ""Here we are with having to spend additional monies that we don't have because we're all cash-poor because of the pandemic,"" he said. The pizzeria turned to delivery and takeout service during the pandemic, shutting only for 16 days before reopening three weeks ago. Stergiopoulos and majority-owner Elif Ozdemir were preparing to resume dine-in service at 50% capacity on Monday, per the city's coronavirus-related mandates. The damage to the business may push those plans back to at least Wednesday. ""There was aggression. We can't understand why that aggression was turned on us,"" Stergiopoulos said, adding that he didn't have problems with the protest. He thought a peaceful protest might even yield additional business. ""Did we deserve this?"" he asked. As more protests were set to take place Downtown on Saturday, Seiwert and Downtown Indy Inc. called on business and community leaders of all races to demand an end to violence. ""We also call upon these same leaders to seek to understand the pent-up anger existing in minority communities and speak out against injustice and inequality and make systemic changes where appropriate,"" Seiwert said. ""Peaceful protests are acceptable and welcome but not when they lead to destruction of property and violence towards fellow humans."" Indy Chamber President and CEO Michael Huber also condemned the violence and destruction. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change,"" Huber said in a separate statement. ""When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury. Violent acts against fellow citizens and local businesses must not continue."" The threat of violence reverberated beyond Downtown Indianapolis as Simon Property Group closed the Greenwood Park Mall as a precaution at noon Saturday. Simon did not respond to a request for comment. Greenwood Police Department patrol officer and spokeswoman Kortney Burrello said information about possible looting at the mall had been communicated via social media networks. ""We are working with Simon monitoring the situation and monitoring social media as well,"" Burrello said. ""We will respond to any threat or potential threat as needed."" Which businesses were damaged? The following is a list of businesses that had some sort of damage and vandalism, according to Downtown Indy.

The two astronauts are on the SpaceX test flight to the International Space Station scheduled to liftoff Saturday. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely slipped into orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoon just in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the 260-foot rocket’s first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. He and his crewmate batted around a sparkly purple toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. Bridenstine pronounced it “just an amazing day.” SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the launch attempt for the second time in four days. “I’m so proud of the people at NASA, all the people that worked together, public and private. When you see a sight like that it’s incredible,” Trump said after liftoff. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement, Bridenstine said. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

READ MORE: https://bit.ly/3cl7vdY Posted by WISH-TV on Saturday, May 30, 2020 Other state and city leaders released statements regarding the overnight protests. Governor Eric Holcomb Hoosiers have long been people who find solutions to the challenges we face, whether it be in response to a pandemic or to an injustice like the world witnessed so tragically inflicted upon Mr. George Floyd in Minnesota. As I stated yesterday, injuring the innocent in response to an injustice is counterproductive. I’ve asked the Indiana State Police to fully support and make resources available to local communities across our state to ensure our citizens and their property remain safe. In the days ahead, peaceful assembly and clear voices will be important if we are to make progress. Violence and vandalism will set us back in our shared desire to resolve differences. Let us again, each of us, be part of the solution. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett Like so many in Indianapolis, I was horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd. I also recognize that the frustration and anger on display over the last few days isn’t new – it has been felt by communities of color for hundreds of years in a country that has far too often fallen short of providing liberty and justice for all. The systemic racism of our past and present must be acknowledged and addressed. At a successful protest that occurred last night, hundreds of residents did just that, peacefully exercising their right to free speech. Unfortunately, after the organizers of that event ended the protest, a smaller group of individuals abandoned this message of positive change. I am saddened that so many people and businesses were injured in the violence that ensued. While the emotions that fueled this vandalism may be justified, the actions that were taken and the harm that it has caused are simply unacceptable and did nothing to further the cause of progress. Last night’s injuries included three law enforcement officers, as well as an individual who received serious injuries while kicking in glass and was saved when an IMPD officer applied a tourniquet and delivered life-saving care. I also want to recognize the actions of the Indianapolis Fire Department to contain multiple fires that were set, as well as our local media that provided necessary journalism under incredibly difficult circumstances. Our office and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department remain committed to ensuring the safety of peaceful protesters, and I would ask all who speak out in the days that follow to reject the tactics of those who would diminish a movement toward national action into unproductive destruction. U.S. Representative André Carson Black people in this country have been unheard for far too long, despite our pleas to stop the senseless killing of our loved ones. I’m proud that as a community, we are raising our voices in unison against injustice. We must be sure, however, that our advocacy is organized, strategic and yields lasting results — in our community, and across America. Let’s make our voices be heard even louder and clearer at the ballot box this year, to bring about lasting change that saves lives. Downtown Indy The safety and wellbeing of person and property for those who live, work and visit Downtown is Downtown Indy, Inc.’s greatest concern shared by our business members and partners.

Protesters burned businesses in Minneapolis. They smashed police cars and windows in Atlanta, broke into police headquarters in Portland, Oregon, and chanted curses at President Donald Trump outside the White House. Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. Faith leaders say they are concerned by the violence, calling for peace. “I’m concerned we have all this damage to the businesses downtown. All of us are supportive, unarmed black men. Where it crosses the line, hurts the message of the cause,” Reverend Charles Harrison said. Rev. Harrison says there has been a historical problem in the country dealing with the issue of race. He says there is pent up frustration. While he knows the frustration, as he was born during segregation, protestors can’t lose the moral high ground. “Where it crosses the line is where it goes into violence, looting and criminal activity. I think it hurts the cause and the message of the cause,” Rev. Harrison said. “I would say, not just to the people here in Indianapolis but those across the country, continue to protest but do it peacefully and continue to speak out against what your cause is. Is it a just cause, is it a good cause but please don’t let it get to the looting and destruction of businesses.” The latest protests were sparked after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Officer Derek Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder.

He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. Police nationwide remain on high alert Saturday, fearing additional unrest. In Indiana, another protest is planned for Saturday afternoon. On Saturday, Downtown Indianapolis released a statement, responding to the violence and destruction that happened in the wake of an initially peaceful protest. The safety and wellbeing of person and property for those who live, work and visit Downtown is Downtown Indy, Inc.’s greatest concern shared by our business members and partners. What took place last night and early this morning did remarkable and senseless damage to businesses and residential properties that will take millions to rebuild and restore. What is most devastating is that the businesses targeted with destruction and looting are the very businesses seeking to lift up racial inequities by employing men and women of all races and minorities – but will now be closed for weeks, months and perhaps forever. Downtown Indy, Inc. calls on all business and community leaders of all races to demand an end to illegal and dangerous behaviors that have riddled our urban core. We also call upon these same leaders to seek to understand the pent-up anger existing in minority communities and speak out against injustice and inequality and make systemic changes where appropriate. Peaceful protests are acceptable and welcome, but not when they lead to destruction of property and violence towards fellow humans.Sherry Seiwert, president and CEO, Downtown Indy, Inc.

The ad comes amid violent protests across the country after George Floyd, a black man, died while in Minneapolis police custody. The white officer seen on video holding his knee to Floyd's neck has now been charged with murder. The ad replaces Nike's standard ""Just Do It"" with a message that starts ""For once, Don't Do it."" Placed over somber music, the ad is simply white text over a black background -- with a clear message. ""For once, Don't Do It. Don't pretend there's not a problem in America. Don't turn your back on racism. Don't accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don't make any more excuses. Don't think this doesn't affect you. Don't sit back and be silent. Don't think you can't be part of the change. Let's all be part of the change."" This is not the first time Nike has taken a stance on social issues. It made news in 2018 with the surprise move of signing Colin Kaepernick to an endorsement deal. Kaepernick created controversy when he started kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games to protest racial injustice. He has not been on an NFL roster since 2016. RELATED: Colin Kaepernick to help provide legal assistance to Minneapolis protesters RELATED: Colin Kaepernick Nike ad wins Emmy for outstanding commercial Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Chauvin was fired. On Friday, he was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, a criminal complaint said. An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death.",0.0

We urge Governor Holcomb to issue an immediate executive order to immediately ban law enforcement from using chokehold restraints, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. This order must include specific repercussions officers will face for violating this ban. If there is no action by the governor, we urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish a local policy that outlaws the use of a chokehold restraint, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. Additionally, we urge these entities to immediately implement the use of body cameras for all patrol officers and require them to be on at all times. If not, a penalty should be assessed. We urge the governor to immediately establish a Statewide Criminal Justice Commission, including a diverse appointing of civilian representatives from the cities with significant African American populations, to examine every aspect of our state’s criminal justice system and recommend comprehensive criminal justice reform, including the eradication of racist policing policies. We expect these recommendations to become bills that get passed in the 2021 Legislative Session. We urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish local Independent Civilian Review Boards, with members selected by local community activist groups, to review public complaints of police violence. 1:00 p.m. - Mayor Joe Hogsett and IMPD Chief Randal Taylor are providing a public safety update.

Here are some of he actions he is taking: Signed Executive Order 20-29 to lift restrictions on local declarations of emergency that had been instituted as a part of the stay at home and back on track orders pertaining to COVID-19. This order, effective as of 11 a.m. today, allows local governments to place more stringent travel restrictions than the state has in place. A link to the order may be found at: https://www.in.gov/gov/files/Executive%20Order%2020-29.pdf. Directed members of the Indiana National Guard to be on standby to assist communities across the state, if requested. Gov. Holcomb verbally activated the Indiana National Guard Reactionary Force company to be available to assist local communities Saturday, however no deployment was requested. Several hundred Guard members remain on standby. Ordered members of the Guard, supported by Indiana State Police, to establish a presence at state properties in Indianapolis to protect them from further damage. “At my order, the Indiana National Guard stands ready to assist local communities in need to protect the public and property, and I am deploying Guard members to protect state property beginning today,” said Gov. Holcomb. “Organized protests have taken place across the state without incident but the events that have followed, particularly in Indianapolis, have devastated businesses, defaced public monuments that are centuries old, and resulted in loss of life.” 2 p.m. - Faith leaders are holding a protest in Indianapolis with a list of demands and a call for justice after the police custody death of George Floyd. 12:30 p.m. - IMPD said it will make several announcements and advise people to leave once the curfew goes into effect.

At the City-County-Building, IMPD said an organized group in one of the smaller protests began trying to damage windows at the CCB. IMPD said the violence and agression of the group turned the protest into a riot. Rocks and fireworks were thrown at officers and began damaging police vehicles. Police then used pepper balls to begin dispersing the crowd and made some arrests. No officers were injured at that point. IMPD said the violence then turned to vandalism, looting, fires and ultimately a number of shootings and two homicides. Officers were not able to respond as quickly as they wanted to because of having to secure areas because of the violence. IMPD said that firefighters and IEMS had rocks and other items thrown at them as well as they responded.

(WTWO/WAWV) — Over 50 protesters gathered Saturday afternoon near the Terre Haute Police Department to protest the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on his neck Monday. His death sparked protests across the country this week. Chauvin and three other officers involved were fired following Floyd’s death, and Chauvin was charged with murder Friday. Protest organizer, Erick Beverly, said it’s his reason for protesting is simple. “I’m out here for Minneapolis. I’m out here for all the innocent black men, women and children that have lost their lives due to corrupt officers that are out here that are supposed to protect and serve us,” he said. Protesters brought signs and chanted sayings like “I can’t breathe,” “Black lives matter,” and “No justice, no peace,” while marching back and forth from the THPD headquarters to the Vigo Co. Courthouse. Beverly said the community’s support meant a lot to him and he hopes his efforts will lead to change in the future. “I believe there’s power in numbers. No matter the color of your skin, as long as you have the same intentions and want to do something for a good cause, we’ll be able to work it out,” Beverly said.

(WPTA21) - Police dressed in riot gear have deployed tear gas at a crowd of protesters who blocked traffic at Clinton and Main street downtown. Protesters lined the sidewalks along Clinton Street and congregated in the Allen County Courthouse green at 2 p.m. Once demonstrators began to block traffic closer to 5 p.m., police in a tactical vehicle used a loud speaker to warn protesters to get out of the street or face arrest. Protesters started to scatter, but then filled the street again stopping traffic. That's when law enforcement fired tear gas into the crowd. Our cameras captured people running from the smoke, and some people tossed tear gas canisters back at police. Now, police in riot gear are lining Berry Street as the protesters are backed into the line of buildings there. Police are using a loud speaker for a second time to tell people to leave the area immediately or face arrest. This is a developing story. Check back in for updates. View previous story below: Hours after city leaders and police asked for peace, demonstrators have again filled the sidewalks around the Allen County courthouse for a second day of protests. Friday evening, organizers planned an ""I Can't Breathe"" protest at the Allen County Courthouse green to demand justice for George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. The white officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes is now facing murder charges in his death. Police and protesters clashed Friday evening, with tear gas being deployed. Windows were broken and many businesses nearby suffered damage. Overnight, 29 people were arrested, and two officers were injured. On Saturday, demonstrators are again at the sidewalk along Clinton Street. The event began at 2 p.m. It's not clear when the demonstrations will end. The Allen County Sheriff's Department has a line of officers and squad cars close to the front courthouse. There is a heavy police presence downtown, and Berry Street is blocked off. So far, traffic is still moving along Clinton Street. ABC has one crew live on Facebook, and another crew live within the crowd that you can watch on our website. This is a developing story. Check back in for updates.",0.0

Pike football coach Pat Echeverria posted on his Twitter account Friday: “I’m a husband, father, & football coach. I’m not political & I’ve never protested. As a coach I’ve tried to use football as an avenue to help young men come together as a group to accomplish things they couldn’t do on their own. Recently we have seen appalling racial injustices across our country & I guess my eyes are finally open to it. I can’t sit back & be silent anymore. It’s hard to believe people are capable of committing terrible & unjust acts but it’s clear our system is flawed. The only way these injustices can be stopped is if the white people stand & show support. I guess the best thing I can do is let my friends, colleagues & players know I’m here to support them & say I believe Black Lives Matter. Hopefully together we can make change that we couldn’t do alone. If you choose to protest, do it safely & peacefully.” Several other coaches posted similar messages including Ben Davis football coach Jason Simmons and Carmel football coach John Hebert. Simmons wrote: “I grew up the son of a police officer. He was hard working, proud guy that treated people with respect and dignity for 19.5 years serving Indianapolis. He had friends and co-workers of all colors that did the same. It’s hard for me to tell our players and students to treat people the right way, be willing to outwork people and good things will happen to you. Unfortunately, that’s not a guarantee in this world. My mind, the last few days, has centered on the training of officers and how we can change the narrative in the ‘land of the free and home of the brave.’ We can’t sit back and be reactionary to this problem. There is a deeper issue of understanding, respect, and cultural awareness that fails exist in persons of power. I will always have the backs of our players, the GIANTS I’m fortunate to work with, and the people I have been blessed to call friends and family over the years.” Cathedral basketball coach Jason Delaney posted on his Twitter account: “As I watch what is going on in our country right now I am saddened by the injustice, division, & how there is a clear difference in how people are treated based on the color of their skin. One thing that keeps playing in my mind is if I stay silent then I let down the current & former players that I coached and assistant coaches from past & present, & the many great friends & people who have impacted my life who are African-American. Those bonds & relationships are what have made this career so worthwhile & meaningful. As a white man I will never understand how this feels but I can work with others to try to bring change and stand up for what is right. I challenged our players two years ago to ‘be the change in the world that you want to see.’ If each of us use our platform and work within our communities to make a difference then I pray we can have meaningful conversations & bring positive changes.” Morristown basketball coach Scott McClelland posted, in part: “I’ve had the privilege of being a part of many different circles of people that have included some very powerful & influential people of all races, religions, and genders. All of these people have made me better and I’ve been fortunate to have learned from them. … To all of my African-American brothers & sisters but more importantly my FRIENDS that have so positively impacted my life … I just want to say thank you! As I finish this I would be remiss that I didn’t say how proud to say that my own family has its own beautiful share of diversity … my wonderful Asian wife, and our beautiful Hispanic daughter.

Floyd, a black man, died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck, sparking protests across the country. ""As a Christian taught to love my neighbor as myself, my heart hurts,"" Jordan posted on Twitter. ""As a black man who's walking in this country every day, my heart hurts. As a father who couldn't imagine losing a child in this manner, my heart hurts. ""And as a coach who never wants this to happen to one of the young men I'm leading and helping learn to lead, my heart hurts. ""George Floyd's murder was senseless. Watching it makes me angry & makes my heart hurt. I pray for the Floyd family & so many other families that have gone through this. Justice needs to be served."" Jordan said he did not know all the answers but wants to help find them. ""We ALL need to own the issues of systemic racism & address the issues,"" he said. ""We ALL need to be active in helping work toward solutions. We ALL need to work toward change from where we are. We ALL need to educate better. ""We ALL need to have crucial & meaningful conversations at home, at work, at school and wherever else we can."" Jordan is one of five black basketball coaches in the Big East, a much higher percentage than in other major conferences. He often posts scripture on his Twitter account. In closing, he posted a Bible verse from Luke 12:35: Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning. Another black Butler basketball coach, assistant Omar Lowery, posted earlier in the week: ""This could have been my son or any of our players that I love as sons. It's because of them that I refuse to believe that we live in a world where change is not possible. Let's continue to fight for justice and love one another regardless of what one looks like."" Barry Collier is the athletic director who recruited Jordan as a player and hired him as head coach. On Saturday, Collier tweeted: ""I am sickened and outraged by the callous murder of George Floyd. This act was inhumane and I stand with all who seek justice. Far too often we see such malevolent acts. Every person deserves respect, not only in thought, but in word and followed by action."" The Boston Celtics' Gordon Hayward, a former Butler and Brownsburg High School star, also posted on his Twitter account: ""What happened to George Floyd is unacceptable and disgusting beyond words. What the officer did should be punished to the fullest extent. How in the world can someone like this be hired to serve and protect us! Praying for George Floyd's family and for all ppl impacted by this and police brutality. ""We cannot grow as a society until we eliminate all forms of racism against any race. Our focus every day should be on supporting each other and showing love for each other. Destroying people's hard work and dreams by burning down their businesses is not the solution. ""We need to protect each other, not tear each other apart. We need change and we need to do it together!"" Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly also spoke out, posting a statement reading: ""Enough! Senseless loss of life, violence, unrest and continued racial injustice. My voice should have been heard earlier, but I was at a loss for words. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the Floyd family and all those affected by prior injustice. I lend my support to be a solution and stand with all those committed to change."" Former Butler player Jordan Tucker posted a statement as well, asking people to support the Minneapolis Freedom Fund and other organizations connected to Black Lives Matter, as well as protest safely. ""I pray these times get better, our message is heard, we create meaningful change and receive justice for all wrong that has been done against us all — each and every one of us,"" Tucker wrote in part. ""Sending you much love and prayers and asking, please be aware and make an impact as best as possible for yourself and those around you."" Ronald Nored, another former Butler player, said one of his best friends is a white police officer. ""We've had real, deep discussions about race,"" Nored wrote. ""He (and my other white friends) asked questions to see how I'm feeling and to better understand all this from someone who is black. ""... I don't have all the answers, but know this, change begins in the way my best friend approached it -- with empathy to understand and having real conversations."" Former Colt Gary Brackett asked for suggestions on how to mobilize in a better way, writing, ""I'm all ears at this point."" Indiana University football coach Tom Allen added his voice to the chorus as well. ""My heart is broken by what is going on in our country,"" he said in a tweet. Racial injustice is wrong and it MUST be addressed!! I Believe we are to LOVE EACH OTHER! No matter one's skin color. Love is a choice. Our prayers are with George Floyd's family."" That was soon followed by a statement from Purdue basketball coach Matt Painter. ""Events of the past few days and weeks have again shown us that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to race and racism in this country,"" Painter said. ""Personally, I am angered and saddened by these events. As the head coach of a college basketball program, I believe it's part of my job to help our players be positive forces in the world once they leave Purdue. I believe it's important that we all work to see the world through the eyes of others and truly hear and learn from each other as we work to create a country where everyone is treated equally. We will continue to do our very best to learn from each other and to lead, teach and educate all members of our current team and the Purdue Basketball Family. ""I will never know what it is like to move through this world as a black person in America, and I can't pretend to know what the answers are. What I do know is that I want to be part of the solution and I believe that the adversity and prejudice that black people in America face is something we must all address and seek to remedy — together.""

Saw it with my own eyes. Blue skies and alabaster clouds, puffy like balls of cotton. Below all that heaven? Signs of the hell that had broken out the night before, late Friday, after what started in downtown Indianapolis as a peaceful protest of that tragedy in Minneapolis – police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder in the death of George Floyd – turned violent. More:What we know about the Indianapolis protest that turned violent Windows are gone in businesses along Washington Street, between Pennsylvania and Meridian. Boarding companies are downtown in their vans and trucks, moving from storefront to storefront, installing plywood where once there were glass windows. The Windsor Jewelry Co., “since 1919,” it says on the sign above the entrance, now greets pedestrians with a huge piece of plywood. Protesters left alone the Five Guys burger joint on Washington Street, but Gallery 42 next door wasn’t so lucky; a plastic tarp spans its storefront window. As of 11 a.m. on Saturday morning, most of the damaged windows hadn’t been addressed yet. There are explosions of anger written on these windows, holes punched out by rock or brick, some windows left intact but ruined still by whatever hit it, leaving behind a single point of trauma that spiderwebs in every direction. The sun rose above Indianapolis on Saturday morning, but look closer at those clouds. See the dark lining? We could be in for more rain. ‘Why are you crying?’ A little girl wants to know why I’m crying, and I don’t know what to say. It’s about 9:30 a.m. Saturday. The morning had started with coffee and oatmeal and whatever passes for sports news on ESPN’s SportsCenter. Finally, you reach for the phone. Check Twitter. See what happened to your city overnight. Feel the rage, the frustration, the outright helplessness that fueled the protests in Indianapolis, protests that started Friday afternoon at Monument Circle because of the death of George Floyd in Minnesota on Monday, and the death of Dreasjon Reed here in Indianapolis following a police pursuit on May 6. How do you not cry? And what do you tell the little girl? She’s 10, and innocent in the best of ways. This little girl responded to the coronavirus outbreak in March by using colored markers to write, “There Is Hope!” and about her neighborhood, “Chatham Arch is Strong!” She put those pieces of paper in her window. Neighbors walking by, they saw the signs. They know the girl, because she’s one of those magnetic kids everyone seems to know. They asked her if she’d make a sign for their house. Her signs hang in the windows of close to 50 houses now. This little girl just finished fourth grade at an urban IPS elementary, Center for Inquiry School 2. She has kids over for sleepovers, three or four girls at a time. She’s the only white kid in the house. What do you tell someone like that? What do you tell yourself? What happened in Minneapolis on Monday makes no sense. An officer identified as Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of George Floyd, who was accused of passing a phony $20 bill. With a crowd watching, with a video camera recording, with George straining and saying, “I can’t breathe,” Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. For the final three minutes, George wasn’t straining any more. He wasn’t talking. Wasn’t breathing. Dead, at age 46. Because, allegedly, of a phony $20 bill. And dead because, definitely, of a society that is broken in ways that seem impossible after all we’ve been through. Slavery and the Civil War. Brown vs. Board of Education and James Meredith. Birmingham and Watts, Emmett Till and Martin Luther King, Reginald Denny and Rodney King and O.J. Simpson. And on and on, the racial divide closing enough for us to elect Barack Obama, then opening back up again as we elected Donald Trump. The President thinks black NFL players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired. “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now!” he yelled in 2017. America was listening. The divide grew. More:Doyel: Colts players explain why they kneel for national anthem Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, tweeted on Friday a condemnation of the protests that were erupting in Minneapolis, but closed his tweet with this rainbow of hope: “We will always stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest and let their voices be heard.” Interestingly enough, Pence was at Lucas Oil Stadium on Oct. 8, 2017, when players for the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts knelt during the anthem. The vice president of our country, a beautiful democracy underpinned by the First Amendment, chose to “stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest” by rising from his seat and leaving. Later he tweeted: “I will not dignify” that particular peaceful protest. America was watching. The divide grew. More:Doyel: Vice President uses Colts for political purposes This country is not safe right now. The racial divide has never been gone, not for one blessed minute, but the volatility grows every day. For years America has felt unstable, a chemical compound waiting for one more bad element to cause an explosion. And there’s Derek Chauvin, kneeling on George Floyd’s neck on Monday in Minneapolis. Floyd is saying: “I can’t breathe.” And then he goes quiet. Ignorance, not privilege She wants to know why I’m crying, and it’s just too big a question. How do I explain what is happening in our country – in our city – to this innocent little girl? She’ll never understand. Truth be told, I don’t understand either. Somebody like me, born into a white middle-class family – we didn’t have the white picket fence, but by God we had the Volvo – cannot begin to understand the frustration in the African-American community. Unless you’re in that community, neither can someone like you. I’m not talking about white privilege, but white ignorance. Literally, none of us knows what it is like to be black in America, to see on the news that another black man has been killed by another white police officer, or that a black quarterback in the prime of his solid career cannot get a job or even a legitimate tryout because NFL teams are terrified of what Colin Kaepernick’s presence on their roster would do to their ticket sales. Looting isn’t right. Throwing bricks into the windows of the CVS after hours, then darting inside and making out with baskets full of stolen goods, is not right. It’s criminal, and it’s patently unfair. What did the owner of Wei Ramen, unfortunately located at 36 E. Washington St., do to deserve that hole in the front window? The window next to it was left unscathed, which is good. It means we can see the reminder of the coronavirus pandemic: Closed, the sign says of the dining room. What happened to Wei Ramen and the CVS and Gallery 42 and the Circle Centre Mall on Friday night was terribly, frighteningly, brutally unfairly wrong. But the anger and frustration that fueled the looting here – and in Portland and Atlanta and Brooklyn and other spots in America – aren’t comprehensible to many of us. We are watching an expression of generations of pain. In some cases, for sure, we are watching agitators, anarchists just wanting to see the world burn. In other cities, protesters are coming from out of town. Is that happening in Indianapolis? If so, what are you doing there? What is anyone doing there? What do I tell the 10-year-old girl? Stay home, I tell her. More protests are scheduled for Saturday. They will start peacefully, but eventually the sun will go down. And I don’t like the looks of those clouds in the distance. I don’t like it at all. Find IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel.",0.0

Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. This marks NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission has unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits.

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year. (The Associated Press contributed to this report)",0.0

What started as mostly peaceful protests at the beginning of the week has turned into chaos. City leaders have pleaded with communities to voice their outrage in a lawful manner, but the widespread escalation of protests continued Friday night into Saturday. Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, one of the four officers at the scene who were all fired. The Department of Justice has said a full investigation of the incident is a “top priority.” Prosecutors said Chauvin, who was the officer seen in video pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck, had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd was unresponsive for two minutes and 53 seconds of the encounter. This story will be updated as protests continue throughout the country. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern. 3:00 p.m.: 533 arrests, 6 police officers injured in Los Angeles Six police officers were injured and 533 people were arrested during protests throughout Los Angeles, California, Friday and early Saturday morning, police said. The hundreds of arrested were charged with burglary, looting, probation violations, battery on a police officer, attempted murder and failure to disperse, police said. All but 18 of the arrested have been released on their own recognizance. The officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries ranging from lacerations to impact wounds. “While more protests are slated for various locations throughout the city today, we remain hopeful those demonstrations will be peaceful. The Department will be deploying additional resources to maintain order and ensure the safety and security of not only individuals exercising their first amendment rights but also the residents and businesses in our community,” said Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michael Moore. 2:15 p.m.: Attorney General Barr comments on ‘radical’ protests Attorney General William Barr warned protesters with ANTIFA and radical ties that they are committing a federal crime. “Peaceful protests are being drowned out by violent radical elements,” said Barr at a brief press conference on Saturday. Barr noted that there are people with what he called, ‘ANTIFA-like tactics,’ who are traveling from outside of the area, to participate in protests coordinated as peaceful demonstrations. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that they are investigating whether outsiders, including white supremacists, are inciting riots. “It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate” in these violent crimes, said Barr. 1:56 p.m.: Public safety alert issued for Ohio The Columbus Ohio Police Department issued an emergency alert on Saturday afternoon urging people to stay out of the downtown area for their “safety and the safety of others.” The alert comes a day after at least five people were arrested, five officers were injured and several businesses were destroyed during protests, WSYX-TV reported.  1:35 p.m.: Atlanta’s mayor denounces protests that turned to ‘destruction’ “What we saw overnight was not a protest, and it was not Atlanta … We know our citizens are angry. We are angry and we want justice,” said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms in a statement on Saturday. Friday night’s protest in Atlanta, Georgia, started out as “a peaceful demonstration, quickly turned into mayhem and unnecessary destruction, and ultimately an assault on businesses that are already struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Lance Bottoms. The protests were a result of the most recent police-involved killings of African Americans across the country as well as the murder of Ahmaud Arbery who was shot while jogging on Feb. 23 in Satilla Shores, Georgia. The city’s Department of Public Works have been cleaning up the streets, the Department of Transportation is removing graffiti and the National Guard has been contacted for assistance in order to “help our city recover,” said Lance Bottoms. “If we are to enact change in this nation, I implore everyone to channel their anger and sorrow into something more meaningful and effective through non-violent activism,” said Lance Bottoms. 1:16 p.m.: A federal officer died, another injured in California One Federal Protective Service officer has died, and another was wounded Friday night, the FBI said in a statement to ABC News. As an arm of the Department of Homeland Security., FPS officers are responsible for protecting federal buildings across the country. A car pulled up to the building and started firing, according to the FBI. The agency doesn’t say if the incident was related to protests in the city. 22 people were arrested during demonstrations in the Oakland Friday night, according to authorities. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to ABC News’ request for comment 12:18 p.m.: A mayor in Mississippi faces backlash for ‘breathe’ comments The mayor of Petal, Mississippi, is facing backlash and calls for him to resign after justifying former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for keeping his knee on George Floyd’s neck. “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing,” Mayor Hal Marx wrote on his now deactivated Twitter account on May 26 — the same day Chauvin was seen on a 10-minute video kneeling on Floyd. Similar remarks were made after former NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo was seen on video using an alleged unauthorized chokehold to allegedly kill Eric Garner in 2014. Garner’s last words, “I can’t breathe” became a national rallying cry against police violence. Marx defended his remarks on Twitter, and his deactivated Facebook page as misinterpretations. The Petal Board of Aldermen held a special meeting on Thursday, voting unanimously to ask for Marx’s resignation, The Clarion Ledger reported. Marx has refused to step aside.  10:58 a.m.: NYPD arrested over 200 during protests Demonstrations throughout New York City Friday night resulted in the arrest of over 200, including one person in Brooklyn who had a loaded gun and a woman who was armed with a lit Molotov cocktail. More than 3000 demonstrators gathered in Foley Square and outside Barclays Center, police said. At the height of the protests, 37 patrol cars were vandalized with graffiti and broken windows, a police van was set on fire and a Molotov cocktail was thrown into an occupied police car — the officers inside were not hurt. There were more than a dozen officers injured, ranging from teeth knocked out to shoulder and head injuries. 10:47 a.m.: 1,000 more National Guard service members activated in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced on Saturday morning that an additional thousand members of the National Guard will be deployed to “support civil authorities” during protests over the murder of George Floyd. “Our communities of color, our business community were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses it took a decade to build,” said Walz during a press conference Saturday morning. Protests turned violent with fires set across the city, objects were thrown at the police and dozens have been arrested, officials said. Over 700 soldiers and air service members’ duty were activated overnight. What’s happening in the city is in “no way about the murder of George Floyd it’s about attacking civil society and installing fear,” said Walz. “We cannot as members of the community tolerate that,” said Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington at a press conference on Saturday. Officials said only about 20% of the rioters are Minnesota residents. Walz noted that practicing First Amendment rights should also involve practicing COVID-19 guidelines, but “the folks that are gathering out there … the masks were worn to disguise, to cause confusion and take advantage of that situation.” “The Minnesota National Guard is prepared to protect life, protect property and restore order,” according to a press release by the state’s National Guard. 9:24 a.m.: FBI director calls George Floyd investigation “a top priority” ABC News has obtained a message to FBI employees sent by FBI Director Chris Wray, on Friday. In it, Wray said the investigation into the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death “is a top priority, and experienced prosecutors and FBI agents have been assigned to the matter.” He said the investigation “will determine whether the actions by the former Minneapolis police officers involved in this incident violated federal law.” He also wrote about how damaging the failure to honor the rights of citizens, particularly those in custody, can be. “Law enforcement officers have indispensable and often dangerous jobs, but that doesn’t diminish the crucial, overarching role we play in society – to protect and serve all citizens no matter their race, creed, orientation, or station in life. This, of course, includes those citizens who are in law enforcement custody,” Wray said. “When we fail to honor their rights, we not only tarnish the badge we wear, we completely erode the trust so many of us in law enforcement work so hard to build, particularly within minority communities. The events this past week in Minneapolis clearly illustrate just how quickly that trust can be lost,” the message stated.” 8:41 a.m.: White House protesters would have been met with “most vicious dogs,” “most ominous weapons,” president tweets President Trump fired off a series of tweets Saturday morning praising the Secret Service after protesters marched in front of the White House Friday night. “They were not only totally professional, but very cool,” he president tweeted. “They let the “protesters” scream & rant as much as they wanted…” he wrote. The president also wrote that if protestors had become “too frisky” or “got out of line,” “they would quickly come down on them,” he wrote. He also tweeted that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would have been “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” He also took a jab at D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. “On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice!,” the president tweeted. 8:19 a.m.: FBI issues statement on Oakland shooting The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a statement after one person was killed, and another injured in a shooting at that took place while protests were happening in Oakland, California. FBI San Francisco and Oakland police are investigating, but it is unknown yet if the shooting is connected to the protest. “FBI San Francisco and the Oakland Police Department are investigating a shooting that occurred at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at 1301 Clay Street in Oakland, California.,” the statement read. “At approximately 9:45pm on Friday, May 29, 2020, a vehicle approached the building. An individual inside the vehicle began firing gunshots at contract security officers for the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security. One officer was killed and another was injured,” according to the statement. “The FBI has deployed investigators and the Evidence Response Team to the crime scene. We will continue to work this investigation alongside the Oakland Police Department,” the statement continued. 7:24 a.m.: Portland mayor declares State of Emergency Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced Saturday morning that he’s declaring a State of Emergency in the city following the destructive unrest in the wake of the death of Floyd. He also announced the city has a curfew in effect until 6 a.m. local time Saturday and will begin again at 8 p.m. “Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything,” Wheeler said in a statement Saturday. “This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting.” Overnight the Portland Police Department declared the protest as a riot after “significant vandalism” was reported and a fire was set inside the city’s Justice Center. Police said there was also a shooting connected to the protest. Police said large sections of downtown were closed and that protesters should “disperse now or you will be subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal.” 5:43 a.m.: 1 dead in Detroit after person opens fire on protesters from vehicle One person is dead in Detroit after a vehicle drove up on people protesting the death of Floyd and opened fire, according to authorities. A gray Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, hitting a 19-year-old man who later died at the hospital, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson told ABC affiliate WXYZ. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the violence and destruction overnight is not what the city of Detroit is about. “This does not represent the vast major of Detroiters who came here to make a statement,” Craig said during a press conference Friday night. “We support the message, but let’s do it peacefully.” He said many of the people taunting police officers and trying to incite violence have come from outside the city to sow chaos. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city. They are not from this city,” Craig said. “Let’s peacefully protest, but outside of that, we’re not going to tolerate it. We’re not going to tolerate criminal acts.” 4:26 a.m.: ‘Prudent’ to have Army units ready to deploy to Minnesota, governor says As fires raged and protests escalated even further throughout Minneapolis Saturday morning, local and state officials said getting the chaos under control will take a response never before seen in the state because “there’s simply more of them than us.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at least 1,000 additional Minnesota National Guard troops would be activated Saturday, and even then, that might not be enough. “You may have seen or heard that, this evening, the president directed the Pentagon to put units of United States Army on alert to possible operation in Minneapolis,” Maj. General John Jensen, Adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard, said during a press conference Saturday. “While we were not consulted with, as it relates to that, I do believe it’s a prudent move to provide other options available for the governor, if the governor elects to use those resources.” Walz said it’s more complicated than just saying yes and deploying them now because the move to have federal troops patrolling in Minneapolis would be something never before seen in the state. “I spoke with President Trump the other night, I think it is prudent to have them ready for us to exhaust all resources that we need,” Walz said Saturday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Walz angrily took to the podium Saturday morning to ask those setting fires, attacking officers and looting businesses to stop. “We as a city can be so much better than this,” Frey said at the press conference Saturday. “There is no honor in burning down your city. There is no pride in looting local businesses that have become institutions of a neighborhood.” He said people, especially during a pandemic, are counting on grocery stores being open to get groceries, pharmacies to get needed medicine and banks to get money. “If you care about your community, you got to put this to an end; it needs to stop,” Frey said. Walz said the tragedy of Floyd’s death has morphed into “an unprecedented threat to our state,” where those causing destruction have no regard to property or life. Dozens of arrests were made on Friday, but an official total has not been released for the city. In one instance, shots were fired at law enforcement officers overnight. 1:48 a.m.: Shots fired at law enforecment officers in Minnesota Shots were fired at law enforcement officers in Minneapolis early Saturday morning near the police department’s Fifth Precinct, according to Minnesota State Police. No officers are believed to have been hit. Following the shots, authorities warned residents to leave the area immediately or they would be arrested. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said there are 350 officers and troopers in the area and “officers have arrested several people who ignored multiple dispersal orders.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz pleaded with protesters overnight to go home. “Minnesotans, please go home. It’s time to restore peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,” Walz said in a statement. “The situation has become dangerous for Minnesotans and first responders.” Protesters took over the Minnesota Police Department’s Third Precinct building late Thursday night and ignited several fires. 12:58 a.m.: LAPD asks residents to stay inside, businesses to close in downtown LA The Los Angeles Police Department has asked downtown Los Angeles residents to stay inside and for all businesses to close due to the escalating protests in the city. “We have declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown LA,” the department said in a statement Friday. The areas impacted are from the 10 Freeway to the 101 Highway and the 110 Freeway to Alameda. “This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage,” LAPD said. “Those on the street are to leave the area.” The department previously asked people to avoid downtown Los Angeles Friday, including nearby side streets and freeways. 12:27 a.m.: Georgia issues State of Emergency, activates National Guard Georgia Gov.

The protest outside Barclays Center, the home of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, began peacefully, but drew what police sources described as professional agitators and turned ugly. There were more than 100 protesters detained outside the arena, mainly for throwing bottles and other disturbances. Protesters moved toward two police precincts in northern Brooklyn, the 88th Precinct in Fort Green and the 79th Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Along the way, a police van was set on fire and several cruisers were defaced with graffiti and broken windows. Some 500 demonstrators massed outside the 88 Precinct, where the van was set on fire. There were about 40 arrests there. Some demonstrators made it inside the 79 Precinct but were immediately arrested There have been about a dozen officers hurt so far in clashes with the protesters. 9:21 p.m.: Atlanta sees violence spark outside CNN A protest in Atlanta grew violent this evening as a handful of protesters began smashing the doors to CNN Headquarters just after 8 p.m., according to Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB. After defacing the outside of the news network’s HQ and lighting a police car on fire, protesters began throwing objects at police who are inside the building’s lobby. Police were holding a line with shields. “Above everything else, I am a mother. I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a press conference Friday night. “When i saw the murder of George Floyd I hurt like a mother would hurt. And yesterday when I heard about rumors of violent protests in Atlanta, I did what a mother would do, I called my son and said, ‘Where are you?’ I cannot protect you and black boys should not be out today.” “So you’re not gonna out-concern me or out-care about where we are in America,” she added. “I wear this each and every day and I pray over my children each and every day.” 8:19 p.m.: Protest outside White House draws Secret Service  A protest this evening in Lafayette Park just north of the White House has drawn the assistance of the Secret Service.

Terrific people. And we’ll be reporting as time goes by. We think that we’ll also have to make the statement,” Trump said. “It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory — let it be a perfect memory.” The president also took the chance to emphasize peaceful protests, following controversial tweets earlier Friday in which he said “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” “It’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights for peaceful protesters. We can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well,” the president said. “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters.” 4:21 p.m.: Minneapolis, St. Paul enforce curfew Gov. Tim Walz has said a curfew will be in place starting Friday night from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Saturday in the entire Twin Cities region. No one will be allowed in the streets in public except for first responders and media. The curfew will also be in place Saturday night at 8 p.m. to Sunday 6 a.m. “It’s time to rebuild our community and that starts with safety in our streets,” Walz said in a statement. “Thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their grief and frustration in a peaceful manner. But the unlawful and dangerous actions of others, under the cover of darkness, has caused irreversible pain and damage to our community. This behavior has compromised the safety of bystanders, businesses, lawful demonstrators, and first responders. Now, we come together to restore the peace.” Officers will arrest those who do not comply, Walz said. Earlier, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had already issued a curfew order for the city for the same times. 3:40 p.m.: Prosecutors reveal more details about charges on former officer The Hennepin County Attorney released the full criminal complaint for former officer Derek Chauvin. The 44-year-old officer who was filmed putting his knee on Floyd’s neck faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for third-degree murder charges and a maximum of 10 years behind bars for manslaughter charges. “Derek Michael Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd by his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and taking a chance of causing death or great bodily harm to George Floyd,” the complaint read. “The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” according to the complaint. 3:07 p.m.: Floyd’s family responds to former officer’s arrest  While they said they were pleased with that he was apprehended, they said they expected first-degree murder charges. “We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,” they said in a statement. The family also asked for the remaining three officers to be arrested and charged. 2:28 p.m.: Trump tweets against looting President Trump again doubled down on his earlier remarks about the ongoing protests. He tweeted again that “looting leads to shooting” citing “what just happened with 7 people shot.” In Minneapolis. “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means,” he tweeted 2:26 p.m.: Bill Barr releases statement on Floyd death Attorney General Bill Barr said the Department of Justice and FBI are conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated in George Floyd’s death. “The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,” he said in a statement. Barr said the state’s charging decisions will be made first. 1:22 p.m.: Officer arrested in connection with Floyd’s death Derek Chauvin, one of the four former officers fired for their involvement in George Floyd’s death, has been taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is scheduled to give a news conference on developments in the case at 2 p.m.  1:09 p.m.: Cops warn of anarchists infiltrating protests ABC News obtained a police bulletin issued to the Philadelphia Police Department and the Delaware Valley Intelligence Center that warned that anarchists and other groups are calling on their supporters to commit acts of violence against police officers in light of the protests in Minneapolis. The bulletin said there have been several social media posts calling for looting and civil disobedience as well as other acts of violence. “Domestic extremists, including anarchist extremists and other anti-government extremists, are using the unrest in Minneapolis to amplify and justify their calls for dismantling law enforcement agencies and carrying out attacks on law enforcement, government, and capitalist targets,” the bulletin said. The bulletin stressed that non-violent protests are legal and protected by the Constitution. “Anarchist extremists may be attracted to this call to action and engage in direct action against law enforcement property, such as buildings and vehicles, in order to draw attention to their cause,” it said.  12:56 p.m.: Obama offers statement on George Floyd of our darkest chapters’ Former President Barack Obama issued a statement on social media about Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests in Minneapolis. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” he wrote. “It can’t be ‘normal.’ If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.” Obama said it is up to Minnesota officials to ensure that Floyd’s death is fully investigated and justice is ultimately done, however, he encouraged people “to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”  12:40 p.m.: Governor calls on order to be restored after ‘one of our darkest chapters’ Gov. Tim Walz called the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests that took place have been “one of our darkest chapters.” However, he said he refused to let those who caused destruction to Minneapolis “take away the attention of the stain that we need to be working on” and pleaded with the community to help restore order. Walz said that the “looting and recklessness” that occurred was not caused by those who wanted justice for Floyd. “We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues,” the governor said, later calling one of the issues “fundamental institutional racism.” He said that he would not “patronize” the black community as a white man, but asked the community to “help us use a humane way to get the streets back to a place where we can restore justice.” Walz started off his press conference by acknowledging generations of pain and anguish that communities of color in America have experienced. He said that those communities have not been truly heard, “much like we failed to hear George Floyd as he pleaded for his life, as the world watched, by the people sworn to protect him, his community, our state.” The commissioner for the state’s Department of Public Safety called Floyd’s death “murder.” “That’s what it looked like to me,” Commissioner John Harrington said. His comment marked the first time a member of law enforcement call Floyd’s death murder publicly. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison began his remarks by quoting Martin Luther King Jr., saying “riot is the way that the unheart get heard.” He said King urged people not to dismiss non-peaceful protests or relegate it as criminality, but ask what was really going on there. Ellison said that protesters should not react to the National Guard in the way that may react to the Minneapolis Police Department. He noted they are two different agencies and “their job is trying to bring peace and calm back again.” Ellison said that although people continue to ask when justice will be served, he believes authorities understand that “the wheels of justice must turn swiftly.” He also said that while the investigation and criminal procedure for this case is important, it by no means addresses the root of these problems in this country. “I think we’re gonna do some real change. … We’re not just gonna fix the windows and sweep up the glass. We’re gonna fix the broken, shattered society that leaves so many behind.” 11:10 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights. Jenkins said that the anger of the community has been expressed and she did not want further action to lead to injuries or loss of life. “We can’t allow this type of civic unrest to continue,” she said. Jenkins on Thursday called on city officials to declare racism a public health crisis. “By declaring racism a public health emergency it provides us the opportunity to name the virus that has infected our American institutions for centuries but in addition, it gives us the opportunities to … you can’t really begin to cure a disease until you know what that disease is,” she said. “It’s an infectious disease just like the coronavirus and it’s not just Minneapolis.” 11 a.m.: Trump says National Guard is in Minneapolis President Donald Trump tweeted that the National Guard is now in Minneapolis. “They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared,” the president wrote. “George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!” The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Photos showed members of the National Guard in the streets of Minneapolis. Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Thursday activating the Minnesota National Guard after Wednesday night’s destructive protests. 10:50 pm.: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden said he was “furious” over President Donald Trump’s tweet on the protests “I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too,” Biden wrote. Trump tweeted in the early morning hours of Friday that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” referring to the protests. He also called protesters “thugs.” Enough. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 29, 2020 Biden said that he will be speaking more later today about the situation in Minneapolis. He also addressed a CNN crew being arrested. “This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything,” Biden said, with the swift action appearing to refer to their release. 10:20 a.m.: Melania Trump says there is ‘no reason for violence’ First Lady Melania Trump said the nation needs to focus on healing and “there is no reason for violence.” “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she tweeted. “I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now.” Trump also offered her “deepest condolences” to Floyd’s family. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing,” the first lady wrote.  Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 29, 2020 10:09 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights.

It won’t be easy, but it’s essential,” Crump wrote on Twitter. If only I were surprised by this hypocrisy. Minneapolis PD arrests journalists but not murderers from within its own ranks. These problems will require systematic change to start the healing process. It won’t be easy, but it’s essential. https://t.co/2wC3qxLWFT — Benjamin Crump, Esq. (@AttorneyCrump) May 29, 2020 6:59 a.m.: CNN reporter, crew arrested live on air CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his production crew were arrested in Minneapolis live on air Friday morning while reporting on the Floyd protests. The news outlet is reporting that police said they were arrested because they were told to move and didn’t. “A CNN reporter & his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves – a clear violation of their First Amendment rights,” CNN said in a statement Friday morning. “The authorities in Minnesota, incl. the Governor, must release the 3 CNN employees immediately.” Minnesota State Sen. Jeff Hayden phoned into CNN and said he just had a joint text with the governor and mayor and that they were just trying to get control of the area and weren’t aware of the CNN reporter getting arrested. “Hoping that we can figure it out,” Hayden said. 6:44 a.m.: 70 arrested or summonsed in New York City during George Floyd protests At least 70 people were arrested or summonsed during a series of protests that started in Union Square and spread through Lower Manhattan through Thursday night. Most will be summonsed for obstruction of governmental administration and social distancing violations, but there will also be assault and weapon possession charges. The protest began in Union Square after 3 p.m., Thursday but after that broke up, protests reemerged at Foley Square courthouses, City Hall and Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest, and moved toward the West Side Highway. Several police officers were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one with a possible concussion. One person was arrested for assaulting a police officer for throwing a garbage can into a crowd and striking a police officer in the head. Another person attempted to grab the service weapon from a Deputy Inspector’s holster. That person will be charged with robbery. 1:15 a.m.: Trump says military could assume control in city, ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’ President Donald Trump weighed in on the destructive protests in Minneapolis early Friday morning, saying the military could “assume control” of the response. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also attacked Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying the protests are a result of a lack of leadership. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right,” Trump tweeted. Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying it’s weakness to point fingers during times of crisis. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” 12:48 a.m.: Minneapolis asks residents to ‘retreat’ over precinct explosion possibility After people protesting George Floyd’s death forcibly took over a Minneapolis precinct and began to ignite fires, city officials are now warning residents to leave the area in case the building explodes. “We’re hearing unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the Third Precinct have been cut and other explosive materials are in the building,” the city tweeted. “If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes.” Frey said residents must clear the area so the fire department can put out fires. “We are working with @MinneapolisFire to deliver resources and respond for a beloved neighborhood in our city,” Frey tweeted. “We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.” The Minnesota National Guard has been activated for the area and said it’s helping the fire department safely get to fires to help them battle the blazes. Since the protests started, the Saint Paul Police Department said more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted. Despite the destruction, with dozens of fires set, authorities said there are no reports of serious injuries. “Calm on the horizon,” the department said late Thursday night. 12:32 a.m.: Governor ‘shocked’ after vehicle attempts to run over protester Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is “absolutely shocked” by video of a car attempting to run over a person protesting the death of Floyd in Denver on Thursday. What started as a peaceful protest turned chaotic with reports of vandalism and violence. “Tonight is a very sad night for our state. While we are still uncovering all of the facts, a protest regarding the killing of George Floyd devolved into vandalism and violence, and I was absolutely shocked by video evidence of a motorist attempting to run over a protestor,” Polis tweeted. “Coloradans are better than this. I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” Previously shots were fired across the street from Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver. 11:51 p.m.: Protesters gain access to police precinct  People protesting the death of Floyd have reportedly taken over the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct and set it on fire, according to authorities. Minneapolis Police spokesperson John Elder said staff was evacuated from the building around 10 p.m. local time and that protesters forcibly entered the building and ignited several fires. Shortly after reports of the precinct takeover, the Minnesota National Guard said it was deploying more than 500 soldiers to the area. “We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,” the National Guard said in a statement. “Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls.” 9:20 p.m.: Colorado protest marred by gunshots Protesters outside Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver received a scare when someone apparently fired shots nearby, causing the assembled group to flee. There were no injuries, authorities confirmed to ABC News. “Officers on scene at W Colfax Ave and W 15 st on shots fired in the area of the Capital. This is an ongoing investigation and the motive is unknown,” Denver police wrote on Twitter. Leslie Herod, who is a state representative, tweeted about the incident as well. She added that someone was apprehended, though police have not confirmed any arrests. The Capitol was put on lockdown, with Herod, who fled inside included. Herod told an ABC News producer she was not scared by the incident. “No. This only makes me more resolved. We have more work to do,” she said. 8:31 p.m.: 911 call released The 911 call made by the store owner who accused Floyd of using fraudulent money was released by authorities Thursday evening. According to the transcript of the call released by the state of Minnesota, the caller — a store owner — told the operator that Floyd entered the store drunk and tried to pay for something with “fake bills.” He later left the shop and sat on his car. It was there where police found him when they arrived at the scene. “Someone comes [to] our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was [sic] sitting on their car,” the caller said. “We tell them to give us their phone, put their… thing back and everything, and he was also drunk and everything and return to give us our cigarettes back and so he can, so he can go home but he doesn’t want to do that, and he’s sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” The operator then asked the caller for Floyd’s race and sex. “No, he’s a black guy,” the caller replied. “Alright,” the operator said, letting out a sigh according to the transcript, before the caller asked, “How is your day going?” 6:25 p.m.: Investigation is ‘top priority’ for DOJ The Department of Justice has made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority,” Erica MacDonald, attorney for state of Minnesota, said at a press conference. MacDonald said President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr are “directly and actively” monitoring the case. “It is critical, it is essential, it is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time,” she said. “And that is what we are going to do.” No federal or state charges against the officers were announced at the press conference. Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman asked for “patience.” “Give us the time to do this right and we will bring you justice — I promise,” Freeman said. He said his office has been flooded with calls on the status of the investigation. The main question, he said, has been, “what’re you gonna do about the murder of George Floyd?” “We are going to investigate as thoroughly as justice demands,” Freeman said. He called the officer’s action “excessive and wrong,” but said he needs to determine if it was criminal. Both MacDonald and Freeman called on the public to come forward with any information they may have. There was a delay in starting the press conference, which MacDonald apologized for and said she was hoping to share a development but that it was not the right time. 5:35 p.m.: City releases complaint history of 4 officers The police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was involved in 18 complaints prior to being fired, according to records released by the city. Derek Chauvin, who was fired following Floyd’s death, was only disciplined for two of those complaints, according to the city records. The documents do not provide the details of the complaints or the disciplines. Tou Thao, who was the officer seen standing up in the video, had six complaints, one of which remains open, according to the records. Thao, who was also fired, was not disciplined for the other five complaints. The other two officers who were fired, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, have had no complaints. 5:15 p.m.: Governor signs executive order activating National Guard Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard following Wednesday night’s protests. Walz said the purpose of the National Guard was “to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.” “The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,” he said in a statement. “While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved.” The National Guard Adjutant General will work with local government agencies to provide personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to respond to and recover from the protests, according to Walz’s office. There will also be about 200 members of the Minnesota State Patrol that will work with state, county, and local community and public safety partners. State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft on the ground will assist law enforcement officers, the governor’s office said. 5:03 p.m.: Families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery issue joint statement The families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery — all of whom died after incidents with current and former law enforcement — are demanding change and calling for government action to address this “national crisis.” “We’re devastated about the senseless violence that has broken the hearts of our families,” the families said in a joint statement. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive. This is a national crisis and our government needs to take immediate and widespread action to protect our black and brown communities.” The families have called for a congressional hearing and a national task force to create new bipartisan legislation that is aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability. They will also present a case to United Nation Human Rights Committee for sweeping changes to the nation’s criminal justice system. A date for when they would be presenting their case was not provided. Taylor, a black woman, was a front-line worker who died after a police-involved shooting. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping inside their Springfield Drive apartment on March 13 when officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department attempted to execute a “no-knock” search warrant. Three plainclothes officers opened Taylor’s front door and “blindly” opened fire into their apartment, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in April by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Taylor was shot at least eight times and died. Arbery, a black man, was out for a jog when two white men saw him and set off to confront him, police said. The men, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, were armed. A video shows Arbery and Travis McMichael tussling with the shotgun before three shots are fired. Arbery stumbled and fell to the ground, where he was pronounced dead. City leaders react to protests The mayor, police chief and city council vice president in Minneapolis emotionally addressed the violent protests that took place Wednesday night over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point became choked up and tearful, said that the protests were “the result of so much built up anger and sadness.” “Anger and sadness that has been engrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years,” Frey said at a press conference. “If you’re feeling that sadness and anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he knew that there was a “deficit of hope” in the community and that his department has contributed to that deficit. He also said that the violence and destruction seen in Wednesday night’s protest was mostly caused by a “core group of people” who were not from Minnesota. He said that most of the community members who have been protesting since Floyd’s death Monday have been peaceful. Arradondo said he wanted to ensure that people could safely protest, but he said he could not allow for criminal acts. Wednesday night’s protest caused destruction and chaos in Minneapolis, including a deadly shooting, looting and multiple fires. The protests, which had been largely peaceful up until Wednesday night, were in wake of Floyd’s death after he was apprehended by Minneapolis police Monday. Disturbing video emerged on social media showing a police officer with his knee on the man’s neck as the man repeatedly yells out, “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe, please, the knee in my neck,” the man said in a video showing a police officer pinning him to the ground. “I can’t move … my neck … I’m through, I’m through.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins sang “Amazing Grace” at Thursday’s press conference before addressing the protests. Jenkins said she wanted to offer “amazing grace” and her condolences to the Floyd family. “We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks, a knee that says black lives do not matter,” Jenkins, who is black, said. “I am part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks.” Jenkins, Frey and Arradondo said they would be working with the community leaders. A “healing space” will be created at the 3rd Precinct in Minneapolis for residents to express their concerns and anger in a safe and humane way, Jenkins said. Overnight developments Police said during the protests they responded to a call of a stabbing victim and found a man in grave condition near the protests. The man later died in the hospital and authorities learned he died from a gunshot wound, according to John Elder, the director of communication for Minneapolis police. One person was in custody after the shooting, police said. It was not immediately clear what led to the shooting, but the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the owner of a pawn shop opened fire on a man he believed was burglarizing his business and fatally shot him. Police said multiple businesses were looted during the protests and the city’s fire department said there were 30 intentional fires during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires. Massive flames were seen in the sky on videos that circulated throughout social media. As of Thursday afternoon, the fire department said crews were still extinguishing fires along East Lake Street. People were also throwing rocks at fire department vehicles responding to the scene, according to the fire department, which noted there were no firefighter injuries. Elder had said people were throwing rocks at firefighters. Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, wrote on Twitter the family thanked the protesters and wanted peace in Minneapolis, but “knows that Black people want peace in their souls — and until we get #JusticeForFloyd there will be no peace.” “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors and endanger each other as we respond to the necessary urge to raise our voices in unison and in outrage,” Crump wrote Thursday morning. “Looting and violence distract from strength of our collective voice.” Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 — Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 28, 2020 The city requested assistance from the National Guard late Wednesday during the protests, according to ABC Saint Paul affiliate KSTP. The National Guard did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment. “Tonight was a different night of protesting. Last night we had 8,000 protestors all peaceful. Tonight we did not have that,” Elder said. Elder said that there were no serious injuries to officers. He was not sure about the number of people arrested. The fire department said there were no civilian injuries from the fires. Gov. Tim Walz urged people to leave the area as the situation escalated. “The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone’s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene,” Walz wrote on Twitter. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also asked people to evacuate the area. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” Frey wrote on Twitter. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing Floyd’s death. On Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office were conducting a “robust” criminal investigation into his death. “The federal investigation will determine whether the actions by the involved former Minneapolis Police Department officers violated federal law. It is a violation of federal law for an individual acting under color of law to willfully deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” according to a joint statement from United States Attorney Erica MacDonald And FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen. The officers involved in the incident were identified by police as Officer Derek Chauvin, Officer Thomas Lane, Officer Tou Thao and Officer J Alexander Kueng. All four officers were fired, according to Frey. “This is the right call,” the mayor said. The Minneapolis Police Department said Monday that officers were initially called to the scene “on a report of a forgery in progress” in a statement on their website. The statement added that officers were advised that the suspect “appeared to be under the influence” and that he “physically resisted officers.” He later “appeared to be suffering medical distress” and officers called an ambulance. He was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance, “where he died a short time later.” The police department said there were no weapons of any type used by anyone involved in the incident and no officers were injured.

(WOWO): For the second straight day, police fired tear gas at protesters gathered in downtown Fort Wayne to speak out over the death of George Floyd. In a similar scenario to Friday’s events, the demonstration started out peacefully at the Allen County Courthouse lawn and carried on as such for several hours, before demonstrators started to move into the street at Main and Clinton. Police responded in riot gear as tempers flared: At least one reporter was gassed multiple times. Demonstrators could be seen throwing the tear gas canisters back at police, according to our Partners in News at ABC 21. Fort Wayne and Allen County police had promised a swift response to any trouble, in response to Friday night’s protest that became a riot, which led to the arrests of 29 people and damage to nearby vehicles and storefronts. Mayor Tom Henry, Sheriff David Gladieux, and Police Chief Steve Reed all said Friday’s escalation was egged on by non-residents who had allegedly made that their goal. Protesters Saturday chanted “you go home” at police when officers ordered the crowd to disperse and had declared the gathering was no longer lawful. At about 6pm, a second round of tear gas was deployed. As of 9pm, protesters were still active, although police continued to fire tear gas in an effort to prevent large groups from gathering. Stay safe, #FortWayne. The downtown area is a dangerous place to be right now. Lots of gas. @JGfortwayne — David J. Gong (@GongNewsFW) May 31, 2020",0.0

As the death of George Floyd sparked widespread condemnation after disturbing video spread across social media showing a police officer with his knee on Floyd’s neck as he yelled out, “I can’t breathe,” the president remained silent for days on the topic. Trump instead tweeted repeatedly about topics in the news and pushed unfounded claims about mail-in ballots being tied to widespread fraud and continuously promoted a baseless murder conspiracy, despite a widower’s plea, to smear a cable news host. The president first commented on Floyd’s death Wednesday afternoon after being asked by a reporter while touring Kennedy Space Center. He would go on to announced he’d asked the F.B.I. and Justice Department to investigate the incident. But at nearly 1 a.m on Friday, as protests were raging around the country in the wake of another in-custody death of a black man, the president seemingly reverted to a place critics say he often heads; stoking heated tensions and fanning the flames of longstanding racial division. In late-night tweets, which Twitter flagged for “glorifying violence,” the president smeared protesters as “thugs,” threatened to use military force to “assume control,” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” echoing a phrase first used by a Miami police chief that civil rights groups have widely condemned. Trump and the White House have since tried to walk back the comments, claiming the president was not encouraging violence and that the president meant “looting leads to shooting,” saying he didn’t know the phrase’s origins. The president’s campaign in a statement blamed the media, Twitter, and Democrats for “twisting of President Trump’s words… to take the entire nation down the worst road imaginable.” “The facts show that the President expressed horror over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and ordered the Department of Justice to get involved. When riots erupted in that city and elsewhere, he warned on Twitter that looting could quickly turn into violence,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. But, senior Trump campaign advisor Katrina Pierson defended the president’s words on Twitter writing, “There’s no problem standing up to the looters and vandals,” in response to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticizing Trump for suggesting looters should be shot. Trump’s remarks were swiftly condemned by activists and critics claiming Trump’s words suggesting looters should be shot showed a stark difference between how the president responds to civil unrest depending on who’s protesting, pointing to Trump’s tweets from a few weeks back egging on mostly white and some armed conservative groups protesting lockdown measures amid the coronavirus in contrast to his remarks on majority black protesters in Minnesota. “You’re quick to send your troops to kill us?” Leslie Redmond, the head of Minneapolis NAACP said at a press conference on Friday. “You were crying, ‘liberate Minnesota,’ when it came to economics, property, and money. When are you going to tell them to liberate black people in America?” But following a night of civil unrest across the country, the president Saturday morning again threatened violent retaliation against protesters. Hundreds of people gathered outside the White House Friday night to protest Floyd’s killing and the president’s response, and amid boiling conflict Trump took to Twitter and goaded the protesters writing that if the demonstration had escalated, “that’s when people would have been really badly hurt”—threatening to sick the “most vicious dogs” and turn the “most ominous weapons” against them, even seeming to revel in the idea that “many Secret Service agents just waiting for action.” The president also, after threatening to use lethal force if protests escalated, appeared to urge pro-Trump demonstrators to show up to the White House on Saturday night, tweeting: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” A move that many in response have pointed out could lead to escalated tensions. Trump’s comments are the latest example of the president’s tendency to seemingly pour gasoline on flaming racial tensions. In 2017, after the massive white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the president said there is “blame on both sides,” leading to widespread condemnation that he was blustering racist groups. And last summer, Trump told a group of four American congresswomen of color to “go back” to where they came from, a comment that ignited condemnation from Democrats and Republicans. And as protests rage over Floyd’s killing, which many Americans decry as the latest example of police brutality against African Americans, the president’s history of urging law enforcement to use excessive force is facing renewed scrutiny. During a 2017 speech to law enforcement officers, the president urged against protecting the heads of suspected gang members when putting them in police cars. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car, and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put your hand over…I said, ‘You can take the hand away, O.K.?’” Trump’s latest remarks amid tensions in Minneapolis over the death George Floyd come in an election year and while his campaign has heavily invested in an effort to appeal to black voters, with plans to open retail-style stores in black neighborhoods, a multi-million dollar Super Bowl ad buy, and the launch of a “Black Voices for Trump” coalition. “I think this is an opportune time to really show African Americans that they’re trying to engage that they understand the grievances of the overall community, and what not a better time to showcase that than when the community is grieving about injustices,” political strategist Shermichael Singleton told ABC News. And following the president’s lead, the campaign had remained on the sidelines for days as Floyd’s death sparked mass condemnation, including by presumptive Democratic nomniee Joe Biden, and devastated and took an emotional toll on the black community they are working to court. Many on the president’s team began speaking out on Floyd’s death on Thursday amid rising protests across the country and to condemn rioting. “Looting is not protesting. Burning down local homes and businesses is not protesting. How sad that the memory of #GeorgeFloyd has been lost in all of this,” Trump campaign senior advisor Lara Trump tweeted. But as the campaign has worked to hijack the phrase “woke” in an attempt to connect with voters, selling hats, shirts, and hoodies embroidered with the phrase groups like Black Lives Matter worked to popularize, some believe their response in times of racial violence has been anything but socially aware of racial injustice. “Like all Americans, the Trump campaign was shocked and horrified over George Floyd’s death. The campaign and our surrogates have been active in condemning both Floyd’s death and the violent outbursts that have followed it,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, pointing out that “unlike Joe Biden, who has no actual responsibilities, our candidate is the President of the United States, who has responsibility for the Department of Justice. When the President addressed Floyd’s death and quickly thereafter announced the DOJ civil rights investigation, the campaign amplified that action.” The campaign said they issued a statement to reporters on Floyd’s death on Thursday and said “the country is still dealing with this tragedy, it is important for Americans to come together peacefully, call for clear-eyed justice, and unite as one nation.” In contrast, it took moments for the re-election campaign to launch an all-out onslaught to attempt to smear former Vice President Joe Biden as a “racist” after his now infamous Breakfast Club interview, first posted online last Friday. “This is disgusting,” the Trump campaign tweeted less than an hour after the interview appeared on YouTube, along with a clip of Biden telling radio host Charlamagne Tha God that black voters “ain’t black” if they’re still deciding between voting for him or the president. Biden later that same day during a call with the National Black Chamber of Commerce conceded that he was “much too cavalier” in his remarks, and said he did not take the black vote for granted. Still in the hours leading up to that call, the president’s campaign team deployed a full-scale blitz utilizing its massive war chest, organizational might, and “Black Voices for Trump” coalition to try and capitalize on Biden’s comments as part of the Trump campaign’s latest effort to appeal to black voters, a core voting block for the former vice president and Democrats. The Trump team helped push a #YouAintBlack hashtag that trended across Twitter–They dropped a $1 million ad-buy promoting Biden’s comments and labeling him a “racist.” And before noon last Friday, the Trump campaign had scheduled and held a press conference call featuring South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the sole black Republican senator, to blast the presumptive Democratic nominee’s comments. And as thousands took to the streets to demand justice for Floyd, the Trump campaign blasted its “Black Voices for Trump” email list on Wednesday afternoon still highlighting Biden’s comments, asking voters to mobilize behind President Trump. On Friday night, the Trump campaign emailed supporters and the media a list of “what The Trump campaign is saying about the tragic loss of George Floyd,” which featured campaign officials like senior advisor Lara Trump condemning looting. But most Trump campaign officials remained silent regarding the incident until Friday when they issued statements online days later condemning the looting and protests in the wake of Floyd’s death along with condolences. Biden first addressed Floyd’s death in a tweet on Tuesday calling for a “ thorough investigation” and adding “George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.” A day later, Biden again addressed Floyd’s death during a digital event on Wednesday, arguing that the incident–and its similarities to Eric Garner’s case from five years ago which saw a white New York City police officer caused the chokehold death a black man, proved just how much further the country needs to go to root out systemic injustice. “It cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights and in dignity, and it sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat, every single day,” Biden said. Along with touting the landmark criminal justice reform bill the president signed into law in late 2018, Trump had planned to use historically low black unemployment, which began to decline under President Barack Obama as his main pitching point to black voters, but with those numbers skyrocketing amid the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately impacting black and minority communities, his team has switched focus to painting Biden as a racist. Plans for the Trump campaign to open up retail style community centers in several predominantly black cities in battleground states in an effort to pitch minority voters have been put off during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, Trump allies also held independent events in black communities, touting the president’s record and giving away thousands in cash. In 2016, Trump won just 8% of African-American voters. And as the Trump campaign has ramped up efforts to court black voters, advisers say even a marginal increase in support in key battleground states would have a significant impact. “It defies all logic and reason for Donald Trump to try to court black voters while trying to win white votes by calling black people ‘thugs’ and amplifying racial violence,” Yvette Simpson, CEO, Democracy for America and ABC News contributor said. “The Trump campaign’s attempts to win black votes aren’t about serving black people, they’re about distracting the public (and especially white voters) from the image of an incompetent president who used bigotry and racial resentment to fuel his political rise, and who continues to fuel the fire of hate and racism today,” Simpson told ABC News. Darrell Scott, a close ally to President Trump told ABC News discussions are underway to resume those events. Scott, who President Trump called a “very good friend” during a listening session with African American leaders in Michigan this month, serves as the CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump and Urban Revitalization Coalition. He pushed back against accusations the community events, which he called “nonpartisan” are trying to buy the black vote. “To imply that the black community would have a vote to sell or to imply that we thought so less of the black community to entice them with the selling of a vote is offensive,” Scott told ABC News. Scott, who also serves as a co-chair for the “Black Voices for Trump” coalition is one of few campaign officials who spoke out publicly immediately following Floyd’s death. “It’s more than a “Black Rights” issue, it’s a “Human Rights” issue,” Scott stated on Twitter.

Andrew Cuomo on Saturday used social media and his daily coronavirus briefing to lash out against “injustice in the criminal justice system” and called for an end to the violent protests that have taken place in dozens of cities across the United States following the brutal death of George Floyd. Initially, the Democratic governor seemed to link the coronavirus outbreak to inequality and Floyd. “Why are black people dying from #COVID at higher rates than white people? Why are health outcomes worse in communities of color? Why did George Floyd die? Why does this happen again and again? It’s all related,” he waxed over Twitter. About an hour later he tweeted a list of the names of 18 minorities affected by police brutality. “Yes, the names change, but the color doesn’t,” Cuomo tweeted. About 20 minutes later he tweeted again, “You are in denial if you think the death of George Floyd was an isolated incident.” Floyd, 46, died Monday night in Minneapolis while he was in police custody. A cell phone video showed Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, had kneeled on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd gasped for air and begged for his life. Floyd’s death triggered peaceful protests in Minneapolis over police brutality and racial inequality on Tuesday. As the week went on, the demonstrations took an ominous turn and by Friday had turned deadly. Similar protests have taken place in several U.S. cities including Brooklyn, N.Y. At his Friday briefing, Cuomo said he stood with the Minneapolis protesters. “Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes. And the demand is for justice,” he said. That evening, New York police officers purportedly shoved protesters as unruly crowds gathered near the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn. Two sisters from the Catskills who had been in the area were arrested for throwing a Molotov cocktail at an NYPD van Friday night. “It is by the grace of God … that we don’t have dead officers today,” New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news briefing. At his coronavirus briefing on Saturday, Cuomo said New Yorkers had the right to demonstrate but warned they should wear masks while doing so. “You have a right to demonstrate, you have a right to protest — God bless America,” he said. “You don’t have a right to infect other people. You don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Cuomo also expressed confusion at why people disregard “the effectiveness of the mask.” “Demonstrate with a mask on,” he said. “What’s the difference?”",0.0

In Columbus, Ohio, dozens of protesters gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse on Saturday morning, many yelling “I can’t breathe,” “who do you serve?” and “no justice, no peace, no racist police.” While it started largely peaceful, simmering anger quickly bubbled over, quickly getting out of hand. GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: THE CITIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING AND RIOTING Local media reported police deployed tear gas after an officer was hurt in a confrontation with protesters. Images on social media showed police and protesters pouring water on their faces after the tear gas was deployed. A state of emergency was declared soon after. In Tallahassee, Fla., videos shared on social media showed a driver of a red truck running the vehicle into a crowd of protesters on Saturday. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES AND LANGUAGE The Tallahassee Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. In a Facebook post, the city’s mayor confirmed the incident, saying the driver struck the crowd at a “low rate of speed.” “Thankfully no one was seriously injured,” Mayor John Dailey wrote. “The driver of the vehicle was immediately taken into custody. The peaceful protestors have my unwavering support and I unequivocally condemn any violence toward protestors.” Lucas von Hollen, an instructor at Florida State University, said he saw the incident as protesters were chanting and marching as in a standard demonstration, but then he heard a distinct scream of fear. He looked out a window from a second-floor work building and saw the burgundy pickup. He described it slowing down as it had driven up toward the protesters, who didn’t move. “Then the truck revved its engines … a couple people got out of the way, but some people didn’t, and it just drove straight through the crowd.” He said people followed the car to prevent the driver from getting away. FOX NEWS CREW CHASED, ATTACKED BY ANGRY MOB WHILE REPORTING ON PROTESTS OUTSIDE WHITE HOUSE Floyd, 46, was declared dead on Memorial Day hours after he was pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer, later identified as Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on his neck. A video from the incident showed Floyd struggling to breathe. In a video recorded by a bystander, Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. Floyd was pronounced dead Monday night. Four police officers — Chauvin, Tomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng — were fired from the force Tuesday. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in the third degree. Following a fourth-straight day of protests in Minneapolis, Gov. Tim Walz announced he had authorized “full mobilization” of the state’s National Guard — a first in the Guard’s 164-year history. “The tactics and the approach that we have taken have evolved and need to evolve the same way, with a sensitivity to the legitimate rage and anger that came after what the world witnessed in the murder of George Floyd and was manifested in a very healthy gathering of community to memorialize that Tuesday night, which was still present to a certain degree on Wednesday,” he said Saturday. “By Thursday it was nearly gone and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd’s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.” MINNESOTA GOV AUTHORIZES ‘FULL MOBILIZATION’ OF STATE’S NATIONAL GUARD, SAYS PROTESTS NO LONGER ABOUT DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD The anger that seized the nation also comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by a white father and son while out running. In Austin, Texas, hundreds of protests gathered in front of the city’s police headquarters — remaining relatively calm. It was in contrast to an overnight demonstration that saw police officers fire bean bag shots and make several arrests. According to organizers, they were also calling for justice in the shooting death of 42-year-old Mike Ramos, a black and Hispanic man who was shot and killed by Austin officer Christopher Taylor in late April. Protesters were seen climbing onto U.S. Interstate 35 bridge. At least one person was reportedly arrested outside the police department. NIKE RELEASES AD IN WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: ‘FOR ONCE, DON’T DO IT’ Other protests Saturday were seen in New York City, Albany, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Newark and other cities across the country. In Columbia, S.C., protesters gathered peacefully outside Justice Square before marching to the city’s police department headquarters. There, they were met with officers dressed in riot gear, videos posted on Twitter show. In Cincinnati, Mayor John Cranley announced a 10 p.m. curfew Saturday and Sunday in the areas of the city following damage to businesses during protests the night before. Cranley said hundreds of people had demonstrated peacefully, with no major issues before 11 p.m., but those who engaged in criminal activity “were not part of the protest.” Eleven people were arrested and more arrests will come as suspects are identified, he said. Outside one of the damaged buildings, a sign read: “Racism is real. Silence is compliance.” In the city’s Washington Park, a crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and began marching toward City Hall through the streets. Organizers said they didn’t want a repeat of Friday night. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art, hundreds of demonstrators gathered, holding signs and chanting. There was also a gathering at Dilworth Park to kneel silently for nine minutes, as police watched. Hours later, the demonstrations turned violent as police confronted protesters throughout the city.

The protests were held to demand justice for George Floyd, who died while in police custody in Minneapolis. In his statement, Mueller referenced the death of Eric Logan, who was fatally shot in June 2019 by a South Bend Police officer. Mueller released the following statement: “As demonstrations unfold across the nation and here at home against the injustice of George Floyd's death, it's important for us to remember that the right to protest and express ourselves through free speech are foundations of our democracy. I hear the anger and empathize with those who face systemic injustice. Our community is understandably in pain and in search of answers. I will continue to push for more information about the death of Eric Logan. Frustration has compounded over time with change moving too slowly, particularly for our communities of color. Systemic change is not easy. In a democratic society like ours it requires changing hearts and minds. We can't decide what happens in other cities, but we can come together in South Bend and make our city a fairer and more just home for us all. We can listen openly to our neighbors with different experiences and viewpoints and engage each other through the lens of our common humanity. Reforming our public safety systems remains a top priority of my administration. To be successful, this will have to be an inclusive process. Change won't happen overnight, but I'm confident we can overcome whatever challenges we face together.”",0.0

(WANE) The Fort Wayne Police Department issued a media release late Saturday afternoon detailing the chain of events that led up to the use of tear gas to disperse a large group of people who had gathered to protest downtown in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Of the 29 people arrested Friday evening, all but five were from Fort Wayne. The five out of towners were from Galien, Michigan; Niles, Michigan; Sweetster, Indiana; Mishawaka, Indiana and Fremont, Indiana. The following text is take verbatim from the media release: Yesterday evening a protest was scheduled from 5pm to 8pm at the courthouse square in downtown Fort Wayne. For a time, the protest was and remained peaceful. The crowd began spilling into the street around 7pm and at that point 10 Point Coalition was utilized to get people back onto the sidewalk and lawn. However, the crowd became hostile toward them and began making threats to them. The protest then became increasingly aggressive and police intervention began. Police made several announcements to leave the area, to disperse the crowd. The crowd refused. After several attempts and only after the crowd began jumping on cars and then began hurling rocks and water bottles at officers did the Public Safety Response Team deploy smoke and tear gas. Rioting ensued for the duration of the evening until about 2:00am. 29 arrests were made throughout the night mostly for Disorderly Conduct and Failing to Leave an Emergency Area. There were a couple of felony arrest one for Criminal Recklessness and Reckless Driving w/ Property Damage. Two officers were injured, both with minor injuries and a few citizens were reported injured but we do not have information on their injuries. FORT WAYNE POLICE DEPARTMENT",0.0

An end to police brutality. Some kind of fix for hundreds of years of oppression. Those are among the reasons why protesters gathered again in downtown Indianapolis throughout the day Saturday following a night of protests that began peacefully but turned violent and chaotic after the sun went down. In the early afternoon Saturday in front of the Indianapolis Convention Center, a group of roughly 50 people chanted “I can’t breathe,” “Black lives matter” and “ACAB – 1312” – an anti-police reference – as frustration has grown over the police killings of black civilians across the country. Holding a sign that read “I’m an American too,” Indianapolis resident Gregory Holmes-Brown said he hoped the protests made people realize that there is a problem with police brutality in the country. “I hope that there’s reform not just in the criminal justice process but the way that officers are vetted,” he said. “The vetting process for officers at the academy – making sure that we’re getting the right people behind the badge, the right people in uniform. Because a lot of the wrong people have been in uniform for a long time.” David Hennessy said he watched the protests unfold on television and was disappointed — he thought there should be tens of thousands of people. “Then I’m sitting at home, and I said, 'Well, I’m being a hypocrite,'” he said. “So here I am.” As the afternoon began, Malik Muhammad, one protest organizer, asked the white allies to stick with black protesters throughout the day. Black protesters are the ones that are more likely to be harmed, he noted. ""That's why we're here,"" some people responded. Vickie Yaser, Hennnesy's wife, thought it was disappointing that it was considered a big deal that white people were present. ""It’s sad that should be remarked upon that there would be white faces,"" said Yaser, who recalled watching the statement on television. ""There should be everyone's face."" Although some protesters did not condone the violence that erupted downtown Friday night, others could understand the reasons behind the rage. ""I think that a riot comes when voices are often unheard,"" said Matthew Curtner of Carmel, arguing that people of color have been systematically oppressed in this country for way too long. As the evening approached, A.J. Dennis stood with a sign next to police at Monument Circle. As the father of an 18-month-old girl, seeing the Minneapolis death of Floyd, who also had two daughters, struck him personally. ""It really shook me,"" he said. ""This is kind of the last time. This is kind of the last straw."" If he didn't do anything, he said, it would feel like he was not doing justice for all the fathers across the country. ""There's a war now,"" he said. ""There's a race war."" Former NFL football player Colin Kaepernick already tried to start a peaceful protest by kneeling during the national anthem, some protesters noted. That didn't work. ""Now we're just frustrated,"" Dennis said. ""So the rage is what you see across the country."" Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at 317-444-6156. Follow her on Twitter: @hollyvhays.

Floyd’s death and footage of the officer pressing a knee into his neck for several minutes have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement — exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there’s much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. “Progress and change can ebb and flow,” said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week — including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned — “proved to me that we’ve regressed to the point of 2015,” Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis — a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic — has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. “The system itself has not changed,” Armstrong said. “The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.” The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city’s police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union’s president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “We saw his eyes … we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe,” said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin’s arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong. “We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.” Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. “You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.”",0.0

During a news conference Saturday, Hogsett admitted that he does not know the challenges of being a black person in Indianapolis. However, he said he is willing to listen. Hogsett invited organizers of Friday’s protests to meet with his staff and himself Saturday morning along with Dreasjon Reed’s mother and representatives from Black Lives Matter. During that meeting, they discussed several matters, and Hogsett came out with two commitments. To continue to change on major issues related to community policing, transparency, and accountability. Also to the ongoing investigations into May’s police shooting deaths. The mayor’s office and the IMPD remain dedicated to ensuring the safety of peaceful protestors “I am sincerely sorry that so many families in Indianapolis cannot trust their city leaders and authorities,” Hogsett said. “And as we work towards that cause of progress in Indianapolis, including the long-overdue deployment of body-worn cameras and civilian representation on a new use-of-force review board, I pledge that there is more we will do.” Hogsett said while he encourages the loud voices of peaceful protests, the good faith efforts of those protestors are overshadowed by violence. He called for Saturday’s protestors to congregate safely, and return home before dark. Community and faith leaders echoed Hogsett’s sentiments, saying that they understand the pain, but they have to do things the right way. “We don’t want to be stigmatized as the black community for the actions of a few, because we know 99 percent of individuals out here mean well. And we know it wasn’t just members of the black community out here,” Aaron Williams, a community advocate said.

1621176116,2020-05-30 17:14:11,"Before Floyd death, activists saw progress on police reforms",https://fox59.com/news/before-floyd-death-activists-saw-progress-on-police-reforms/,en,True,"politics and government, blacks, police, demonstrations and riots, murders and attempted murders, police brutality and misconduct",89515,fox59.com,http://fox59.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Years of dialogue about police and criminal justice reforms in Minneapolis had improved the relationship between the African American community and law enforcement, activists say — before the police killing this week of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Floyd’s death and footage of the officer pressing a knee into his neck for several minutes have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement — exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there’s much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. “Progress and change can ebb and flow,” said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week — including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned — “proved to me that we’ve regressed to the point of 2015,” Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis — a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic — has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. “The system itself has not changed,” Armstrong said. “The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.” The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city’s police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union’s president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “We saw his eyes … we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe,” said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin’s arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong. “We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.” Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. “You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.”",0.0

We share the Minneapolis community’s wishes to hold these officers accountable for their actions. “However, some of the actions that occurred Friday night in Indianapolis to show solidarity with the Minneapolis community were disheartening. When a peaceful protest descends into a chaotic situation, where certain individuals were determined to damage property, it runs counter to the principles we all hold dear. Violence and vandalism are no way to express or show your support. Our branch disavows and condemns this behavior. This type of behavior does nothing to bring light to inequities in any community. We expect those responsible for this destruction of property to be held to account fully for their actions. The purpose of any peaceful assembly is to bring light to the issue and show respect to the victimized. Damaging property does not serve this purpose. “We must keep our focus on the injustices that the black community lives with every day — lack of access to quality health care and education, a justice system stacked against black men and women, and lack of economic opportunity. We must rally, along with white America and other people of color, to demand that these injustices be fixed. We must create systems that no longer place one class or race of people above another. “Again, we encourage our community to engage in peaceful assemblies of protest and respect the wishes of the Floyd family, being ever mindful in these unprecedented times to maintain social distancing and prevent further spread of the COVID virus that has already harmed so many in our community.” 9:30 p.m. update Police in a statement on Twitter said they dispersed “a crowd at Market and Alabama streets after projectiles were repeatedly thrown at officers and windows were broken at government buildings.” We support our residents’ right to lawful and peaceful protests.

During a news conference Saturday, Hogsett admitted that he does not know the challenges of being a black person in Indianapolis. However, he said he is willing to listen. Hogsett invited organizers of Friday’s protests to meet with his staff and himself Saturday morning along with Dreasjon Reed’s mother and representatives from Black Lives Matter. During that meeting, they discussed several matters, and Hogsett came out with two commitments. To continue to change on major issues related to community policing, transparency, and accountability. Also to the ongoing investigations into May’s police shooting deaths. The mayor’s office and the IMPD remain dedicated to ensuring the safety of peaceful protestors “I am sincerely sorry that so many families in Indianapolis cannot trust their city leaders and authorities,” Hogsett said. “And as we work towards that cause of progress in Indianapolis, including the long-overdue deployment of body-worn cameras and civilian representation on a new use-of-force review board, I pledge that there is more we will do.” Hogsett said while he encourages the loud voices of peaceful protests, the good faith efforts of those protestors are overshadowed by violence. He called for Saturday’s protestors to congregate safely, and return home before dark. Community and faith leaders echoed Hogsett’s sentiments, saying that they understand the pain, but they have to do things the right way. “We don’t want to be stigmatized as the black community for the actions of a few, because we know 99 percent of individuals out here mean well. And we know it wasn’t just members of the black community out here,” Aaron Williams, a community advocate said. Pastor Ronald Covington Sr. from Friendship Missionary Baptist Church intoned Martin Luther King, saying “violence begets violence, and hate begets hate.” Covington says people have the right to protest, but they have to do it peacefully.

Kamala Harris attends protest in front of White House Evgen_Prozhyrko/iStockBy ELLA TORRES, WILLIAM MANSELL, CHRISTINA CARREGA and IVAN PEREIRA, ABC News (MINNEAPOLIS) — The death of George Floyd, a black man who was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died, has caused outrage in the city of Minneapolis and across the United States. What started as mostly peaceful protests at the beginning of the week has turned into chaos. City leaders have pleaded with communities to voice their outrage in a lawful manner, but the widespread escalation of protests continued Friday night into Saturday. Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, one of the four officers at the scene who were all fired. The Department of Justice has said a full investigation of the incident is a “top priority.” Prosecutors said Chauvin, who was the officer seen in video pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck, had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd was unresponsive for two minutes and 53 seconds of the encounter. This story will be updated as protests continue throughout the country. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern.  6:12 p.m.: Sen. Kamala Harris attends protest in front of White House Sen. Kamala Harris joined protesters in front of the White House Saturday afternoon. Harris posted a video to her Twitter of herself in the crowd with people chanting, “Hands up. Don’t shoot.” Harris, who is considered among presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s top choices for vice president, could be seen clapping during the chants. “People are in pain. We must listen,” Harris tweeted. Her communications director, Sabrina Singh, also tweeted that Harris was in attendance. Singh wrote that Harris was “advocating for people to be heard.”  6:06 p.m.: Columbus mayor implements curfew A curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. has been implemented in Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Andrew Ginther said. “We respect, value and welcome the right to protest,” Ginther tweeted. “This curfew is not intended to stifle peaceful protest but to protect our people.” At least six governors — in Minnesota, Ohio, Georgia, Colorado, Wisconsin and Kentucky — have activated the National Guard as protests continue to spread. Most cited keeping the public safe as their reason for doing so.  5:30 p.m.: Majority of people arrested for rioting were from Minnesota, jail records show The majority of those jailed in Minnesota on charges of unlawful assembly, riot and/or damage to property charges were from the state, jail records show. From May 29 to May 30, there were a total of 35 people jailed on those charges. Of those 35 people, only four were from out of state. State and local leaders have stressed that many of the people causing destruction or inciting violence were from out of state. The people arrested not from Minnesota were from Michigan, Missouri, Illinois and Alaska, according to jail records. The jail records only show arrests for the Minneapolis Police Department and don’t include arrests on charges, such as burglary, a charge police said people related to the protests were arrested on. Other agencies, including the St. Paul Police Department, also made arrests. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said everyone arrested in his city last night was from out of town.  4:53 p.m.: Atlanta police prepared to make arrests during protests  The Atlanta Police Department is gearing up to make arrests for any criminal activity following destructive protest throughout the city. The department announced in a press release that it will not tolerate the looting and damage to property that occurred on Friday night and Saturday morning that led to 71 arrests, damage to 20 police vehicles, including two that are total losses, multiple fires, vandalism and other criminal acts as well as a number of businesses that were looted, burglarized or damaged. Atlanta officers, assisted by about 20 local, state and federal agencies, are prepared to monitor activity and protect vulnerable business districts and retail centers. Police Chief Erika Shields said police were “patient” despite three officers suffering minor injuries and hours of getting objects thrown at them, including water bottles, bullets, eggs, rocks, fireworks and knives. “But we will not allow these protests to devolve into the destruction of property or placing the safety or our officers in jeopardy. We will make additional arrests and we are grateful to the assistance we are receiving from our partner agencies,” said Shields. 4:29 p.m.: Denver announces curfew this weekend Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced an 8 p.m. curfew for this weekend. Hancock said the National Guard has been activated by Gov. Jared Polis to help enforce the rule. Essential travel is exempt. These measures come in the wake of two straight nights of intense, and sometimes violent, protests in the city regarding the death of George Floyd. 4:11 p.m.: 2 NY sisters arrested, 1 charged with attempted murder Two sisters from the Catskills, New York, are charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle with four NYPD officers inside near Brooklyn Museum Friday night. Samantha Shader was charged with four counts of attempted murder, attempted arson, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon. Darian Shader was charged with resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration, both misdemeanors. The Shader sisters are awaiting arraignment at Brooklyn Criminal Court on Saturday. If convicted, 27-year-old Samantha Shader faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. Attorney information was not available. 3:52 p.m.: Minneapolis police’s protest plans kept under wraps After 27 arrests, 23 fires and 131 calls to police for shots fired, Minneapolis police have not announced any new plans on how they will handle the ongoing protests any differently. “We are not going to let a group of people hijack this city,” Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Saturday. Arradondo made the promise to residents, but did not share any new tactics his officers will be using tonight to make sure that doesn’t happen. “Over the last 72 hours, so much has been occurring,” said Arrandondo, adding, ‘We were overwhelmed, quite frankly.” Since Thursday evening, there have been widespread violence, destruction and fires throughout the Twin Cities. Over 380 people called to report burglaries, business alarms and damage to property. Arrandondo said they are working with legitimate community groups who are holding peaceful protests in order to help separate those designed to incite violence. Arrandondo seems to be hoping the National Guard will secure areas that have been the site of much of the destruction so MPD officers can go back to answering other calls throughout the community. 3:00 p.m.: 533 arrests, 6 police officers injured in Los Angeles Six police officers were injured and 533 people were arrested during protests throughout Los Angeles, California, Friday and early Saturday morning, police said. The hundreds of arrested were charged with burglary, looting, probation violations, battery on a police officer, attempted murder and failure to disperse, police said. All but 18 of the arrested have been released on their own recognizance. The officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries ranging from lacerations to impact wounds. “While more protests are slated for various locations throughout the city today, we remain hopeful those demonstrations will be peaceful. The Department will be deploying additional resources to maintain order and ensure the safety and security of not only individuals exercising their first amendment rights but also the residents and businesses in our community,” said Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michael Moore. 2:15 p.m.: Attorney General Barr comments on ‘radical’ protests Attorney General William Barr warned protesters with ANTIFA and radical ties that they are committing a federal crime. “Peaceful protests are being drowned out by violent radical elements,” said Barr at a brief press conference on Saturday. Barr noted that there are people with what he called, ‘ANTIFA-like tactics,’ who are traveling from outside of the area, to participate in protests coordinated as peaceful demonstrations. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that they are investigating whether outsiders, including white supremacists, are inciting riots. “It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate” in these violent crimes, said Barr. 1:56 p.m.: Public safety alert issued for Ohio The Columbus Ohio Police Department issued an emergency alert on Saturday afternoon urging people to stay out of the downtown area for their “safety and the safety of others.” The alert comes a day after at least five people were arrested, five officers were injured and several businesses were destroyed during protests, WSYX-TV reported.  1:35 p.m.: Atlanta’s mayor denounces protests that turned to ‘destruction’ “What we saw overnight was not a protest, and it was not Atlanta … We know our citizens are angry. We are angry and we want justice,” said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms in a statement on Saturday. Friday night’s protest in Atlanta, Georgia, started out as “a peaceful demonstration, quickly turned into mayhem and unnecessary destruction, and ultimately an assault on businesses that are already struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Lance Bottoms. The protests were a result of the most recent police-involved killings of African Americans across the country as well as the murder of Ahmaud Arbery who was shot while jogging on Feb. 23 in Satilla Shores, Georgia. The city’s Department of Public Works have been cleaning up the streets, the Department of Transportation is removing graffiti and the National Guard has been contacted for assistance in order to “help our city recover,” said Lance Bottoms. “If we are to enact change in this nation, I implore everyone to channel their anger and sorrow into something more meaningful and effective through non-violent activism,” said Lance Bottoms. 1:16 p.m.: A federal officer died, another injured in California One Federal Protective Service officer has died, and another was wounded Friday night, the FBI said in a statement to ABC News. As an arm of the Department of Homeland Security., FPS officers are responsible for protecting federal buildings across the country. A car pulled up to the building and started firing, according to the FBI. The agency doesn’t say if the incident was related to protests in the city. 22 people were arrested during demonstrations in the Oakland Friday night, according to authorities. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to ABC News’ request for comment 12:18 p.m.: A mayor in Mississippi faces backlash for ‘breathe’ comments The mayor of Petal, Mississippi, is facing backlash and calls for him to resign after justifying former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for keeping his knee on George Floyd’s neck. “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing,” Mayor Hal Marx wrote on his now deactivated Twitter account on May 26 — the same day Chauvin was seen on a 10-minute video kneeling on Floyd. Similar remarks were made after former NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo was seen on video using an alleged unauthorized chokehold to allegedly kill Eric Garner in 2014. Garner’s last words, “I can’t breathe” became a national rallying cry against police violence. Marx defended his remarks on Twitter, and his deactivated Facebook page as misinterpretations. The Petal Board of Aldermen held a special meeting on Thursday, voting unanimously to ask for Marx’s resignation, The Clarion Ledger reported. Marx has refused to step aside.  10:58 a.m.: NYPD arrested over 200 during protests Demonstrations throughout New York City Friday night resulted in the arrest of over 200, including one person in Brooklyn who had a loaded gun and a woman who was armed with a lit Molotov cocktail. More than 3000 demonstrators gathered in Foley Square and outside Barclays Center, police said. At the height of the protests, 37 patrol cars were vandalized with graffiti and broken windows, a police van was set on fire and a Molotov cocktail was thrown into an occupied police car — the officers inside were not hurt. There were more than a dozen officers injured, ranging from teeth knocked out to shoulder and head injuries. 10:47 a.m.: 1,000 more National Guard service members activated in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced on Saturday morning that an additional thousand members of the National Guard will be deployed to “support civil authorities” during protests over the murder of George Floyd. “Our communities of color, our business community were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses it took a decade to build,” said Walz during a press conference Saturday morning. Protests turned violent with fires set across the city, objects were thrown at the police and dozens have been arrested, officials said. Over 700 soldiers and air service members’ duty were activated overnight. What’s happening in the city is in “no way about the murder of George Floyd it’s about attacking civil society and installing fear,” said Walz. “We cannot as members of the community tolerate that,” said Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington at a press conference on Saturday. Officials said only about 20% of the rioters are Minnesota residents. Walz noted that practicing First Amendment rights should also involve practicing COVID-19 guidelines, but “the folks that are gathering out there … the masks were worn to disguise, to cause confusion and take advantage of that situation.” “The Minnesota National Guard is prepared to protect life, protect property and restore order,” according to a press release by the state’s National Guard. 9:24 a.m.: FBI director calls George Floyd investigation “a top priority” ABC News has obtained a message to FBI employees sent by FBI Director Chris Wray, on Friday. In it, Wray said the investigation into the circumstances surrounding George Floyd’s death “is a top priority, and experienced prosecutors and FBI agents have been assigned to the matter.” He said the investigation “will determine whether the actions by the former Minneapolis police officers involved in this incident violated federal law.” He also wrote about how damaging the failure to honor the rights of citizens, particularly those in custody, can be. “Law enforcement officers have indispensable and often dangerous jobs, but that doesn’t diminish the crucial, overarching role we play in society – to protect and serve all citizens no matter their race, creed, orientation, or station in life. This, of course, includes those citizens who are in law enforcement custody,” Wray said. “When we fail to honor their rights, we not only tarnish the badge we wear, we completely erode the trust so many of us in law enforcement work so hard to build, particularly within minority communities. The events this past week in Minneapolis clearly illustrate just how quickly that trust can be lost,” the message stated.” 8:41 a.m.: White House protesters would have been met with “most vicious dogs,” “most ominous weapons,” president tweets President Trump fired off a series of tweets Saturday morning praising the Secret Service after protesters marched in front of the White House Friday night. “They were not only totally professional, but very cool,” he president tweeted. “They let the “protesters” scream & rant as much as they wanted…” he wrote. The president also wrote that if protestors had become “too frisky” or “got out of line,” “they would quickly come down on them,” he wrote. He also tweeted that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would have been “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” He also took a jab at D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. “On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice!,” the president tweeted. 8:19 a.m.: FBI issues statement on Oakland shooting The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a statement after one person was killed, and another injured in a shooting at that took place while protests were happening in Oakland, California. FBI San Francisco and Oakland police are investigating, but it is unknown yet if the shooting is connected to the protest. “FBI San Francisco and the Oakland Police Department are investigating a shooting that occurred at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at 1301 Clay Street in Oakland, California.,” the statement read. “At approximately 9:45pm on Friday, May 29, 2020, a vehicle approached the building. An individual inside the vehicle began firing gunshots at contract security officers for the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security. One officer was killed and another was injured,” according to the statement. “The FBI has deployed investigators and the Evidence Response Team to the crime scene. We will continue to work this investigation alongside the Oakland Police Department,” the statement continued. 7:24 a.m.: Portland mayor declares State of Emergency Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced Saturday morning that he’s declaring a State of Emergency in the city following the destructive unrest in the wake of the death of Floyd. He also announced the city has a curfew in effect until 6 a.m. local time Saturday and will begin again at 8 p.m. “Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything,” Wheeler said in a statement Saturday. “This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting.” Overnight the Portland Police Department declared the protest as a riot after “significant vandalism” was reported and a fire was set inside the city’s Justice Center. Police said there was also a shooting connected to the protest. Police said large sections of downtown were closed and that protesters should “disperse now or you will be subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal.” 5:43 a.m.: 1 dead in Detroit after person opens fire on protesters from vehicle One person is dead in Detroit after a vehicle drove up on people protesting the death of Floyd and opened fire, according to authorities. A gray Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, hitting a 19-year-old man who later died at the hospital, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson told ABC affiliate WXYZ. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the violence and destruction overnight is not what the city of Detroit is about. “This does not represent the vast major of Detroiters who came here to make a statement,” Craig said during a press conference Friday night. “We support the message, but let’s do it peacefully.” He said many of the people taunting police officers and trying to incite violence have come from outside the city to sow chaos. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city. They are not from this city,” Craig said. “Let’s peacefully protest, but outside of that, we’re not going to tolerate it. We’re not going to tolerate criminal acts.” 4:26 a.m.: ‘Prudent’ to have Army units ready to deploy to Minnesota, governor says As fires raged and protests escalated even further throughout Minneapolis Saturday morning, local and state officials said getting the chaos under control will take a response never before seen in the state because “there’s simply more of them than us.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said at least 1,000 additional Minnesota National Guard troops would be activated Saturday, and even then, that might not be enough. “You may have seen or heard that, this evening, the president directed the Pentagon to put units of United States Army on alert to possible operation in Minneapolis,” Maj. General John Jensen, Adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard, said during a press conference Saturday. “While we were not consulted with, as it relates to that, I do believe it’s a prudent move to provide other options available for the governor, if the governor elects to use those resources.” Walz said it’s more complicated than just saying yes and deploying them now because the move to have federal troops patrolling in Minneapolis would be something never before seen in the state. “I spoke with President Trump the other night, I think it is prudent to have them ready for us to exhaust all resources that we need,” Walz said Saturday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Walz angrily took to the podium Saturday morning to ask those setting fires, attacking officers and looting businesses to stop. “We as a city can be so much better than this,” Frey said at the press conference Saturday. “There is no honor in burning down your city. There is no pride in looting local businesses that have become institutions of a neighborhood.” He said people, especially during a pandemic, are counting on grocery stores being open to get groceries, pharmacies to get needed medicine and banks to get money. “If you care about your community, you got to put this to an end; it needs to stop,” Frey said. Walz said the tragedy of Floyd’s death has morphed into “an unprecedented threat to our state,” where those causing destruction have no regard to property or life. Dozens of arrests were made on Friday, but an official total has not been released for the city. In one instance, shots were fired at law enforcement officers overnight. 1:48 a.m.: Shots fired at law enforecment officers in Minnesota Shots were fired at law enforcement officers in Minneapolis early Saturday morning near the police department’s Fifth Precinct, according to Minnesota State Police. No officers are believed to have been hit. Following the shots, authorities warned residents to leave the area immediately or they would be arrested. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said there are 350 officers and troopers in the area and “officers have arrested several people who ignored multiple dispersal orders.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz pleaded with protesters overnight to go home. “Minnesotans, please go home. It’s time to restore peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,” Walz said in a statement. “The situation has become dangerous for Minnesotans and first responders.” Protesters took over the Minnesota Police Department’s Third Precinct building late Thursday night and ignited several fires. 12:58 a.m.: LAPD asks residents to stay inside, businesses to close in downtown LA The Los Angeles Police Department has asked downtown Los Angeles residents to stay inside and for all businesses to close due to the escalating protests in the city. “We have declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown LA,” the department said in a statement Friday. The areas impacted are from the 10 Freeway to the 101 Highway and the 110 Freeway to Alameda. “This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage,” LAPD said. “Those on the street are to leave the area.” The department previously asked people to avoid downtown Los Angeles Friday, including nearby side streets and freeways. 12:27 a.m.: Georgia issues State of Emergency, activates National Guard Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced Friday night that he has issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County, where protests have turned violent in downtown Atlanta. He also announced that he’s activating 500 Georgia National Guard members. “At the request of Mayor @KeishaBottoms & in consultation with public safety & emergency preparedness officials, I have issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County to activate as many as 500 @GeorgiaGuard troops to protect people & property in Atlanta,” Kemp tweeted Friday. He said the troops would deploy immediately to help local and state law enforcement officials get control of the “unlawful activity” and to “restore peace.” “We will continue to make all state resources available to local leaders during this emergency situation,” he said. 10:21 p.m.: Protests grow violent in Brooklyn Protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis erupted Friday night in Brooklyn where there have been at least 150 arrests, police sources told ABC News. The protest outside Barclays Center, the home of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, began peacefully, but drew what police sources described as professional agitators and turned ugly. There were more than 100 protesters detained outside the arena, mainly for throwing bottles and other disturbances. Protesters moved toward two police precincts in northern Brooklyn, the 88th Precinct in Fort Green and the 79th Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Along the way, a police van was set on fire and several cruisers were defaced with graffiti and broken windows. Some 500 demonstrators massed outside the 88 Precinct, where the van was set on fire. There were about 40 arrests there. Some demonstrators made it inside the 79 Precinct but were immediately arrested There have been about a dozen officers hurt so far in clashes with the protesters. 9:21 p.m.: Atlanta sees violence spark outside CNN A protest in Atlanta grew violent this evening as a handful of protesters began smashing the doors to CNN Headquarters just after 8 p.m., according to Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB. After defacing the outside of the news network’s HQ and lighting a police car on fire, protesters began throwing objects at police who are inside the building’s lobby. Police were holding a line with shields. “Above everything else, I am a mother. I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a press conference Friday night. “When i saw the murder of George Floyd I hurt like a mother would hurt. And yesterday when I heard about rumors of violent protests in Atlanta, I did what a mother would do, I called my son and said, ‘Where are you?’ I cannot protect you and black boys should not be out today.” “So you’re not gonna out-concern me or out-care about where we are in America,” she added. “I wear this each and every day and I pray over my children each and every day.” 8:19 p.m.: Protest outside White House draws Secret Service  A protest this evening in Lafayette Park just north of the White House has drawn the assistance of the Secret Service. Chants of “Let him breathe,” and, “don’t shoot,” could be heard. The U.S. Secret Service tweeted, “Secret Service personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration in Lafayette Park. In the interest of public safety we encourage all to remain peaceful.” 5:31 p.m.: Trump says he spoke to Floyd’s family  Trump told reporters at a business roundtable event Friday afternoon that he had spoken to the family of George Floyd, four days after his death. “I spoke to members of the family. Terrific people. And we’ll be reporting as time goes by. We think that we’ll also have to make the statement,” Trump said. “It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory — let it be a perfect memory.” The president also took the chance to emphasize peaceful protests, following controversial tweets earlier Friday in which he said “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” “It’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights for peaceful protesters. We can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well,” the president said. “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters.” 4:21 p.m.: Minneapolis, St. Paul enforce curfew Gov. Tim Walz has said a curfew will be in place starting Friday night from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Saturday in the entire Twin Cities region. No one will be allowed in the streets in public except for first responders and media. The curfew will also be in place Saturday night at 8 p.m. to Sunday 6 a.m. “It’s time to rebuild our community and that starts with safety in our streets,” Walz said in a statement. “Thousands of Minnesotans have expressed their grief and frustration in a peaceful manner. But the unlawful and dangerous actions of others, under the cover of darkness, has caused irreversible pain and damage to our community. This behavior has compromised the safety of bystanders, businesses, lawful demonstrators, and first responders. Now, we come together to restore the peace.” Officers will arrest those who do not comply, Walz said. Earlier, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had already issued a curfew order for the city for the same times. 3:40 p.m.: Prosecutors reveal more details about charges on former officer The Hennepin County Attorney released the full criminal complaint for former officer Derek Chauvin. The 44-year-old officer who was filmed putting his knee on Floyd’s neck faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for third-degree murder charges and a maximum of 10 years behind bars for manslaughter charges. “Derek Michael Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd by his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and taking a chance of causing death or great bodily harm to George Floyd,” the complaint read. “The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” according to the complaint. 3:07 p.m.: Floyd’s family responds to former officer’s arrest  While they said they were pleased with that he was apprehended, they said they expected first-degree murder charges. “We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,” they said in a statement. The family also asked for the remaining three officers to be arrested and charged. 2:28 p.m.: Trump tweets against looting President Trump again doubled down on his earlier remarks about the ongoing protests. He tweeted again that “looting leads to shooting” citing “what just happened with 7 people shot.” In Minneapolis. “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means,” he tweeted 2:26 p.m.: Bill Barr releases statement on Floyd death Attorney General Bill Barr said the Department of Justice and FBI are conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated in George Floyd’s death. “The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,” he said in a statement. Barr said the state’s charging decisions will be made first. 1:22 p.m.: Officer arrested in connection with Floyd’s death Derek Chauvin, one of the four former officers fired for their involvement in George Floyd’s death, has been taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is scheduled to give a news conference on developments in the case at 2 p.m.  1:09 p.m.: Cops warn of anarchists infiltrating protests ABC News obtained a police bulletin issued to the Philadelphia Police Department and the Delaware Valley Intelligence Center that warned that anarchists and other groups are calling on their supporters to commit acts of violence against police officers in light of the protests in Minneapolis. The bulletin said there have been several social media posts calling for looting and civil disobedience as well as other acts of violence. “Domestic extremists, including anarchist extremists and other anti-government extremists, are using the unrest in Minneapolis to amplify and justify their calls for dismantling law enforcement agencies and carrying out attacks on law enforcement, government, and capitalist targets,” the bulletin said. The bulletin stressed that non-violent protests are legal and protected by the Constitution. “Anarchist extremists may be attracted to this call to action and engage in direct action against law enforcement property, such as buildings and vehicles, in order to draw attention to their cause,” it said.  12:56 p.m.: Obama offers statement on George Floyd of our darkest chapters’ Former President Barack Obama issued a statement on social media about Floyd’s death and the subsequent protests in Minneapolis. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” he wrote. “It can’t be ‘normal.’ If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.” Obama said it is up to Minnesota officials to ensure that Floyd’s death is fully investigated and justice is ultimately done, however, he encouraged people “to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”  12:40 p.m.: Governor calls on order to be restored after ‘one of our darkest chapters’ Gov. Tim Walz called the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests that took place have been “one of our darkest chapters.” However, he said he refused to let those who caused destruction to Minneapolis “take away the attention of the stain that we need to be working on” and pleaded with the community to help restore order. Walz said that the “looting and recklessness” that occurred was not caused by those who wanted justice for Floyd. “We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues,” the governor said, later calling one of the issues “fundamental institutional racism.” He said that he would not “patronize” the black community as a white man, but asked the community to “help us use a humane way to get the streets back to a place where we can restore justice.” Walz started off his press conference by acknowledging generations of pain and anguish that communities of color in America have experienced. He said that those communities have not been truly heard, “much like we failed to hear George Floyd as he pleaded for his life, as the world watched, by the people sworn to protect him, his community, our state.” The commissioner for the state’s Department of Public Safety called Floyd’s death “murder.” “That’s what it looked like to me,” Commissioner John Harrington said. His comment marked the first time a member of law enforcement call Floyd’s death murder publicly. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison began his remarks by quoting Martin Luther King Jr., saying “riot is the way that the unheart get heard.” He said King urged people not to dismiss non-peaceful protests or relegate it as criminality, but ask what was really going on there. Ellison said that protesters should not react to the National Guard in the way that may react to the Minneapolis Police Department. He noted they are two different agencies and “their job is trying to bring peace and calm back again.” Ellison said that although people continue to ask when justice will be served, he believes authorities understand that “the wheels of justice must turn swiftly.” He also said that while the investigation and criminal procedure for this case is important, it by no means addresses the root of these problems in this country. “I think we’re gonna do some real change. … We’re not just gonna fix the windows and sweep up the glass. We’re gonna fix the broken, shattered society that leaves so many behind.” 11:10 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights. Jenkins said that the anger of the community has been expressed and she did not want further action to lead to injuries or loss of life. “We can’t allow this type of civic unrest to continue,” she said. Jenkins on Thursday called on city officials to declare racism a public health crisis. “By declaring racism a public health emergency it provides us the opportunity to name the virus that has infected our American institutions for centuries but in addition, it gives us the opportunities to … you can’t really begin to cure a disease until you know what that disease is,” she said. “It’s an infectious disease just like the coronavirus and it’s not just Minneapolis.” 11 a.m.: Trump says National Guard is in Minneapolis President Donald Trump tweeted that the National Guard is now in Minneapolis. “They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared,” the president wrote. “George Floyd will not have died in vain.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Photos showed members of the National Guard in the streets of Minneapolis. Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Thursday activating the Minnesota National Guard after Wednesday night’s destructive protests. 10:50 pm.: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden said he was “furious” over President Donald Trump’s tweet on the protests “I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too,” Biden wrote. Trump tweeted in the early morning hours of Friday that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” referring to the protests. He also called protesters “thugs.” Enough. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 29, 2020 Biden said that he will be speaking more later today about the situation in Minneapolis. He also addressed a CNN crew being arrested. “This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything,” Biden said, with the swift action appearing to refer to their release. 10:20 a.m.: Melania Trump says there is ‘no reason for violence’ First Lady Melania Trump said the nation needs to focus on healing and “there is no reason for violence.” “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she tweeted. “I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now.” Trump also offered her “deepest condolences” to Floyd’s family. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing,” the first lady wrote.  Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify & take care of one another through COVID19 & we can’t stop now. My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 29, 2020 10:09 a.m.: City is handling situation in ‘best way that we can,’ city council VP says Minneapolis’ city council vice president said the government is still adjusting to the situation, but is handling it “in the best way that we can given all of the chaos, all of the unrest, all of the anger and pain in this community.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told ABC News’ Amy Robach on Friday that the city must take control of the situation and “restore some order back.” She also begged people not to gather in the streets, citing the pandemic and the damage that has been done in the last two nights.

It won’t be easy, but it’s essential,” Crump wrote on Twitter. If only I were surprised by this hypocrisy. Minneapolis PD arrests journalists but not murderers from within its own ranks. These problems will require systematic change to start the healing process. It won’t be easy, but it’s essential. https://t.co/2wC3qxLWFT — Benjamin Crump, Esq. (@AttorneyCrump) May 29, 2020 6:59 a.m.: CNN reporter, crew arrested live on air CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and his production crew were arrested in Minneapolis live on air Friday morning while reporting on the Floyd protests. The news outlet is reporting that police said they were arrested because they were told to move and didn’t. “A CNN reporter & his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves – a clear violation of their First Amendment rights,” CNN said in a statement Friday morning. “The authorities in Minnesota, incl. the Governor, must release the 3 CNN employees immediately.” Minnesota State Sen. Jeff Hayden phoned into CNN and said he just had a joint text with the governor and mayor and that they were just trying to get control of the area and weren’t aware of the CNN reporter getting arrested. “Hoping that we can figure it out,” Hayden said. 6:44 a.m.: 70 arrested or summonsed in New York City during George Floyd protests At least 70 people were arrested or summonsed during a series of protests that started in Union Square and spread through Lower Manhattan through Thursday night. Most will be summonsed for obstruction of governmental administration and social distancing violations, but there will also be assault and weapon possession charges. The protest began in Union Square after 3 p.m., Thursday but after that broke up, protests reemerged at Foley Square courthouses, City Hall and Zuccotti Park, the site of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest, and moved toward the West Side Highway. Several police officers were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one with a possible concussion. One person was arrested for assaulting a police officer for throwing a garbage can into a crowd and striking a police officer in the head. Another person attempted to grab the service weapon from a Deputy Inspector’s holster. That person will be charged with robbery. 1:15 a.m.: Trump says military could assume control in city, ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’ President Donald Trump weighed in on the destructive protests in Minneapolis early Friday morning, saying the military could “assume control” of the response. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also attacked Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying the protests are a result of a lack of leadership. “Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right,” Trump tweeted. Frey responded to Trump at an early-morning press conference Friday, saying it’s weakness to point fingers during times of crisis. “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis,” Frey said. “Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re gonna get through this.” 12:48 a.m.: Minneapolis asks residents to ‘retreat’ over precinct explosion possibility After people protesting George Floyd’s death forcibly took over a Minneapolis precinct and began to ignite fires, city officials are now warning residents to leave the area in case the building explodes. “We’re hearing unconfirmed reports that gas lines to the Third Precinct have been cut and other explosive materials are in the building,” the city tweeted. “If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes.” Frey said residents must clear the area so the fire department can put out fires. “We are working with @MinneapolisFire to deliver resources and respond for a beloved neighborhood in our city,” Frey tweeted. “We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.” The Minnesota National Guard has been activated for the area and said it’s helping the fire department safely get to fires to help them battle the blazes. Since the protests started, the Saint Paul Police Department said more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted. Despite the destruction, with dozens of fires set, authorities said there are no reports of serious injuries. “Calm on the horizon,” the department said late Thursday night. 12:32 a.m.: Governor ‘shocked’ after vehicle attempts to run over protester Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is “absolutely shocked” by video of a car attempting to run over a person protesting the death of Floyd in Denver on Thursday. What started as a peaceful protest turned chaotic with reports of vandalism and violence. “Tonight is a very sad night for our state. While we are still uncovering all of the facts, a protest regarding the killing of George Floyd devolved into vandalism and violence, and I was absolutely shocked by video evidence of a motorist attempting to run over a protestor,” Polis tweeted. “Coloradans are better than this. I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” Previously shots were fired across the street from Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver. 11:51 p.m.: Protesters gain access to police precinct  People protesting the death of Floyd have reportedly taken over the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd precinct and set it on fire, according to authorities. Minneapolis Police spokesperson John Elder said staff was evacuated from the building around 10 p.m. local time and that protesters forcibly entered the building and ignited several fires. Shortly after reports of the precinct takeover, the Minnesota National Guard said it was deploying more than 500 soldiers to the area. “We have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities,” the National Guard said in a statement. “Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate. A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls.” 9:20 p.m.: Colorado protest marred by gunshots Protesters outside Colorado’s State Capitol in Denver received a scare when someone apparently fired shots nearby, causing the assembled group to flee. There were no injuries, authorities confirmed to ABC News. “Officers on scene at W Colfax Ave and W 15 st on shots fired in the area of the Capital. This is an ongoing investigation and the motive is unknown,” Denver police wrote on Twitter. Leslie Herod, who is a state representative, tweeted about the incident as well. She added that someone was apprehended, though police have not confirmed any arrests. The Capitol was put on lockdown, with Herod, who fled inside included. Herod told an ABC News producer she was not scared by the incident. “No. This only makes me more resolved. We have more work to do,” she said. 8:31 p.m.: 911 call released The 911 call made by the store owner who accused Floyd of using fraudulent money was released by authorities Thursday evening. According to the transcript of the call released by the state of Minnesota, the caller — a store owner — told the operator that Floyd entered the store drunk and tried to pay for something with “fake bills.” He later left the shop and sat on his car. It was there where police found him when they arrived at the scene. “Someone comes [to] our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was [sic] sitting on their car,” the caller said. “We tell them to give us their phone, put their… thing back and everything, and he was also drunk and everything and return to give us our cigarettes back and so he can, so he can go home but he doesn’t want to do that, and he’s sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” The operator then asked the caller for Floyd’s race and sex. “No, he’s a black guy,” the caller replied. “Alright,” the operator said, letting out a sigh according to the transcript, before the caller asked, “How is your day going?” 6:25 p.m.: Investigation is ‘top priority’ for DOJ The Department of Justice has made the investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority,” Erica MacDonald, attorney for state of Minnesota, said at a press conference. MacDonald said President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr are “directly and actively” monitoring the case. “It is critical, it is essential, it is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time,” she said. “And that is what we are going to do.” No federal or state charges against the officers were announced at the press conference. Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman asked for “patience.” “Give us the time to do this right and we will bring you justice — I promise,” Freeman said. He said his office has been flooded with calls on the status of the investigation. The main question, he said, has been, “what’re you gonna do about the murder of George Floyd?” “We are going to investigate as thoroughly as justice demands,” Freeman said. He called the officer’s action “excessive and wrong,” but said he needs to determine if it was criminal. Both MacDonald and Freeman called on the public to come forward with any information they may have. There was a delay in starting the press conference, which MacDonald apologized for and said she was hoping to share a development but that it was not the right time. 5:35 p.m.: City releases complaint history of 4 officers The police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was involved in 18 complaints prior to being fired, according to records released by the city. Derek Chauvin, who was fired following Floyd’s death, was only disciplined for two of those complaints, according to the city records. The documents do not provide the details of the complaints or the disciplines. Tou Thao, who was the officer seen standing up in the video, had six complaints, one of which remains open, according to the records. Thao, who was also fired, was not disciplined for the other five complaints. The other two officers who were fired, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng, have had no complaints. 5:15 p.m.: Governor signs executive order activating National Guard Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard following Wednesday night’s protests. Walz said the purpose of the National Guard was “to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.” “The anger and grief of this moment is unbearable. People deserve to be seen. People deserve to be heard. People deserve to be safe,” he said in a statement. “While many Minnesotans are taking extensive safety precautions while exercising their right to protest, the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved.” The National Guard Adjutant General will work with local government agencies to provide personnel, equipment, and facilities needed to respond to and recover from the protests, according to Walz’s office. There will also be about 200 members of the Minnesota State Patrol that will work with state, county, and local community and public safety partners. State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft on the ground will assist law enforcement officers, the governor’s office said. 5:03 p.m.: Families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery issue joint statement The families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery — all of whom died after incidents with current and former law enforcement — are demanding change and calling for government action to address this “national crisis.” “We’re devastated about the senseless violence that has broken the hearts of our families,” the families said in a joint statement. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive. This is a national crisis and our government needs to take immediate and widespread action to protect our black and brown communities.” The families have called for a congressional hearing and a national task force to create new bipartisan legislation that is aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability. They will also present a case to United Nation Human Rights Committee for sweeping changes to the nation’s criminal justice system. A date for when they would be presenting their case was not provided. Taylor, a black woman, was a front-line worker who died after a police-involved shooting. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping inside their Springfield Drive apartment on March 13 when officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department attempted to execute a “no-knock” search warrant. Three plainclothes officers opened Taylor’s front door and “blindly” opened fire into their apartment, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in April by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Taylor was shot at least eight times and died. Arbery, a black man, was out for a jog when two white men saw him and set off to confront him, police said. The men, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, were armed. A video shows Arbery and Travis McMichael tussling with the shotgun before three shots are fired. Arbery stumbled and fell to the ground, where he was pronounced dead. City leaders react to protests The mayor, police chief and city council vice president in Minneapolis emotionally addressed the violent protests that took place Wednesday night over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died. Mayor Jacob Frey, who at one point became choked up and tearful, said that the protests were “the result of so much built up anger and sadness.” “Anger and sadness that has been engrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years,” Frey said at a press conference. “If you’re feeling that sadness and anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he knew that there was a “deficit of hope” in the community and that his department has contributed to that deficit. He also said that the violence and destruction seen in Wednesday night’s protest was mostly caused by a “core group of people” who were not from Minnesota. He said that most of the community members who have been protesting since Floyd’s death Monday have been peaceful. Arradondo said he wanted to ensure that people could safely protest, but he said he could not allow for criminal acts. Wednesday night’s protest caused destruction and chaos in Minneapolis, including a deadly shooting, looting and multiple fires. The protests, which had been largely peaceful up until Wednesday night, were in wake of Floyd’s death after he was apprehended by Minneapolis police Monday. Disturbing video emerged on social media showing a police officer with his knee on the man’s neck as the man repeatedly yells out, “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe, please, the knee in my neck,” the man said in a video showing a police officer pinning him to the ground. “I can’t move … my neck … I’m through, I’m through.” City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins sang “Amazing Grace” at Thursday’s press conference before addressing the protests. Jenkins said she wanted to offer “amazing grace” and her condolences to the Floyd family. “We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks, a knee that says black lives do not matter,” Jenkins, who is black, said. “I am part of this system to help to take that knee off of our necks.” Jenkins, Frey and Arradondo said they would be working with the community leaders. A “healing space” will be created at the 3rd Precinct in Minneapolis for residents to express their concerns and anger in a safe and humane way, Jenkins said. Overnight developments Police said during the protests they responded to a call of a stabbing victim and found a man in grave condition near the protests. The man later died in the hospital and authorities learned he died from a gunshot wound, according to John Elder, the director of communication for Minneapolis police. One person was in custody after the shooting, police said. It was not immediately clear what led to the shooting, but the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the owner of a pawn shop opened fire on a man he believed was burglarizing his business and fatally shot him. Police said multiple businesses were looted during the protests and the city’s fire department said there were 30 intentional fires during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires. Massive flames were seen in the sky on videos that circulated throughout social media. As of Thursday afternoon, the fire department said crews were still extinguishing fires along East Lake Street. People were also throwing rocks at fire department vehicles responding to the scene, according to the fire department, which noted there were no firefighter injuries. Elder had said people were throwing rocks at firefighters. Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, wrote on Twitter the family thanked the protesters and wanted peace in Minneapolis, but “knows that Black people want peace in their souls — and until we get #JusticeForFloyd there will be no peace.” “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors and endanger each other as we respond to the necessary urge to raise our voices in unison and in outrage,” Crump wrote Thursday morning. “Looting and violence distract from strength of our collective voice.” Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 — Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) May 28, 2020 The city requested assistance from the National Guard late Wednesday during the protests, according to ABC Saint Paul affiliate KSTP. The National Guard did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment. “Tonight was a different night of protesting. Last night we had 8,000 protestors all peaceful. Tonight we did not have that,” Elder said. Elder said that there were no serious injuries to officers. He was not sure about the number of people arrested. The fire department said there were no civilian injuries from the fires. Gov. Tim Walz urged people to leave the area as the situation escalated. “The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone’s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene,” Walz wrote on Twitter. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also asked people to evacuate the area. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” Frey wrote on Twitter. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing Floyd’s death. On Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office were conducting a “robust” criminal investigation into his death. “The federal investigation will determine whether the actions by the involved former Minneapolis Police Department officers violated federal law. It is a violation of federal law for an individual acting under color of law to willfully deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,” according to a joint statement from United States Attorney Erica MacDonald And FBI Special Agent In Charge Rainer Drolshagen. The officers involved in the incident were identified by police as Officer Derek Chauvin, Officer Thomas Lane, Officer Tou Thao and Officer J Alexander Kueng. All four officers were fired, according to Frey. “This is the right call,” the mayor said. The Minneapolis Police Department said Monday that officers were initially called to the scene “on a report of a forgery in progress” in a statement on their website. The statement added that officers were advised that the suspect “appeared to be under the influence” and that he “physically resisted officers.” He later “appeared to be suffering medical distress” and officers called an ambulance. He was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance, “where he died a short time later.” The police department said there were no weapons of any type used by anyone involved in the incident and no officers were injured.

(WPTA21) - Law enforcement have fired more tear gas at protestors. Friday evening, organizers planned the first ""I Can't Breathe"" protest at the Allen County Courthouse green to demand justice for George Floyd. Floyd was an unarmed black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. The white officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes is now facing murder charges in his death. Protesters and police clashed Friday evening, with tear gas being deployed. Windows and glass panels to nearby businesses and buildings were damaged. On Saturday, protesters again gathered at the Allen County Courthouse. Once demonstrators began to block traffic closer to 5 p.m., police in a tactical vehicle used a loud speaker to warn protesters to get out of the street or face arrest. Protesters started to scatter, but then filled the street again stopping traffic. That's when law enforcement fired tear gas into the crowd. Our cameras captured people running from the smoke, and some people tossed tear gas canisters back at police. Protesters made their way north and gathered at the Martin Luther King Memorial Bridge. They began heading down Fourth Street and marched south on Spy Run Avenue back into downtown. Law enforcement fired more tear gas as protesters remained in the street. This is a breaking news story.

In some cities, authorities issued curfews in light of the at-times violent protests and destruction taking place. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney implemented a mandatory citywide curfew starting at 8 p.m. and lasting until 6 a.m. as protests turned violent Saturday. Multiple police vehicles are reported to have been set on fire after protestors and police officers clashed. Buildings have been vandalized and mass looting broke out Saturday afternoon. Fox News Crew Chased, Attacked By Angry Mob While Reporting On Protests Outside White House The protest started peacefully in front of City Hall as hundreds of people knelt in silence in honor of George Floyd. “We appreciate their voice and their manner of expression. However, since that time, others have convened in Center City and are committing criminal acts, including vandalism. Those acts will not be tolerated,” the Philadelphia Police Department tweeted. Video posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be Chicago police officers being swarmed, hit and dragged by protesters. Protesters again converged on the White House, as some climbed on top of Secret Service cars and pushed security barricades further down Pennsylvania Avenue. POLICE CHIEFS ACROSS US CONDEMN OFFICERS INVOLVED IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH President Trump had praised the Secret Service’s action Friday night by saying the protestors would “…have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons,” had they crossed the White House fence. But Trump criticized D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for not letting D.C. police get involved, quoting her as saying “not their job.” Bowser fired back, first calling Trump’s comments “gross” and saying his reference to attack dogs ignited the worst memories in America’s fight against segregation. “We are grieving hundreds of years of institutional racism,” Bowser said. “People are tired, sad, angry and desperate for change.” PROTESTS DEMANDING JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD RAMP UP AGAIN NATIONWIDE Bowser, who was joined by D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham, also said that Trump’s claims regarding the D.C. police were false. D.C. police were present, along with U.S. Park Police, Friday night and were ready to help Secret Service in Layfette Park, the area where protestors gathered in front of the White House, as they have done in the past. Close to 300 protestors have reportedly been arrested in New York City between Thursday and Friday night, and demonstrators have continued to protest through Saturday. New Yorkers mourned the death of Eric Garner who died from an NYPD officer’s chokehold in 2014 by attending a rally the Rev. Al Sharpton hosted. The crowd chanted “I can’t breathe,” which were the last words Garner reportedly said — but also one of the last statements said by Floyd before he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Trump has responded to the nationwide protests by blaming liberal leaders and threatening use of the military involvement. In a tweet Saturday, he said: “Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military.”",0.0

At noon today a gathering was assembled at the Four Freedoms Monument which organizers tell us was meant to be peaceful. Police said around 1:30 p.m. the gathering marched to the front of the Civic Center. Approximately 300 protesters were in the area, according to police. EPD officers stood in front of the Civic Center to observe the crowd and to allow the peaceful protest to continue. Around 5:15 p.m., EPD says one protester crossed through a police barricade in an attempt to provoke officers. Authorities say a second protester crossed the line as well, and things were being thrown at officers. EPD says one of their horses was struck in the face and an officer was struck during another arrest. The four people arrested are facing charges including battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting law enforcement, as well as other charges. EPD deemed the protest to be unlawful around 5:30 p.m. because of the assaults on law enforcement and a commanding officer gave commands for the crowd to disperse. The crowd was given a specified amount of time to leave the area, and eventually left the area of the Civic Center.

1621222729,2020-05-30 20:49:02,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.wane.com/news/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,"blacks, police, demonstrations and riots",94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Hundreds of people took to the streets of downtown Evansville, protesting in response to the death of George Floyd. “It’s time for us to make a change,” says Ebonique Ellis, rally organizer. “It’s time for us to come together. It’s time for us to unite. It doesn’t matter about the gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation. It doesn’t matter about any of that. At the end of the day, we all bleed red.” Dozens of signs waved in the air as many chanted for calls of Peace, Justice, and Unity. “I am black. This is my life,” says Zavree Russell, protester. “I can’t go to places without worrying about being killed. I can’t go on a jog, I can’t use my cellphone, I can’t play with toy guns, I can’t ride my bike. I can’t do anything without being worried about being shot and killed for the color of my skin, and that is why I am here.” Many citizens said they protested for future generations. “I have a son. His name is Elbon Latrent Ellis Jr,” says Ellis. “As he gets older, as he gets older man, he’s not gonna be in my presence all the time. I had to speak my voice. Something had to be changed. If I can’t be around my son, if I won’t be able to see him, I should not be afraid that he’s not going to come home to me.” Some city leaders were also in attendance for the peaceful protest, including Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke. “Ya know, they say you can’t get better until you admit that you have a problem,” says Winnecke. “We’ve got a problem. Not just here but the world. What you see going on in cities across the country is a manifestation of great anger and disgust. Ebonique Ellis wanted to leave her fellow protestors with one final message. “We’re all in this together,” says Ellis. “We’re all unified as one, for one common purpose.” Evansville Police say that peaceful gathering, at height, had nearly 300 protesters. Many eventually marched their way to the Civic Center and EPD Headquarters. Police say while the protests were still in progress shortly after 5 in the afternoon, one of the protesters crossed through the police line in an attempt to provoke officers. After one of the protesters crossed the line, a second protester crossed the line as well. At that point things were being thrown at officers and one of the police horses was struck in the face.

""We need you to stay home tonight to be able to respond to those who are trying to loot and burn our city,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Saturday night about the fifth day of unrest. At least six major cities have imposed curfews and numerous states have either activated or requested National Guard forces in anticipation of another night of protests, sparked in part by the death of Floyd -- who was unarmed and handcuffed -- while in Minneapolis police custody. The former officer seen in a video kneeling on Floyd's neck was in custody Saturday and is facing charges in his death. Protesters were blocking highways Austin. Cars were set on fire in Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami. Nearly 100 people had already been arrested in New York City and Philadelphia. In Washington, DC, near the White House, several Secret Service vehicles were damaged. Live updates: Protests spread nationwide   Latest developments   • City curfews: A curfew will be in effect in Atlanta from 9 p.m. ET through sunrise Sunday. Philadelphia will institute a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.Denver instituted a citywide curfew beginning Saturday at 8 p.m. MT to 5 a.m.that will remain in effect through Monday. Milwaukee imposed a curfew Saturday night beginning at 9 p.m. CT and Cincinnati announced a curfew from 10 p.m. ET to 6 a.m. this weekend. • National Guard: At least six states and the District of Columbia have either activated or requested assistance from the National Guard, including Minnesota, Georgia, Ohio, Colorado, Denver and Kentucky. • 21-year-old shot: A young man was killed Friday night in downtown Detroit where protests were taking place. Police had previously said the victim was 19 and that they could not confirm whether the victim was part of the protests. • Clashes and arrests: More than 500 people were arrested in Friday night's protests in Los Angeles, police said. New York City police have made more than 200 arrests connected to protests, and more than a dozen officers have been seriously hurt, according to a senior NYPD source. In Houston, nearly 200 people were arrested and most will be charged with obstructing a roadway, police said. • Pleas for peace: In Dallas, Mayor Eric Johnson implored people destroying property to stop. In Portland, Oregon, police dispersed protesters with tear gas, saying there was extensive property damage. ""Enough,"" Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted.   Minnesota officials say outsiders are hijacking protests   State and local authorities said the violence in Minneapolis was being fueled by outsiders. ""Nothing we do to provide justice"" for Floyd ""matter(s) to any of these people who are out here firing upon the National Guard, burning"" businesses and ""disrupting civil life,"" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters on Saturday. The governor said he understands that ""Minnesotans' ... inability to deal with inequality"" and racism was the catalyst for the protests -- but he said rough estimates indicate only 20% of protesters there are Minnesotans. ""They are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region to prey on everything that we have built over the last several decades,"" Frey said. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said everyone arrested in hist city on Friday night was from out of state. Assertions about outside agitators come partly from arrest data as well as information from fliers and online postings, said John Harrington, the state public safety commissioner, adding that authorities had ""seen things like white supremacists organizers"" who had posted online about going to Minnesota. Officials did not provide further details about who exactly was fueling the unrest and where they were from. Harrington said he hoped to release more information later Saturday. US Attorney General William Barr said the ""voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements"" pursuing ""their own separate and violent agenda."" Without citing evidence, the attorney general said that in many places ""it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom traveled from outside the state to promote the violence."" A Justice Department spokeswoman later said the information underpinning Barr's assertion came from state and local law enforcement.   Vandalism in Los Angeles and Chicago   Protests were underway by late Saturday afternoon in cities like Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, where several Secret Service vehicles were vandalized with graffiti outside the White House. A demonstration in Los Angeles led to clashes between police and protesters. Police vehicles were vandalized in Los Angeles by some protesters who kicked in the windows or sprayed the cars with graffiti. Police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators, who chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""George Floyd."" Aerial footage from CNN affiliate WLS showed protesters in Chicago vandalizing police vehicles. Some threw water bottles at police officers in riot gear, while others were seen lifting police barricades and throwing them at police cars. Meantime, Philadelphia police said protests at City Hall and the Art Museum began peacefully before a group of others began ""committing criminal acts, including vandalism."" In Atlanta, police braced for more potential protests and arrests Saturday night. The Atlanta Police Department said it would be assisted by about 20 other agencies to monitor activity and protect businesses.   Protests turned deadly in some cities   A nation cooped up for weeks over coronavirus restrictions and suffering from resulting job losses now sees throngs of people demonstrating in streets, unleashing powerful emotion in part over the recent deaths of Floyd and other unarmed black Americans. Anger boiled over Friday in more than 30 cities, with some protesters smashing windows, setting vehicles ablaze, blocking traffic on highways and clashing with police. Though protesters called out similar chants for justice, the demonstrations played out differently in each city. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the demonstrations, some protesters knelt under a bridge and prayed. Others tossed rocks at officers who fired rubber bullets in return. Officers stood on top of a precinct armed with nonlethal deterrents as a man in the crowd of protesters tried to climb the gate. When fires moved from the precinct to dumpsters and residential streets, more than 350 troops were deployed to control the groups. Minneapolis and St. Paul were under a curfew after looting and arson broke out during days of protests. But hundreds took to the streets as police fired tear gas and protesters hid behind cars. At a protest in Detroit, one person was shot dead. And in Springfield, Massachusetts, hundreds gathered peacefully. ""If you can tell me something better for me to do -- if you can tell me a way that we could change the world without trying to make noise like that, then I'll get out of the streets,"" Max Bailey, 22, said at the protests in Denver. In Oakland, California, one Federal Protective Service officer was killed and one other injured Friday in a shooting at the downtown federal building during protests in the city, police said. Details about what led to the shooting weren't immediately available. ""It's about time this police brutality has to stop. I don't agree with breaking into all of the businesses, but I can understand the outrage after REPEATED incidents,"" Mackenzie Slagle said of protests in Oakland. ""Because I'm a white woman, and I needed to show up for all my brothers and sisters."" In Atlanta, a day of protests began peacefully but turned violent when a crowd set fire to a police car and smashed windows at CNN Center. ""What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. ""Killer"" was scrawled across a damaged police car in Los Angeles where protesters lined up along a freeway to block traffic. At least two officers were injured during the night, said the LAPD. In Washington, the White House was briefly locked down Friday as protesters moved toward it. Protesters overnight confronted officers, including those from the Secret Service, throwing bottles at them, removing metal barriers and pushing against officers' riot shields. Officers responded at least once by spraying pepper spray.   Bail is set for the officer arrested   The bail for Derek Chauvin, the former officer charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, was set at $500,000. Chauvin, who is white, and three other officers detained Floyd, who was black, in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Outrage grew after a video surfaced showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for a total of 8 minutes, 46 seconds, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. Charges against the other three officers are likely, authorities said. All four officers were fired this week after Floyd's death. Floyd's family is upsetthat Chauvinwasn't charged with a more serious offense, like first-degree murder, their attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the family said in a statement.   Video shows 3 officers kneeling on George Floyd   New video posted on social media appears to show three Minneapolis police officers -- not just Chauvin -- kneeling on Floyd during his arrest. CNN has not been able to locate the person who shot the footage. The new video shows the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle -- the side opposite shown in the first video. ""I can't breathe, man,"" Floyd can be heard saying in the new video. ""Please, let me stand. Please, man."" Minneapolis police had said Floyd, 46, ""physically resisted"" the officers. Surveillance footage from a nearby restaurant does not appear to support the claim that he resisted arrest during the initial encounter. However, there are several minutes when Floyd's and the officers' interactions cannot be seen from that camera's vantage point. A preliminary autopsy said the combined effects of Floyd being restrained, potential intoxicants in his system and underlying health issues, including heart disease, contributed to his death. It said there was no physical findings to support strangulation as the cause of death. The absence of physical evidence doesn't necessarily mean Floyd didn't die from asphyxiation, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned. Gupta also said an officer should have started CPR after one of them told the others he couldn't find a pulse. CNN has reached out to the former officer's attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.",0.0

Police and protesters clashed in Brooklyn on Friday night, with more than 200 protesters arrested. De Blasio appeared on WNYC for his weekly Q&A and responded to questions from reporters about his own administration’s failings, particularly in dealing with police violence. “The anger out there is real and unfortunately, very justified,” de Blasio said. “I really believe that the NYPD knows how to handle protests and respect whoever is protesting, but I want to see a light touch because people are undeniably angry for a reason.” WHITE HOUSE BRIEFLY LOCKED DOWN AS UNREST SPREADS TO ATLANTA, DC, NYC AFTER FLOYD DEATH The comments quickly circulated social media, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) of NYC, which boasts a membership of “approx. 13,000 active and retired sergeants of the NYPD,” directly criticizing the mayor. “If Mayor DeBlasio wants a light touch then let him stand in front and take the first brick to the face. Or perhaps he can sit in a police vehicle and catch the Malatov Cocktail that’s thrown into it,” the SBA tweeted. “Here’s the light touch, DeBlasio brain!” De Blasio has made only a few comments, with his first on Friday not directly addressing the situation but merely saying there will need to be a “review.” “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn. Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe,” de Blasio tweeted late Friday. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” De Blasio has separately criticized President Trump, citing an “uptick in tension and hatred and division since [Trump] came along.” However, the mayor has yet to recognize the difficulties his administration has faced regarding how it responds to issues with the police. While the mayor responds in support of protesters, his administration is often slow to react to controversy. It was under de Blasio’s administration — before President Trump even took office – that the deaths of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley occurred, two of the several incidents that inspired the Black Lives Matter movement.

The rapper and businessman pointed to Atlanta's civil rights history as the home of Martin Luther King Jr. and others who have struggled for equality over the decades. By Jay Croft, CNN (CNN) -- Killer Mike made an emotional plea for calm Friday night as a protest in Atlanta against police brutality turned violent. The demonstration started peacefully, but some protestors broke storefront windows, torched cars and vandalized CNN headquarters. Atlanta was one of several US cities that witnessed protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. ""I am the son of an Atlanta police officer,"" said the rapper and activist, who was joined at a press conference by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Police Chief Erika Shields and fellow Atlanta rap star T.I. ""My cousin is an Atlanta city police officer. And my other cousin an East Point police officer."" ""And I got a lot of love and respect for police officers, down to the original eight police officers in Atlanta,"" he said, an apparent reference to the city's first black officers, hired in 1948, who he said were forced to dress in a separate building because white officers rejected them. LIVE UPDATES ON PROTESTS Killer Mike and T.I. pointed to Atlanta's civil rights history as the home of Martin Luther King Jr. and others who have struggled for equality over the decades. ""I watched a white police officer assassinate a black man,"" Killer Mike said while crying, referring to Floyd's death. ""And I know that tore your heart out."" The officer, since fired, is seen in a video with his knee on Floyd's neck. He has been charged with murder and manslaughter. ""I am duty-bound to be here to simply say that it is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy,"" Killer Mike said. ""It is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organization."" ""It is time to beat up prosecutors you don't like at the voting booth,"" he added, as he wore a T-shirt that read ""Kill Your Masters,"" a lyric from one of his rap group's songs.

Her ""I can't breathe"" attack touched a nerve as both Floyd and Eric Garner -- both unarmed black men -- uttered that expression moments before they died, while facing what many believe was excessive force by police.

As one major protest intensified, Democratic Mayor James Kenney announced a “mandatory curfew” set to begin at 8 p.m. ET through early Sunday morning. A reportedly peaceful Center City demonstration of about 500 calling for “Justice for George Floyd” assembled in the afternoon and moved northwest toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art, according to local FOX affiliate WTXF. However, a separate protest later materialized in Penn Square, home to City Hall, and turned increasingly violent. The iconic statue of famed former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced and CBS3 video from the scene showed protesters concentrating in the public courtyard in the center of City Hall, where some demonstrators climbed atop glass fixtures near the SEPTA subway entrance. Rizzo, who came from a storied Philadelphia family, served as mayor in the 1970s during which he was praised for his devotion to public service. The outspoken Rizzo, however, also served as the city’s police commissioner for several years and has been criticized for his fraught relationship with the African-American community during that time. Not far from City Hall, at least a dozen storefronts along the popular Chestnut and Walnut Street corridors were either looted or defaced, and several Philadelphia Police Department vehicles were reportedly set ablaze in the vicinity — as well as one Pennsylvania State Police cruiser, according to CBS3. Manuel Smith, an editor for the CBS affiliate also tweeted video of a Starbucks engulfed in flames on Dilworth Plaza — which sits along the west rampart of City Hall. In remarks on Twitter Saturday evening, Mayor Kenney said he appreciated the message of the peaceful demonstrations that occurred earlier in the afternoon, but condemned the conflagration in Center City. “The peaceful protests earlier were touching showings of our collective grief,” Kenney wrote. “The anger being displayed now cannot continue. Please have respect and dignity for each other and return home.” Shortly after that post, Kenney retweeted the police department’s message announcing the mayoral-imposed curfew. The Police Department echoed Kenney’s sentiment about the earlier protest at the Art Museum, but declared some of the protesters in Center City as committing “criminal acts.” “Those acts will not be tolerated, and we strongly encourage everyone to refrain from entering Center City. We will continue [to] provide updates throughout the evening,” the Department said in a statement on social media. As the evening continued, police officers in riot gear reportedly confronted a crowd near the Municipal Services Building at 16th and Arch Streets, according to FOX-29. Officers were said to have pressed the crowd back as they threw projectiles and trying to push through the line of police by using a fence. The affiliate also reported through a source that one armed man was arrested in area and charged with firearms violations. In the surrounding suburbs, smaller protests cropped up, including one several miles to the south in Delaware. A group of peaceful demonstrators outside Wilmington, the state’s largest city, were able to temporarily block off a stretch of Interstate 95. FOX-29 photos showed protesters holding signs and blocking vehicular egress. North of Philadelphia, another peaceful protest materialized at the Rose Garden in Bethlehem, Pa., which is also about 70 miles west of New York City. Demonstrators objecting to police brutality marched east along Broad Street toward Payrow Plaza in the center of the Christmas City — which contains City Hall, the police department and city library — according to Lehigh Valley Live. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” were heard as the group moved toward downtown Bethlehem. The demonstrators remained peaceful, the outlet reported, though an intersection on New Street was temporarily blocked by demonstrators. An organizer of the Bethlehem Protest, Matty Fall, told LehighValleyLive that the group did not agree with the violence being seen in other cities. “We don’t condone it at all,” Fall said. “We’re really just trying to get the message across that this can’t keep happening.”",0.0

Within days, protests spread across the country, and protesters and police clashed in Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

Firefighters struggled to break through the protest crowds to extinguish the fire before it could deal more damage. While protests started peacefully on Saturday, it was not long before Los Angeles protesters set several cars on fire — as many as five by the middle of the afternoon. Philadelphia tipped over into violence after protesters were able to get ahold of a vehicle and burn it. Images across social media showed cop vehicles in various cities, either destroyed or burning.

Officers, some in riot gear, moved outward from the Allen County Courthouse and moved protesters along, many of whom broke into smaller groups later in the day, according to FWPD spokesperson Sofia Rosales-Scatena.

Authorities late Saturday night said a Philadelphia police officer was struck by a car in Center City, according to FOX 29 of Philadelphia. ANOTHER NIGHT OF RIOTS ERUPT IN US AS PROTESTERS, POLICE CLASH IN NYC, PHILLY, CHICAGO The officer was taken to Jefferson Hospital and was in stable condition, but reportedly suffered a broken arm and other injuries. Earlier Saturday night, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said 13 police officers suffered injuries “while attempting to control crowds, make arrests, prevent property breaches, and other acts of vandalism.” Outlaw said the officers were injured “as the result of liquid and solid projectiles being hurled at them.” Protests in Center City turned violent, as individuals “committed numerous acts of vandalism and violence,” Outlaw said. TEXAS JOINS SEVERAL OTHER STATES IN MOBILIZING NATIONAL GUARD AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH “The actions of those persons were unlawful and were not in furtherance of any ethical issue or cause,” she said. Outlaw added that during the protests Saturday evening, at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney implemented a mandatory citywide curfew starting at 8 p.m. and lasting until 6 a.m. as protests turned violent Saturday. The protests and riots broke out across the nation after Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody Monday. An employee at a grocery store called police and accused Floyd of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd, who is black, was then arrested and handcuffed by Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, and pushed to the ground.

Bystanders say they also heard shouting at Chauvin to take his knee off of Floyd’s neck. Floyd, 46, died in police custody Monday night.

But they also discussed feelings of resentment and anger many feel about police brutality and the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. ""There are far too many incidents of people being victims of police brutality,"" said Raymond Dix, Jr., pastor of Fort Wayne's Pilgrim Baptist Church. ""We must come together as a community, we must come together with our police, we must say we must review your tactics and the things you do. But we must drive home the point that those who want to promote violence in our community are not part of the ethic of our community."" Friday's protest began as a peaceful rally over the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the demonstration turned into chaos later in the evening as the crowd swelled, blocking traffic and throwing objects at officers stationed in the roadway. Tear gas and pepper spray was used several times to disperse the crowd. Much of the property damage, involving smashed windows and graffiti, occurred late in the night, after police fired tear gas, as the crowd shifted southwest from Clinton Street to the intersection of Wayne and Calhoun. Anger was on full display – something that was not lost on Stephen Terry, pastor of New Life Church of God and his son. Both attended Friday's demonstration. ""My son, when a little tear gas hit him, he said, 'Dad, I'm angry' and he's a peaceful young man,"" Terry said. The Black community has a long history of facing systemic racism, Terry said, and many feel that struggle has fallen on deaf ears and ""at some point, your silence becomes betrayal."" ""The beautiful thing that I see, though, is we got a chance, I think we have a small window of opportunity to recognize that we are not going to ignore the voice,"" Terry said. Black men and women nationwide are angry and tired ""of being wounded, of our bodies not being important,"" Dix said. He also called on white evangelicals ""to stand with us."" ""This is not a journey for one group over another. This is a journey that we must take together and if we're willing to take this journey together, we can make this country better."" As the unrest grew, attention to the intended message of Friday's protest was lost, City Councilwoman Michelle Chambers, D-at large, said. The discussion Saturday, she noted, focused mostly on property damage. ""We are defeating our whole purpose in protesting,"" Chambers said. ""What happened last night made us lose the message of the wrong, why they were gathering. An innocent man was murdered on television ... but nobody knows that anymore."" What happened Friday is a distraction, Dix said, ""from the very issues of systemic injustice that have plagued our communities for far too long."" Councilwoman Sharon Tucker, D-6th, agreed. A peaceful protest morphing into chaotic property destruction is ""never welcome,"" she said, and creates ""a narrative that could have a negative impact on my community and that hurts me deeply."" ""I appreciate, so much, the people of all different nationalities that came out and stood beside the African American community in support,"" Tucker said. ""But I am so disappointed in those individuals who took a peaceful, positive expression of emotion and turned it into a negative destruction of property."" Police have said they believe most of the people who caused Friday's destruction were out-of-towners who attended the rally intending to cause trouble. In total, 29 people were arrested, most of whom were charged with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. Reached for comment Saturday, City Council President Tom Didier, R-3rd, said he was still trying to grasp what transpired. However, Didier said he was ""truly disappointed with the behavior."" Didier also said by-and-large, the Fort Wayne Police Department is made up of ""some of the finest police officers in the state."" He called Police Chief Steve Reed ""an excellent police chief."" ""He cares about the city, he cares about his officers and he cares about the neighborhoods in the surrounding areas,"" Didier said. ""I can tell you the man has integrity. He is forthright, he has vision in how to help and the biggest thing is he truly, truly cares."" What happened in Minnesota is unconscionable, Didier said, and is something that should never happen in Fort Wayne. To that end, Didier said he would support creating a coalition to discuss police-related issues in the community, should Mayor Tom Henry choose to do so. Councilman Geoff Paddock, D-5th, who represents the downtown area, said that while everyone supports the constitutional right to peacefully assemble, ""everyone involved in such action has to draw the line at vandalism and property destruction."" There will be an opportunity to evaluate Friday's events – perhaps at a City Council meeting soon, Paddock said, adding that he hopes demonstrators continue to assemble peacefully in the future. dgong@jg.net",0.0

Tia Piotrowski stood south of the Allen County Courthouse, and her eyes were red. She and a friend came to downtown Fort Wayne to protest the killings of people of color by police around the country, they said. Each said children were in the crowd when local officers used the noxious gas. Nearby, Taylor Frey said he threw a tear gas canister back at police. His eyes also were watery and red, and I saw him later using milk to ease the stinging in his eyes and the burning on his hands. “I've been part of a couple (protests),” he told me, “but nothing like this.” Neither have I. I've been a journalist about 20 years and covered everything from aspects of 9/11 to the county fair. I've been to homicide scenes and once arrived to a typically quiet neighborhood where a 2-year-old boy had just been struck and killed by a car. In 2007, I snapped photographs as a group of neo-Nazis marched through Columbia, Missouri, as counterprotesters shouted them down and police held positions on rooftops. Even in those sometimes tense situations, there was an odd sense of normality. The story had a beginning, a middle and an end. The neo-Nazis arrived, they marched, police maintained order, and the whole thing was over. But Fort Wayne was not normal Friday. The first sign – when some people began taunting and screaming at police – occurred hours after the start of a planned, and until that point peaceful, protest, and there was chaos at times. Tyler Weber, 23, of Wabash was sitting in the road at Clinton and Berry streets when he was enveloped by white smoke – the gas. Others gathered there rushed to him and flushed his eyes with water. As I moved toward Weber from my place on the sidewalk, a canister was fired and bounced inches from my feet. Soon, I couldn't see and felt the need to vomit. Neither I nor reporters near me heard a warning from officers, although Police Chief Steve Reed said at a news conference Saturday that protesters were warned multiple times. When I went home about two hours later, I slumped on the couch and tried to figure out the day's events. I'm still not sure I can make sense of everything. But I hope things get better.

And, for the guys that I have worked with my whole life to try to help them become the men I believe they were created to be.” After discussing his desire to speak his mind with Hoosiers athletic director Fred Glass, Allen expressed his opinion on Twitter, citing a Bible verse – John 15:12, “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you” – and adding: “My heart is broken by what is going on in our country. Racial injustice is wrong and it MUST be addressed!! I Believe we are to LOVE EACH OTHER! No matter one's skin color. Love is a choice. Our prayers are with George Floyd's family.” Allen has built his program at Indiana around the phrase “Love Each Other,” making LEO the IU football slogan. It was therefore unsurprising he was one of the first coaches to speak out about the protests. By Saturday, coaches and players from across college and professional sports had added their thoughts to the chorus of voices calling for change. “Enough! Senseless loss of life, violence, unrest and continued racial injustice. My voice should have been heard earlier, but I was at a loss for words,” Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly wrote Saturday morning on Twitter. “My thoughts and prayers go out to the Floyd family and all those affected by prior injustice. I lend my support to be a solution and stand with all those committed to change.” One of Kelly's former players, linebacker Drue Tranquill, a Carroll graduate who now plays for the Los Angeles Chargers, expressed dismay at the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck as Floyd said he could not breathe. “Sickening. RIP George Floyd – my heart literally aches after what I just watched,” Tranquill wrote on Twitter. “Still deeply grieving and confused by what's taken place,” he added Saturday. “These aren't just videos, they are lives. Lives ended by complete injustice.” The protests that took place in Louisville, Kentucky, on Friday were not only about Floyd but also about city resident Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in her home as the officers served a search warrant. As those protests were getting underway, Snider graduate and Louisville Cardinals men's basketball player Malik Williams added his thoughts to the situation. “Take a chance. Make a change,” tweeted Williams. “Be safe. Stay Dangerous. Love is love.” Later, he appended advice for those who have been frustrated by some of the conversation online. “Get off social media,” wrote Williams, who is a Louisville team captain. “The opinions being voiced are just adding fire to the fuel.” As the protests continued Saturday, more coaches made their opinions known. Purdue basketball coach Matt Painter said the events of the previous few weeks make clear that “we have a lot of work to do when it comes to race and racism in this country.” He expressed anger and sadness and added a commitment to continuing to “lead, teach and educate” his team. “I will never know what it is like to move through this world as a black person in America and I can't pretend to know what the answers are,” Painter wrote on Twitter. “What I do know is that I want to be part of the solution and I believe that the adversity and prejudice that black people in America face is something we all must address and seek to remedy – together.” Ball State football coach Mike Neu said that the video of Floyd's death “broke my heart” and that he supported his players and staff as they expressed themselves in the aftermath. He pointed out that sports can help teach lessons about equality and fairness. “I grew up playing sports with teammates from all different races and backgrounds,” Neu wrote on Twitter. “Sports always reaffirmed to me that all men and women are created equal regardless of color. ... I have always believed that you treat others how you want to be treated. I was and am fortunate to be involved in sports where I can eat, sleep and breathe just the same as all of my players and staff.” As more college coaches – a group that is generally reluctant to discuss current events outside of their programs – released statements condemning Floyd's death or calling for change, former Notre Dame forward and three-time ACC Defensive Player of the Year Brianna Turner urged recruits making their college decisions to take note of who was speaking and who was not. “Recruits deciding what school they want to attend – please be vigilant right now,” Turner tweeted. “See what coaches are speaking out now and what coaches aren't. Think about if you would feel comfortable speaking about current issues with your coach. Would they be open or reject such a discussion? “For me playing at ND (it) was important that I had an outspoken leader in Coach (Muffet) McGraw. The women's basketball team was one of the most racially diverse teams on campus. I could not imagine how different my experience would have been if she wasn't open to those harsher convos.” dsinn@jg.net",0.0

Trump, who earlier belittled the protesters, pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.” Across from the White House, police lined up in front of the protesters, forming a human barricade as Trump returned to the White House from his Florida trip. Protesters chanted and taunted the police. Witnesses said there were multiple incidents of protesters pushing against the barricades and being repelled with pepper spray. “We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. Earlier, speaking over a megaphone, Cameron McCall said, “We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.” The mood was angry but decidedly non-violent with several speakers imploring marchers to remain peaceful. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to vicious dogs revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks gross and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day's protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city's thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. • In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. Police handcuffed the driver but did not release his name or say whether he would face charges. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV's windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they made arrests and cleared streets. Another video showed two NYPD cruisers driving into protesters who were pushing a barricade against a police car and pelting it with objects, knocking several to the ground. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan's Foley Square. “This is the only way we're going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don't condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state's National Guard and promised a massive show of force. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” More than a dozen major cities nationwide imposed overnight curfews. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight.",0.0

Two officers had minor injuries, and several citizens also reported injuries Friday night, though police did not have information on the nature of those injuries, according to police spokeswoman Sofia Rosales-Scatena. Twenty-nine protesters were arrested Friday and being held at Allen County Jail without bail under the direction and authority of an unnamed Allen County judge, Sheriff David Gladieux and city Police Chief Steve Reed said. Reed and Gladieux joined Mayor Tom Henry, Fort Wayne United Executive Director Iric Headley, and local pastors Luther Whitfield and Robert Bell to take to the microphone Saturday morning at Citizens Square to express dismay at the violence, but also to insist the demonstration did not represent Fort Wayne. “What we experienced last night was not Fort Wayne,” Henry said, visibly upset and insistent that the trouble came from elsewhere. “They came here to cause trouble. It got out of hand because a few individuals decided that they wanted to take it to the next level.” More than 50 downtown windows were smashed about 10 p.m. Friday, hours after a peaceful protest against police violence and, in particular, Monday's death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. Floyd could be heard in a video saying “I Can't Breathe” as he lay in the street nearly face down. Reed said more than 100 Fort Wayne officers were involved in an hourslong local demonstration that turned violent after tear gas was deployed against some protesters who refused to follow police directions to clear Clinton and Berry streets. Protesters threw water bottles and rocks, he said, and were climbing on to cars that became clogged in the streets around the Allen County Courthouse. Crowd estimates were difficult to make, as protesters were spread out on multiple blocks downtown and the situation changed rapidly. Rosales-Scatena estimated Friday's crowd to be 300 to 400 people and Saturday's crowd size at 200 to 300 people, though Gladieux estimated Saturday's crowd size between 1,200 and 1,500. Similar demonstrations occurred in other cities including Indianapolis and Atlanta on Friday, as they had on recent nights in Minneapolis. Gladieux said the Allen County Sheriff's Department had between 35 and 40 sheriff's deputies also working to control the escalating violence that included large stone planters overturned. Most of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and failure to exit an emergency area, Gladieux said. They could be discharged after a court appearance that would not occur until Monday when courts open. On Saturday morning, more than 100 volunteers showed up to help clean the glass and dirt from the city streets that included Calhoun, Wayne, Berry, Webster and Harrison streets, according to police. More than 100 Fort Wayne police officers were on hand for Friday night's demonstration. The Allen County Sheriff's Department had about 35 to 40 officers on the scene, along with Indiana State Police. Reed said protesters were given multiple warnings to clear the traffic obstruction before tear gas was used, which outraged many of those gathered. Two demonstrations that had been scheduled for Saturday, including one at 2 p.m., were canceled, Reed said, though protesters still showed up. Michael Galbraith, executive director of the Downtown Improvement District, said his organization had brooms and dustpans on hand but many volunteers brought their own. Galbraith estimated the cost of replacing the 50 windows at between $200 and $500 apiece. One of those wielding a broom and dust pan was Ty VanMeter of Fort Wayne. “Local businesses should not be hurt by the bad actions of a very few,” VanMeter said. jduffy@jg.net",0.0

Arrests were also made but police had not released how many as of Saturday night. Allen County Sheriff's Department officers and Indiana State Police aided Fort Wayne, most of them in riot gear, chasing protesters from one intersection to the next, and setting off flash-bang and canisters of tear gas so often the streets took on a smoky haze. Police expected trouble and Police Chief Steve Reed said earlier Saturday the department was ready. There were few signs of any officers at 2 p.m. when protesters arrived at the Allen County Courthouse for their “I Can't Breathe” rally, even though at least two events had been canceled. Sheriff David Gladieux estimated between 1,200 and 1,500 protesters showed up Saturday, about the same number that filled the courthouse green Friday night. However, police spokeswoman Sofia Rosales-Scatena estimated there were only 200 to 300 people at Saturday's rally. The crowd got larger and louder, but underwent a remarkable change when members of the Church of God in Warsaw brought out a mic and allowed protesters to speak. The racially integrated church had been singing hymns on the courthouse green and mingling with the crowd. But the crowd grew restless and angrier and moved to confront a barricade of Allen County sheriff's vehicles in front of the courthouse. Shortly after, people got quiet and listened when some got the chance to speak and explain why they were there and how they felt about the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by a white Minneapolis police officer Monday. “I love that everybody came back today. They can stand there all day sweating in their military outfits,” one man told the crowd, pointing to sheriff's deputies standing beside the vehicles and drawing a laugh. Ray Tinsman, leader of the Church of God members who all wore black and white collars, said the congregation came in peace. “The issue is bigger than can be addressed by government,” Tinsman said as he and his people left the courthouse about 4 p.m. At that time, people were sitting on the courthouse lawn and relaxing, some eating ice cream from a shop up Main Street. Without a longer program, the crowd reassembled on Clinton Street and started to tie up the intersection. The Fort Wayne SWAT team arrived, and gave out a verbal warning that the assembly was no longer lawful, followed by the first of many assaults with pepper spray. Some protesters ran west on Main Street and others south on Clinton Street, effectively splitting the group in two. Officers clad in riot gear marched west on Clinton and over the courthouse green, continuing to spray tear gas. Standoffs occurred at Clinton and Harrison streets and Clinton and Berry, devolving over several hours into a cat and mouse game. If the protesters headed north on Clinton Street to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge, police followed, blockading intersections and deploying tear gas. The atmosphere was tense outside Citizens Square shortly after 5:30 p.m. and protesters cleared the streets after several warnings from police, moving to the nearby sidewalk. Police in riot gear stood silently, some holding clubs, as protesters, many of them silent as well, stared back. A lone man on a bicycle hurled insults and criticisms at the assembled officers before leaving the area, while another walked through the intersection, collecting trash into a plastic bag. About 9 p.m., rubber bullets were used along with tear gas at a parking lot next to the Subway on Clinton Street. Corey Davis and Easton Curvin, young men from Fort Wayne, held tear gas canisters that had been shot up into the air in a seemingly indiscriminate pattern to disperse a small crowd at Clinton and Wayne streets. Police then walked west on Washington Street, with one officer falling in a cloud of tear gas. He was quickly helped up by another officer, as the tear gas got thicker and heavier. At one point, blue smoke from tear gas drifted across the I&M Plaza making for surreal and dramatic scene as night fell. Davis and Curvin said the death of Floyd was one thing, but the feeling was “deeper than that,” Curvin said. He knew of three people in Fort Wayne who were shot dead by police, including Shaquille Kelly, killed last May by a Gang Unit officer on the city's south side. Davis said Saturday that both of them were aware of people who appeared to be “instigators” and saw them spit on people. Mayor Tom Henry and law enforcement blamed people from outside Fort Wayne for inciting Friday's night violence and vandalism. “That's how you divide up people; instigate from within,” Davis said. As the night closed in, the protesters, all of them described as “20-somethings” by an officer over the police scanner, traveled in pockets over the city streets, avoiding police whenever possible. Each turn tear gas was sprayed, they rendered first aid with milk and water to ease the pain that burned the eyes and face. jduffy@jg.net Dave Gong contributed to this story.",0.0

The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general’s offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. “Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,” the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon’s largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters “harshly condemned” a white police officer’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting “No justice, no peace.” It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd’s death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as “I can’t breathe” and “The Real Virus is Racism.” Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city’s police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri — Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an “unlawful assembly” and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee’s activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. “We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,” Inslee said in a statement. “But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.” ___ WASHINGTON — Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd’s death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, “What are you looting a coffee shop for? You’re messing up the whole message.” ___ NEW YORK — The mayor of New York City’s own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn’t mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn’t have an immediate comment. — By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas — Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn’t have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER — Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of “Don’t shoot” alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters “reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.” ___ PHOENIX — Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. “Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,” Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers’ use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON — As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were “intentionally set” around the city. One was at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, “until the present,” has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, “the church of presidents.” The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON — The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation’s capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman — about 1,200 soldiers — to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. – By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd’s death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Michael Jordan is “deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.” With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. “I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,” the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand’s social media accounts and the team’s Twitter account. “I see and feel everyone’s pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. “I don’t have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. “My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.” ___ BOSTON — A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence “criminal and cowardly” in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA — Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON — Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That’s according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. — By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

1621318300,2020-05-31 01:30:43,Perspectives: WANE 15 reporters reflect on day two of downtown protests,https://www.wane.com/top-stories/perspectives-wane-15-reporters-reflect-on-day-two-of-downtown-protests/,en,False,,94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) — As Fort Wayne protests spurred by the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd continued on Saturday, WANE 15 provided team coverage of the situation throughout the day. Although several crews reported on the protest downtown throughout the day, two crews remained late Saturday evening. WANE 15’s Britt Salay first arrived downtown around 1:00 pm to cover a press conference held by church leaders in the area urging people to protest peacefully after Friday night protests left some downtown businesses with damage. The men who spoke urged protestors to stay peaceful and respectful of city property but also asked those not protesting to understand that there is a lot of anger in the country right now. Protestors started trickling on to the Allen County Courthouse lawn, around 30 minutes ahead of the planned start time of 2:00 pm. According to Salay, although hundreds of protestors came out, it seemed to be contained to the courthouse lawn. She reported seeing signs many signs, some that read “I can’t breathe”, “White supremacy is terrorism”, and “Black Lives Matter”. At some point, police began shutting down Main and Clinton Streets, preventing any cars from driving past the protestors, people began walking in street and on the sidewalk going east on Main St. to get to a road with cars driving by. After protestors went around the block, Clinton St. was opened back up and people continued protesting from the sidewalks and the courthouse lawn until just before 5:00 pm, when people started stepping into the streets. The situation continued to escalate until all lanes of Clinton between Main and Berry Sts. were shut down. It was at this point that the first tear gas cannisters were deployed. From then, people dispersed but many started making their way to the Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge further up on Clinton St. At first, it was quiet compared to the situation that led up to the tear gas. People sat in the street with their signs while others stood and shared messages of change. However, a large group of other protestors made their way to the bridge as well. Eventually, people started breaking off into smaller groups and making their way back to the center of the city. Salay and WANE 15’s J.R. Carmichael and Chris Darby stayed east of Clinton as people attempted to make their way back to the area of the courthouse and Citizens Square. It became a cycle of quiet moments followed by cars honking, people chanting and shouting, and then more tear gas drops. Wind would push the tear gas as much as a block away from the drop site. The crew, now just Carmichael and Salay, walked to the Wendy’s near Jefferson Blvd. and Clinton St. where they saw that one of the windows had been smashed out. They did not notice any other visible damage to that building or others as they continued west but did see police arresting a man a couple of blocks away. Salay said the group sizes continued to shrink as short boom sounds seemed to become more frequent. At one point, she and Carmichael attempted to meet up with WANE 15’s Breann Boswell and Colton Howard over by the Jimmy John’s restaurant at Calhoun and Wayne Sts., but as they were walking across One Summit Square, officers began deploying several tear gas canisters, some which landed just feet away from protestors and the reporters. Salay and Boswell both reported seeing a flash of red light as well, but could not identify the source any further than saying it was not police lights. Salay and Carmichael retreated with the crowd until they found a quiet area to take a break, but after a few minutes of sitting on the curb, a tear gas canister landed right at their feet. Salay said the effects from this canister were far worse than the others she had encountered because of the close proximity, and that she could barely keep her eyes open to run away from it. At the same time on the other side of Calhoun, Boswell and Howard were experiencing the effects of tear gas that had been thrown. Boswell said crowds on the street had been gassed about six times. It was impossible for her to talk and breathe. Loud booms kept ringing out and at the time Boswell couldn’t depict what exactly those were. As Boswell and Howard reported on Wayne St. they witnessed a female holding a sign stating “Black Lives Matter” standing up to multiple police officers who were making attempts to send her home. She walked backward for the length of a block holding her sign as police attempted to get her off the streets. Crowds dispersed from Wayne Street but began to gather off of Calhoun. Multiple officers arrived and quickly exited the van and arrested a female. Another female was thrown to the ground and arrested by officers while she was crying and pleading to not be arrested. At this point in time officers were pointing gas at bystanders telling them to go home or they would be arrested. Both of these females did not resist their arrest. As these arrests were taking place, bystanders and people who were driving on the street were throwing water bottles at the scene. A group of people who witnessed this began following around Boswell and Howard with the hope that being with the news, the cops would not make threats. People were hiding behind and grabbing Boswell attempting to protect themselves as she was giving live reports of what was going on. After this situation dispersed, Boswell and Howard then walked to Jefferson Blvd. and Clinton St. where tear gas was once again being set off by officers. At the corner of the street, four females were sitting on the curb in handcuffs. Multiple cars were passing by honking and screaming out their windows and holding out their fists. Protesters gathered to witness these females in custody. While they were there, they spoke to someone who said from their experience Saturday, the situation had died down from earlier in the evening. The witness also stated that he hoped this would go on for as long as it needed to. While the interview was going on police officers dispersed the scene by proclaiming from their vehicles that “you need to be dispersed and go home or you will be arrested.” Bystanders were anticipating tear gas again, so they left for another location. At this point, both crews made the decision to go to locations on opposite sides of the city, with less commotion to wrap up coverage and prepare for Nightcast. Loud booms could be heard leading up their live reports, with Salay reporting things quieted down on the east side of town while Boswell said the booms and shouting continued as she left the area.",0.0

A truck driver drove into demonstrators in Minneapolis nearly a week after George Floyd pleaded with an officer pressing a knee into his neck that he could not breathe.

Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. By midnight, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department had confirmed one fatality, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. Commentary: Indianapolis in troubled times: 'Why are you crying? More: Business leaders call for an end to looting IMPD deemed Downtown unsafe and asked residents to stay away from the area, even as fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and, in some cases, banks and other businesses. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice — No Peace."" The Saturday demonstrations followed a tense night Friday in Indianapolis, where crowds of people marched Downtown to protest police shootings, including the killings of Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and, most recently, George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said the protests that started Friday and continued until about 4 a.m. Saturday resulted in 27 arrests and damage to at least 30 business, including a CVS that was looted and sustained fire damage. It's unclear how many arrests were made and businesses damaged Saturday night and into the Sunday morning hours. A peaceful demonstration turns into something else The slow-rolling protest Saturday elicited a mix of cheers and jeers from motorists, bystanders and people watching the action unfold live on social media. Police took a hands off approach until just after sunset, when a confrontation occurred at Market and Alabama streets, where protesters blocked the road in front of a line of squad cars. “This is no longer a lawful assembly. You are subject to arrest,"" an officer told protesters several times over a public address system. Most of the protesters held their position blocking the road. An IndyStar reporter at the scene saw 10 officers and four police cars. Most were wearing gas masks and standing still. One protester threw a water bottle at an officer, and several others followed. Officers then began firing tear gas. Many of the protesters scattered from the area and retreated further back in the streets. At a late night media briefing IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor condemned the violence and said officers had been working very well with the protest organizers earlier in the day. “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests,"" Taylor said in a prepared statement. ""Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings."" He continued: ""Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD."" Officials urged peaceful assembly In the wake of the conflict and violence less than 24 hours earlier, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett issued statements urging those returning Downtown for the two Saturday protests to refrain from violence and vandalism. Hogsett said he also asked organizers to conclude the events by 7 p.m. and encourage participants to leave the Downtown area after that time. It all went according to plan, at least initially. Police said there were no arrests or major issues when the second protest formally ended at 7 p.m. But few in the crowd — a mix of mostly young blacks and whites, many wearing masks — appeared to heed warnings to leave from organizers. Instead the crowd continued to snake through city street north and east of monument circle for nearly two hours before the standoff near the northeast corner of the City-County Building. The feelings of racial injustice fueling the protests extend far beyond Indianapolis and Indiana, said Deziree Walker, a native of Griffith, Indiana, and former IUPUI student who marched with the protesters Saturday. ""Seeing what's been going on for years and years and years, we're tired. We're exhausted,"" she explained. ""We want change. That's why we're here today."" Indy joins cities around the nation The local protests are part of a nationwide eruption of unrest that has drawn throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities, including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Some cities have seen five days of protests. In Indianapolis, Taylor said five IMPD vehicles were damaged and three officers and three civilians were injured Friday night and early Saturday morning, including a person who sustained what Taylor characterized as ""severe lacerations"" while kicking glass. As some protesters grew unruly, police in riot gear launched tear gas canisters and shot pepper balls in an effort to break up the crowd. Just after midnight, police said, someone fired shots at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy outside 1 American Square. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire. No suspect has been arrested. Demonstrators returned Downtown Saturday afternoon for the first of two planned protests. As they gathered at the Indiana Convention Center, city workers and private crews hustled to block off several streets and place sheets of plywood over ground-floor windows. Both events Saturday were publicized on social media by local organizers who urged participants to refrain from violence. At 5;30 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 gathered at the Indiana War Memorial began moving to Monument Circle chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice — No peace"" and ""Hands up — Don't shot."" At the circle, a protester spray-painted BLM, for black lives matter, on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Earlier, about 100 demonstrators began gathering around 1 p.m. at the convention center for an event promoted as a show of solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. It was organized by Indianapolis resident Malik Muhammad. About 50 people from that event moved north to the war memorial for the second protest at 4 p.m. They marched north amid chants of ""What do we want — body cams"" and ""when do we want them — now."" The second protest, which focused on the shooting of Reed, was organized by Indianapolis resident Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student. She called for the release of an autopsy report and the names of officers involved in the May 6 shooting. ""There has been no justice for his case,"" Brown said through a bullhorn. ""And there will never be justice for his case."" The crowd quickly swelled from a few hundred to an estimated 2,000 or more. Brown said the event, which had been set to end at sunset, or 9:05 p.m., would instead end at 7 p.m. Anything that happens after that, Brown said, is not affiliated with her event. She urged the crowd to remain nonviolent, and warned that IMPD had told her that it could use force to clear the streets after 7 p.m. Brown's message echoed statements earlier Saturday from Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Both issued public statements acknowledging the right to demonstrate, but urging participants to remain peaceful and refrain from vandalism or looting. Hogsett said he met Saturday morning to discuss the protests with representatives of Indy10 Black Lives Matter and the mother of Reed, 21, who was shot and killed by IMPD officers earlier this month after a police chase he recorded on Facebook Live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say he fired a weapon. As he ran, the officer first attempted to tase him, then shot. The shooting is under investigated. The mayor said he made commitments to ""continued change"" in the areas of community policing, transparency and police accountability, including implementing body cameras and a new use-of-force review board. ""We must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless,"" he said. Hogsett added he hoped demonstrations would conclude by 7 p.m. The mayor said he asked the organizers to instruct demonstrators to return to their homes at that time. ""I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,"" he said. ""But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love."" The Mayor took to Twitter at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to condemn the violence. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" Hogsett's social media post said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" The Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement calling for an end to the violence. ""The opportunity to succeed is central to the growth of Indianapolis, and significant barriers including systemic racism threaten this opportunity,"" said CEO Michael Huber. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change. When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury.""

1621397124,2020-05-31 05:00:13,Tuesday's largely mail-in primary  in Indiana is shaping up to be unique,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/625670904/0/indystar/allnews~Tuesdays-largely-mailin-primary-in-Indiana-is-shaping-up-to-be-unique/,en,False,,85390,blogs.indystar.com,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider,"Tuesday's primary will be unlike any we've seen in Indiana. It's a good bet more than half of you will have cast your ballots by the time the polls open, due to the expansion of absentee voting amid coronavirus concerns. Many of you who do venture out Tuesday will find fewer polling places, workers wearing protective gear and lines stretching out longer than they look due to social distancing. There's cause to worry some of those absentee ballots will arrive too late to be counted. With an increasing number of Marion County voters complaining their ballots arrived late this week or haven't come at all, Clerk Myla Eldridge sent a letter Thursday to the Secretary of State urging the Indiana Election Commission extend the deadline to receive ballots back by mail. She says it's clear thousands of voters will be disenfranchised, but at this point, the deadline remains noon Tuesday. In an evolving public spat, Secretary of State Connie Lawson blamed Marion County for a lack of preparation and said she won't change deadlines for one county. While some of those voters who planned to vote absentee might now vote in person, no one is expecting record-shattering turnout because the top-of-the-ticket races are uncontested. President Trump and Joe Biden wrapped up their nominations months ago. Gov. Holcomb is running unopposed for a second term and Dr. Woody Myers' potential Democratic opponents dropped out long ago. The top races for some Hoosiers will be for Congress — especially in the districts of the retiring Susan Brooks and Pete Visclosky. For others, the most interesting names on the ballot will be for county office. Primary voters won't have a say in one of the most compelling races. Former Congressman Todd Rokita has jumped into the mix to replace Attorney General Curtis Hill, an estranged Republican whom Gov. Holcomb has been unable to toss from the ticket. Hill's fate will be decided by Republican state delegates, who will mail in their own votes after the June 18 virtual state convention. Hill won't be the only candidate who will have to wait to learn his fate, though certainly he'll have the longest wait. Many election boards have been warning they don't expect final results Tuesday — especially in larger counties and in competitive Congressional districts that cross political borders. Election workers in many counties will tally all of those absentee ballots into Wednesday and potentially beyond. Now one can say precisely how long before every race has been called. Potentially just a day. Possibly several. At worst, probably a week, though counties have nearly two weeks, until June 12. Also different: The way in which the winners celebrate and launch their November campaigns. While a few candidates are planning small watch parties on Election Night, there will be no rousing victory speeches with packed ballroom parties as a backdrop. No photos of handshakes and high fives from supporters. No touching pictures of hugs and kisses from kids and spouses in front of large crowds. Tuesday, the most likely story will be what it all looked like and how it went. ""I know for my friends who are interested in politics,"" said Robert Dion, a political science professor at the University of Evansville, ""if they sit down on Election Night with a beer and they want to see who's winning, they are not going to know."" 546,000 to vote by mail Roughly 546,000 Hoosiers have requested mail-in ballots in the past few weeks, an extraordinary number 10 times higher than four years ago. In 2016, more than 1.7 million voted in the presidential primary, but only about 53,800 of those by mail. That was a historic night with high turnout. Trump wrapped up his nomination against a lingering Ted Cruz. Bernie Sanders defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, forcing her to continue campaigning for several weeks. Trump won't be here Tuesday. Neither will Biden. Holcomb and Myers aren't planning watch parties. The governor is keeping focused on Indiana's reopening amid the coronavirus. Myers is trying to figure out how to gain traction — and raise cash — without campaigning in person. The last year Indiana had such a ho-hum presidential and gubernatorial primary, in 2012, only some 957,500 Hoosiers voted. President Obama was seeking a second term and Mitt Romney had all but wrapped up the GOP nomination. Mike Pence, at the time a firebrand conservative congressman, and former House Speaker John Gregg were both uncontested in their gubernatorial primaries. There's cause to think Tuesday might produce an even lower turnout than in 2012, perhaps much lower if this election hadn't been buoyed by the option for mail-in voting. Republicans eight years ago had a top of the ticket Senate race — tea party favorite Richard Mourdock's historic defeat of longtime Sen. Richard Lugar. While Democrats in some areas might be especially motivated to vote as a protest to President Trump, pundits think it's most likely only the most reliable voters who will turn out. ""Seniors or those close to being seniors are the ones most likely to vote,"" said Nadia Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University. ""Black women are more likely to turn out. I'm really concerned that those who win on Tuesday will see their winning as a referendum or mandate to govern, and it definitely is not."" Absentee balloting hasn't been all smooth It's difficult to say how absentee balloting will go. There's cause to think the ease of voting will somewhat bolster turnout while protecting folks from COVID-19. That said, there's also reason to think there will be problems. Never before, have as many as half a million Hoosiers voted by mail in one election. That's a lot of ballots to mail out and count. It's hard to say how it will go. In Marion County, about 124,000 want to vote by mail. Clerk Eldridge says her staff has processed 123,000 of those, but she says the post office has taken weeks to deliver many ballots to voters. She said her staff also only had 10 people to process all of those application in the early weeks of the pandemic, a number that's now risen to 100. ""In short,"" she wrote to the Secretary of State, ""this could mean that thousands of ballots will remain uncounted despite the best efforts of the Marion County Election Board and the voters themselves."" The Secretary of State sent a letter back saying Marion County waited too long to shift into high gear and should have reached out sooner for help. ""Lack of prior planning and preparation are no reason to change deadlines,"" she wrote. Judging by the folks who have been reaching out to IndyStar, voters are worried their votes won't be counted. In some cases, they say ballots took weeks to arrive. In other cases, election officials say they never received the applications. Other voters are worried the ballots came so late there won't be time to mail them back. It's left many unsure what to do. Carl Scott, 67, and John Stubblefield, 60, were among several voters who told IndyStar in a story that ran May 19 they had requested but had not received absentee ballots weeks prior. The ballots finally came on May 23, nearly three weeks after the two submitted applications. Marion County received the applications May 7 and mailed them out May 8, according to the clerk's office. It's unclear what happened. ""My concern with all of this is that people may be put in a position where they cannot vote,"" Scott said. ""Eventually I would love to see the whole country being able to vote by mail. Obviously they need to get this worked out."" Such anecdotal stories abound and it's unclear how widespread of an issue that will be in or beyond Marion County. The Secretary of State's Office notes absentee ballots also can be turned into the county clerk's office prior to election day. You also can vote in person, but you'll have to fill out paperwork to confirm you didn't vote absentee. You can check the status of your ballot at www.IndianaVoters.com. ""Because of the high number of absentee ballots in this year’s primary,"" said Secretary of State spokesman Ian Hauer in a news release, ""the U.S. Postal Service is under a high level of strain, and voters may wish to consider alternate methods for returning their ballot."" Most counties required voters to send an application for an absentee ballot. A few mailed absentee ballots to every voter, a strategy that appeared to be effective. Boone County, for example, mailed applications to 46,000 registered voters and about 12,700 responded they will vote by mail. That's more than in both Johnson (about 11,700) and Hendricks (about 10,300) counties, which are each more than twice as populous as Boone. Hamilton County will put aside however many of the nearly 40,000 absentee ballots workers haven't counted at 5 p.m. Tuesday and start again Wednesday morning. To help with social distancing, election officials want to get those workers out of the county judicial center before poll workers finish up and come in. Some counties, like Allen County in Fort Wayne, won't even start counting absentee ballots until Wednesday and have warned it could take days. Allen County mailed out nearly 40,000 ballots, a huge chunk of the potential vote. Keeping things safe Many counties will have far fewer places to vote. Marion County will have 22, instead of the usual 250. St. Joseph County, home of South Bend, will have 12 voting locations. It usually has more than 120. ""With fewer polling places and limited volunteers, long lines are a concern, as is the risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19,"" said Elizabeth Bennion, a politics professor at Indiana University-South Bend. The Secretary of State has sent personal protective equipment such as hand sanitizer, dispenser bottles, disinfectant, microfiber cloths, gloves and masks to local election offices. That office also has asked poll workers to wear masks, wash their hands and sanitize equipment and tables regularly, require social distancing and wear gloves when handling paper. Each county will handle coronavirus concerns in different ways. Many clerks say voters will stand in line spread out by marks on the ground — just like the check out lines at grocery stores. Election officials are asking voters to wear masks and to socially distance, though their lawyers note they cannot require anyone to do so under Indiana law. ""While voters are strongly encouraged to follow CDC guidelines,"" a memo from the Secretary of State to election offices reads, ""such as wearing cloth face coverings and socially distance when in public spaces, coughing or sneezing into their elbow, and regularly washing hands with soap and water (use hand sanitizer), in the view of the Election Division, these cannot be pre-conditions for a voter to cast their ballot on Election Day."" The letter also says election officials can't ban campaign volunteers from appearing outside voting places; you know, the folks wearing candidate buttons and handing out fliers. But you can ask them to stay 6 feet away. ""A voter who feels harassed, endangered or otherwise harmed by a volunteer not heeding to their request should direct matters to local law enforcement,"" the letter says. To avoid the risks, election officials everywhere hope voters got the message — vote by mail. ""I think it's going to be a very slow day when you look at the actual number of people showing up,"" said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics in Fort Wayne. ""I think that it will also be incredibility frustrating because of how slowly results will trickle in."" Contact IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at Chris.Sikich@indystar.com.

Four Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd’s arrest were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving, the Associated Press reported. Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he begged for air, was arrested Friday and charged with murder, according to the AP. Floyd’s death resulted in both peaceful and violent protests in Minneapolis and multiple cities around the country. Late Friday and early Saturday, clashes with the police in Indianapolis prompted officers to fire multiple volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds that shattered storefronts. GALLERY: George Floyd protests in Fort Wayne, Indiana At the protest, participants chanted slogans, held signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for Floyd” and cheered as cars passed by and honked. More people joined the protests as time went by. Jeffery Tompkins, a protestor at the event, said he was riding his bike through Muncie and joined in on the protest. “I’m here not to talk. I’m here just to stand in solidarity with our black brethren who have been systematically and systemically perpetrated violence against in the name of the United States of America,” Tompkins said. RELATED: Indianapolis protesters march for deaths of George Floyd, Dreasjon Reed Another protestor, Antoinette Willen, said she had seen a post on Facebook promoting the event that her friends had tagged her in, drove by the event and decided she too wanted to be part of the event. When she heard about the news regarding Floyd’s death and the protests that followed, Willen said she had “a lot of mixed feelings” because she is a person of color. “I just wanted to get the point across peacefully without riots and just a nice protest and just trying to get the community together and show everybody that we can all be one,” she said.   ""We brought our kids because it's important to teach them from an earlier age they know the difference between right and wrong and that we raise them as a future generation to carry this message,"" said Stephanie Marlow, a Muncie community member (pictured right). pic.twitter.com/NgTj0UEXpM — Bailey Cline (@BaileyCline) May 30, 2020   Marcy Kindred, who was also in attendance at the protest, said the protest was against police brutality and making the statement that black lives matter. Kindred said she felt “rage” when she heard about Floyd’s death, and was “heartbroken.” “Being a white person, I don’t feel the same trauma that people of color, especially black people of color face everyday when they see incidents like this,” she said. “It’s all together really traumatic, but I can never understand. So that’s why I stand.” Kindred said she is planning to attend the protest in Indianapolis later. She said she isn't worried about attending the Indianapolis protest because she plans to bring milk, baking soda and water in case police officers use tear gas on the protesters, as well as a change of clothes.

1621444500,2020-05-30 16:00:00,SpaceX rocket ship blasts off into orbit with 2 Americans,https://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2020/05/news-ap-spacex-rocket-ship-blasts-off-into-orbit-with-2-americans,en,True,,660448,Ball State Daily News,http://www.bsudailynews.com/,"By MARCIA DUNN CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era of commercial space travel and putting NASA back in the business of launching astronauts from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a sleek, white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send the Apollo astronauts to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they safely entered orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoonjust in time. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Joyce Beatty, an African-American congresswoman from Ohio, was briefly sprayed with ""Mace or pepper spray"" in downtown Columbus on Saturday while talking to people protesting the death of George Floyd. ""I was there because I wanted the young protesters to know that in solidarity, that I stand with them,"" Beatty told the local NBC 4 affiliate. ""You know, I'm a grandmother, I'm an elected official, but I'm a black woman first and I felt the pain,"" she said. Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin said in a post on Twitter that he and the congresswoman were ""sprayed with mace or pepper spray"" and ""we are all ok."" ""We came out there to support them and be with them,"" Beatty said in a video on Hardin's Twitter page. ""It was just something in my heart thinking about George Floyd, thinking about all of the injustices, that I needed to be out there, thinking I was protecting them and it probably was not safe,"" Beatty said. Dominic Manecke, a spokesman for Beatty, told CNN the incident happened when Beatty was attempting to mediate tensions between protesters against Floyd's killing and Columbus Police Department officials. ""People are angry. Tensions are very high and she went down there as a voice of reason. She has a very good connection with the community and was trying to be a mediator ... I mean the cops knew who she was and thanked her."" Manecke explained to CNN that Beatty, whose 3rd District encompasses a large swath of Columbus, was trying to separate an officer and a protester when she got caught in the ""melee"" of both groups that resulted in her getting sprayed. ""One young black female took a step off (the curb) and the cop kind of took that, I guess, 'sideways.' Instantly, a white man kind of came to her defense and then was instantly body-slammed to the ground. The congresswoman runs out into the street to hold back the cop and the protesters. Another cop comes up with his bike and pushes the congresswoman out of the way ... and then it's naturally getting heated ... that one cop pulls, I don't know why he does it, he pulls out his Mace and does what he does,"" Manecke said. CNN was unable to reach the Columbus Police Department for comment. In the Twitter video, Beatty criticized the police reaction to the escalating tensions from protestors, saying ""too much force is not the answer to this."" Beatty went on to to say that she is ""so proud of all of the young folks"" before calling for the protestors to remain calm. ""..We must continue to protest, but it must be peaceful and that does not mean we aren't standing up for justice,"" Beatty said. Saturday marked the fourth day of escalating protests in multiple cities over the death of Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

According to Attorney Benjamin Crump, the preliminary results released by the medical examiner show Floyd's cause of death to be the ""combined effects of Mr. Floyd's being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system."" In the statement, Crump writes that ""because the results do not address in detail the effect of purposeful use of force on Mr. Floyd's neck and the extent of Mr. Floyd's suffering at the hands of police, the family has chosen to engage an independent medical examiner to conduct their own autopsy."" The statement lists Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, and Dr. Alleca Wilson, and that the autopsy will be conducted in the Minneapolis area in the next few days. Findings of that report will be made public, according to Crump. AUTOPSY STATEMENT: The legal team representing the family of George Floyd has issued the following statement related to the preliminary autopsy findings by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. #GeorgeFloyd #SayHisName #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #JusticeForGeorge #JusticeForFloyd pic.twitter.com/2szasXwiz8 — Benjamin Crump, Esq. (@AttorneyCrump) May 30, 2020 The autopsy report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner is pending but preliminary findings show that Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" the report says, with no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Prosecutors ended the criminal complaint filed Friday against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, by saying, ""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.""",0.0

Stormy weather had threatened another postponement most of the day, but the outlook improved markedly in the afternoon, just ahead of the scheduled 3:22 p.m. liftoff of the 270-foot Falcon 9 in what would be the first launch of astronauts into orbit by a private company. Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. It would also be NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said. Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken pulled on their angular, white-and-black spacesuits with help from technicians wearing masks, gloves and black hoods that made them look like ninjas. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. SpaceX and NASA monitored the weather not just at Kennedy Space Center, where rain, thick clouds and the chance of lightning threatened another postponement, but all the way up the Eastern Seaboard and across the North Atlantic to Ireland. Waves and wind need to be within certain limits in case the astronauts have to make an emergency splashdown on the way to orbit. Wednesday’s countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. Ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. “I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn’t nervous,” Bridenstine said before the launch attempt. “We want to do everything we can to minimize the risk, minimize the uncertainty, so that Bob and Doug will be safe.” President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence planned to return for the second launch attempt. Because of the coronavirus, NASA severely limited the number of employees, visitors and journalists allowed deep inside Kennedy Space Center, and the crowd was relatively small, at a few thousand. At the center's tourist complex, though, all 4,000 tickets were snapped up in a few hours. The space agency urged people to stay safe and watch from home, and by NASA's count, at least 1.14 million viewers followed the launch preparation online. But spectators also began lining the Cape Canaveral area’s beaches and roads. Signs along the main beach drag read, “Godspeed.” Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year.",0.0
1621447465,2020-05-30 19:53:17,21-year-old shot and killed during Detroit protest over death of George Floyd,https://www.wthr.com/article/21-year-old-shot-and-killed-during-detroit-protest-over-death-george-floyd,en,True,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"DETROIT (AP) – One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit's Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn't involved in the shooting. A police report released Saturday said the shooting victim, a 21-year-old man, was sitting in the driver's seat of a silver Dodge Caliber in a parking lot with two other male occupants when an unknown person fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. Police earlier said that based on preliminary information, the shooting suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into a crowd. Kirkwood said the victim was pronounced dead at a hospital and that police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Of the 60 people who were arrested in Detroit's overnight protest, 37 don't live in the city, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80 percent black, many of those arrested were white. Craig listed Warren, Farmington Hills, West Bloomfield and Grand Blanc, which is about 60 miles northwest Detroit, as some of the hometowns of the people who were arrested. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” A number of Detroit activists intervened against the protesters to keep things from getting worse, Mayor Mike Duggan said at the news conference. The demonstration began earlier in the day Friday and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. As evening wore on, some in the crowd became belligerent and a police commander was struck in the head with a rock Friday evening and hospitalized. Another officer suffered a shoulder injury after falling. Officers, many in riot gear, confronted the demonstrators and formed lines across streets during the demonstration, but by midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The violence in Detroit and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd on for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down by his neck for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Saturday in a statement that “an overwhelming number of people were engaged in peaceful protest"" during Friday's protests over Floyd's death — a death which she said “has profoundly affected our nation."" Worthy said that while peaceful protests over Floyd's death are “absolutely warranted,"" acts of violence are not. And she urged protesters to engage in “safe, peaceful and civil protest of his murder."" “The point of protesting what happened to Mr. Floyd can be lost when violence becomes the narrative of the protest,"" she said.",0.0

At times, fireworks could be seen exploding over the demonstrations in the police department parking lot. More officers with riot gear arrived to assist. At one point, police officers and protesters were pushing each other in long lines. Shortly after 11 p.m., the protest seemed to have dispersed. Just a couple hours earlier Saturday, Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard due to civil unrest from protests.

Mayors of major cities imposed curfews, governors in nearly a dozen states deployed the National Guard in a desperate bid to stem the mayhem, chaos and wreckage. Though the incident that touched off the rioting occurred Monday in Minnesota and led to a cop being swiftly charged with murder, the damage seemed to culminate Saturday night and spanned from coast to coast. In Brooklyn, N.Y., at least 200 people were arrested and “countless” officers were hurt. In Beverly Hills, Calif., shops along the storied Rodeo Drive were looted as a crowd estimated at more than 2,000 people chanted “Eat the rich!’ BIDEN CAMPAIGN STAFFERS DONATE TO GROUP THAT BAILS OUT JAILED PROTESTERS: REPORT The protests were sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis cop, Derek Chauvin, was seen kneeling on his neck in a viral video. Chauvin has been fired and charged with third-degree murder, and the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the case. Crowds across the nation have seized on the racially charged incident to demand justice, but the protests have turned increasingly violent, culminating in a weekend of carnage. In New York, a woman was charged Saturday with attempted murder after allegedly throwing a Molotov cocktail into a police squad car in Brooklyn. Cars were set ablaze in the borough, and in Manhattan’s usually peaceful Union Square, where cops squared off against protesters late into the night. Protesters turned violent after a video circulated online showing an NYPD SUV ramming into a group of protesters in Brooklyn. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident “troubling,” but added, “if those protesters had just gotten out of the way and not created an attempt to surround that vehicle, we would not be talking about this situation.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Los Angeles County as hundreds of looters converged on downtown stores and clashed with cops. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a curfew for Saturday night after 500 people were arrested and five police officers were hurt as protests turned violent. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot imposed a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. after hundreds of protesters gathered at Federal Plaza for a demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter. Police cars were set ablaze and covered with anti-cop graffiti and demonstrators were reportedly arrested near Trump Tower. Some 13 Philadelphia police officers were injured and more than a dozen people arrested as cars were burned and businesses vandalized before midnight. Mayor Jim Kenney implemented a mandatory citywide curfew starting at 8 p.m. and lasting until 6 a.m.Sunday. In Indianapolis, three people were shot and killed and at least two others wounded as protests morphed into mob violence, according to Police Chief Randal Taylor. In Denver, a car rammed into a police vehicle, “severely” injuring three officers and a civilian and rioters armed with crowbars, baseball bats, assault rifles and handguns attacked cops and peaceful protesters, according to Police Chief Paul Pazen. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee activated 200 National Guard members after rioting in Seattle intensified. After protesters shut down Interstate 5 through central Seattle, police used flash bangs and pepper spray to scatter them. Violent protests, vandalism and riots were reported in dozens of other cities. Damage to police vehicles and assaults against law enforcement officers Saturday night prompted San Francisco Mayor London Breed to call for an immediate curfew until 5 a.m. local time — and to request that California National Guard personnel be placed on standby. “What we are seeing tonight — the violence, the vandalism and the crimes being committed in our city, not against property but against other people — that is something that we will not tolerate,” Breed said, according to FOX 2 of the Bay Area. “What we are seeing tonight — the violence, the vandalism and the crimes being committed in our city, not against property but against other people — that is something that we will not tolerate.” — London Breed, San Francisco mayor Across the bay in Emeryville, a popular shopping destination, looters appeared to be running rampant, smashing windows, and stealing items from popular stores including Best Buy, BevMo and Urban Outfitters, according to the report. In addition, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Los Angeles County, FOX 11 reported. NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH Many cities stepped up police presence, with TV and social media showing images of rioters being hit with pepper spray or rubber bullets. In Ohio, 70-year-old U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty was among a group of people hit with pepper spray as police looked to gain control in Columbus, the state capital. “I’m ok. Was just trying my best to deescalate the situation,” Beatty wrote on Twitter afterward. OHIO DEM REP, OTHER OFFICIALS PEPPER-SPRAYED DURING PROTEST IN COLUMBUS Earlier Saturday, President Trump condemned the riots that had taken place in previous days, vowing to stop what he labeled “mob violence.” “The memory of Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters, and anarchists,” Trump said, blaming “Antifa and other radical left-wing groups for terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.” Later Saturday, presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called the protests “utterly American,” while also calling for an end to “needless destruction.” National Guard arrives In Utah, the National Guard arrived in Salt Lake City after protests turned violent. Police vehicles were targeted and set on fire Saturday, prompting Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, to call for an 8 p.m. curfew that will last until 6 a.m. Monday. Police forces appeared overly rough with an elderly man watching the protests, and knocked him to the ground. Only minor injuries were reported for police and protesters. In Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms established a curfew starting at 9 p.m. Saturday following Friday night’s violent protests. The protests continued Saturday and police arrested demonstrators who were blocking traffic. Security officials surrounded Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s house as crowds of protesters gathered near the mansion. A brick was reportedly thrown at one of the police officers. Mayor Bottoms denounced the riots at a Saturday news conference. “When you run it down the street with a Gucci bag, that’s not about black people dying in America,” she said. “That’s about killing ourselves when we do things like that.” “When you run it down the street with a Gucci bag, that’s not about black people dying in America. That’s about killing ourselves when we do things like that.” — Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta mayor Multiple police vehicles were reportedly set on fire after protesters and police officers clashed. FOX NEWS CREW CHASED, ATTACKED BY ANGRY MOB WHILE REPORTING ON PROTESTS OUTSIDE WHITE HOUSE The protest started peacefully in front of City Hall as hundreds of people kneeled in silence in honor of George Floyd. “We appreciate their voice and their manner of expression. However, since that time, others have convened in Center City and are committing criminal acts, including vandalism. Those acts will not be tolerated,” the Philadelphia Police Department tweeted. About 3,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Chicago on Saturday, filling the streets and climbing on cars and buses. Police and protesters clashed in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower after police with helmets and batons pushed demonstrators out of the way so a police car could get through. Bottles and fireworks were reportedly thrown at police officers in front of the hotel. Video posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be Chicago police officers being swarmed, hit and dragged by protesters. In Chicago, 108 people were reportedly arrested, but no serious injuries were reported. But police responded to more than a dozen “police emergencies” as they tried to control the crowds. In Washington, protesters again converged outside the White House, with some climbing on top of Secret Service cars and pushing security barricades further down Pennsylvania Avenue. POLICE CHIEFS ACROSS US CONDEMN OFFICERS INVOLVED IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH President Trump had praised the Secret Service’s action Friday night by saying the protesters would “…have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons,” had they crossed the White House fence. But Trump criticized D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for not letting D.C. police get involved, quoting her as saying “not their job.” Bowser fired back, first calling Trump’s comments “gross” and saying his reference to attack dogs ignited the worst memories in America’s fight against segregation. “We are grieving hundreds of years of institutional racism,” Bowser said. “People are tired, sad, angry, and desperate for change.” PROTESTS DEMANDING JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD RAMP UP AGAIN NATIONWIDE Bowser, who was joined by D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham, also said that Trump’s claims regarding the D.C. police were false. D.C. police were present, along with U.S. Park Police, Friday night, and were ready to help Secret Service in Layfette Park, the area where protestors gathered in front of the White House, as they have done in the past. Close to 300 protesters were reportedly arrested in New York City between Thursday and Friday night, and demonstrators continued to protest through Saturday. New Yorkers also mourned the death of Eric Garner, who died from an NYPD officer’s chokehold in 2014 by attending a rally the Rev. Al Sharpton hosted. The crowd chanted “I can’t breathe,” which were the last words Garner reportedly said — but also one of the last statements said by Floyd before he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has responded to the nationwide protests by blaming liberal leaders and threatening use of the military involvement. In a tweet Saturday, he said: “Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military.”",0.0

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said one of the shootings happened around 2:30 a.m. near the intersection of Talbot and Market streets, in the heart of the downtown area. “Enough is enough,” IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor told reporters shortly before midnight. “Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time. Residents who do not live in the downtown area, we’re asking to please vacate the area.” NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH Between 11:45 p.m. and 3 a.m., five people were reportedly shot, three of whom died as the protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis. Earlier in the evening, the IMPD put out an advisory, telling residents to avoid the downtown area. “We are investigating multiple shootings downtown,” police tweeted. “These are NOT officer-involved incidents.” Police said officers fired no shots during the overnight hours. The protests over the police violence against black Americans in Indianapolis started calm Saturday afternoon, as demonstrators gathered in the afternoon in the city’s Monument Circle. But after sunset, tension began to rise and the protests turned violent, with people breaking windows and setting fires, FOX59 reported. Taylor told reporters that such behavior wouldn’t be tolerated, urging everyone to go home. “If you’re still down here tonight you are more than likely into something that you shouldn’t be and we want you to go home,” he said. MORE RIOTS, LOOTING PROMPT CURFEWS, CALLS FOR NATIONAL GUARD IN CITIES, STATES ACROSS US Buildings in the city’s downtown were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. At least one IMPD officer had minor injuries from an unspecified incident. Deputy Chief Josh Barker said some arrests were reported but did not have a definite number, according to the IndyStar. “There were several people down here who had no intention to protest. Their intention was to riot,” Barker said. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said that earlier in the day, the city hosted a “successful protest” that allowed hundreds to “lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.” “Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence,” the mayor said. “It is unacceptable, and it must stop.” Much like Friday, Saturday’s demonstration began peacefully but turned violent as the sun began to set. Taylor said that on Friday, at least 30 businesses were damaged and 27 people were arrested during demonstrations that continued through at least 4 a.m. The violence in Indianapolis and many other cities were sparked by anger over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill. Third-degree murder and manslaughter charges were filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down, as Floyd pleaded for air.

What started as mostly peaceful protests earlier in the week have turned into chaos. City leaders have pleaded with communities to voice their outrage in a lawful manner, but the widespread escalation of protests continued Friday night into Saturday. In the wake of Floyd’s death, murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, one of four officers at the scene, all of whom have been fired. The Department of Justice said a full investigation of the incident is a “top priority.” Prosecutors said Chauvin, seen in the video pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck, had his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including for two minutes and 53 seconds when Floyd was unresponsive. This story will be updated throughout the day. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern. 7:38 a.m.: Richmond police investigating shooting incident during protests The Richmond Police Department is investigating a shooting that happened during the violent protests overnight. At approximately 1:04 a.m. this morning, officers were notified that an adult male victim had arrived at a local hospital. He was taken there in a private vehicle. The victim suffered a life-threatening gunshot wound when the vehicle he was riding in came in contact with a group of protesters at approximately 12:30 a.m. in the 2000 block of W. Grace Street. Detectives have determined the gunshots came from behind the vehicle. There is no suspect description at this time and the investigation is ongoing.  6:35 a.m.: 345 people arrested in New York City on Saturday amid protests, 33 officers injured 345 people were arrested in New York City on Saturday night and into early Sunday morning after a second round of protests over the death of George Floyd turned violent. There were also 33 police officers injured and 47 police vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Daytime marches that blocked traffic but were mainly peaceful devolved at night into projectile throwing and the torching of police vehicles. Multiple police vehicles were set on fire or defaced with graffiti. The 33 officers were injured in demonstrations throughout parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. None of the injuries are life threatening but some are serious. Police faced criticism after video circulated on social media that appeared to show a police SUV pushing a metal barrier into a crowd of demonstrators. Mayor de Blasio, who briefs at 10a, said in a late night news conference the police were put in an impossible situation “I wish the officers found a different approach,” the mayor said. “The protesters on that video did the wrong thing to surround that police car.”  6:05 a.m. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 U.S. cities in the past 3 days George Floyd was accused by a convenience store clerk on May 25 of attempting to use a counterfeit $20 bill when Minneapolis Police Department officers arrived on scene. About 20 minutes later, Floyd was pronounced dead, and four days later, former officer Derek Chauvin, who is now in police custody, was charged with third-degree murder. 5:57 a.m.: At least one killed in Indianapolis in shooting amid protests  Police Chief Randal Taylor of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department held a press conference late last night confirming that at least one person has been shot and killed and at three more people had been shot throughout the day as protests engulfed the city. Said Taylor: “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests. Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings. Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD. We’re asking that residents who do not live in the downtown area go home. Enough is enough. Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time. Residents who do not live in the downtown area, we’re asking to please vacate the area.” The IMPD did not give any further details on the circumstances around the death of the individual involved in the shooting and said that they had “lost count” of the number of reported shots being fired across the city. 4:32 a.m.: 28 arrested in Nashville; horses used to back crowd away from precinct A total of 28 people have been arrested by the Metro Nashville Police Department after the 10 p.m. curfew took effect. Earlier in the day, protesters marched down Broadway and 1st Avenue North arriving at 1 Public Square to continue protesting outside of the Metropolitan Nashville Courthouse. Protesters could be seen shouting “no peace” and “don’t shoot’ as they gathered on the steps of Public Square Park. Protesters reportedly broke out windows of Metro courthouse and spray-painted obscenities against law enforcement on the walls and sidewalk. A group of people also managed to break into the Metro courthouse and set fire to the outside and inside of the building before authorities were able to disperse the crowd using fireworks and a smoke bomb. Protesters could also be seen outside the front of the courthouse burning an American flag.  3:39 a.m.: Target temporarily closes 175 stores in 13 states due to protests Target released a new statement late Saturday night announcing that they will be temporarily closing 175 stores due to ongoing protests.

Team members impacted by store closures will be paid for up to 14 days of scheduled hours during store closures, including COVID-19 premium pay.  2:43 a.m.: No civilian or officer injuries as ‘dozens’ arrested in Minneapolis  Minnesota’s commissioner of corrections says they’re still working to finalize the total arrest numbers from overnight but that, to his knowledge, dozens had been arrested by 10 p.m. local time. Commissioner Paul Schnell said “rapid response teams” were working to break-up small groups still roaming the streets of Minneapolis overnight. They reported no injuries among people in the streets as well as to responding officers. Authorities shutdown major freeways in the city and closed off key routes between Minneapolis and St. Paul to prevent groups from moving between the two cities. A police line blocked the Ford Parkway Bridge. It was a very different night compared to what happened on Friday in Minneapolis. Local authorities said Saturday’s law enforcement response would be noticeably different and it seems that the new tactics along with more manpower was working. Authorities launched an aggressive operation to disperse the crowd of hundreds that gathered around the Precinct 5 police department. Thursday, protesters burned the Precinct 3 department to the ground. About 40 minutes after Saturday’s 8 p.m. curfew began, riot police seemed to appear from every direction, dozens coming off of city buses and deploying flashbangs and tear gas. “I believe tonight went far better than expected,” Schnell said. He called Saturday night’s effort to clear the crowd of demonstrators a “decisive and strong action.” The response certainly appeared more aggressive than nights before and seems to have been successful in helping authorities reclaiming the streets of the Twin Cities. There were no major fires like the ones that burned in the days prior. The question now is what will Sunday bring to this city. Police believe they’ve “drawn a line” and made progress. Said the commissioner: “We’re in this until this is addressed. We don’t feel that we’re out of this yet. We’re seeing this types of issues occurring across the nation.”  2:02 a.m.: Atlanta police arrest 70 people, majority of protesters have now dispersed  Atlanta Police have issued a statement saying that they are no longer working any major incidents and the vast majority of protesters have dispersed. A total of 70 people have been arrested Saturday night into Sunday morning. “As of 1:30 a.m., APD officers were not working any major incidents and it appeared that the vast majority of protesters had dispersed. Officers arrested 70 individuals Saturday night, into Sunday morning,” the APD said in the statement.  1:42 a.m.: Denver authorities arrest 18 as protests ease from previous two nights Denver officials say a curfew helped keep Saturday night’s protests around the state capitol much more peaceful than the previous two nights when businesses, city and state buildings took significant damage. “We’re serious about this. This was not a game to be played. Lives were at stake. Very serious property damage was at stake. We weren’t going to stand for it again in this city,” Denver Mayor Michael Hancock told ABC News’ Denver affiliate KMGH-TV. “We meant this curfew. We will continue to enforce it accordingly.” The Denver Police Chief told KMGH-TV that the department arrested 18 people Saturday night, including one man allegedly carrying this handgun illegally. Throughout the day and evening, several skirmishes broke out between police and protesters, who built makeshift roadblocks and set them on fire as police in riot gear advanced, firing teargas to clear the streets. One woman was reportedly shot at point blank range in the back by an officer firing a pepper ball round and several cars were also burned. Things are mostly quiet now, with a few remaining protesters and police on the streets. Denver’s curfew is in effect until 5 a.m. local time and again on Sunday night. 1:34 a.m.: Houston mayor says George Floyd’s body will return to Houston Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has said the body of Houston native George Floyd will return to the city. Turner spoke to the community late Saturday afternoon and encourage residents to protest peacefully, after looting was reported on the first night. “This is our house. This is the same city that George Floyd grew up,” Turner said. “And his body will be returning to this city. To his city.” Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center in Rosharon, Texas, posted a flyer on Facebook with a picture of Floyd, stating funeral arrangements are forthcoming. Floyd’s family and attorneys have yet to confirm funeral arrangements for the 46-year-old. “The focus needs to be on supporting and uplifting his family. And that’s what I want to keep bringing this conversation to. George Floyd. It’s not about these other individuals, who won’t be a moment. It’s about George Floyd, and justice for George Floyd,” said Turner.  1:12 a.m.: Protests mount in Ferguson, Missouri Ferguson, Missouri, tonight has taken a violent turn as protesters have vandalized the police department. Notably, Ferguson was the center of civil of unrest in 2014 after the fatal police shooting of Mike Brown by police officer Darrel Wilson. Per the St. Louis County Police Department, all non-essential personnel have been evacuated at the Ferguson Police Department. Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency late Saturday and activated the Missouri National Guard to stand ready to assist. A total of two officers were injured and transported to the hospital while two others were treated on the scene for minor injuries. Crowds have now dispersed and officers will continue patrol for the night.  12:53 a.m.: Miami-Dade Police arrest 38 people, suspends all transit services on Sunday The Miami-Dade Police Department have announced that 38 people have been arrested so far after Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez signed a local state of emergency declaration, ordering a curfew that took place at 10 p.m. last night until 6 a.m. on Sunday after some protesters began to burn police cars at the Miami Police Station. The Department of Transportation and Public Works also has suspended all Miami-Dade Transit services on Sunday, May 31, including Metrorail, Metromover and Metrobus. This decision was made in an abundance of caution, and to ensure the safety of all passengers and employees, according to a statement released by Miami-Dade County. 12:46 a.m.: Biden releases statement on protests, urges understanding but cautions against ‘needless destruction’ Former vice president Joe Biden released a paper statement just after midnight eastern on the ongoing unrest and protests currently gripping several major American cities, urging an understanding of the trauma many people of color in America are facing in the wake of George Floyd’s death, but also speaking out against the “needless destruction,” that is playing out as a result of the protests. “These last few days have laid bare that we are a nation furious at injustice. Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd,” Biden wrote. “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not,” he added. The presumptive Democratic nominee also added that the protests going on tonight should not overshadow the cause they are trying to advance. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance,” Biden wrote. Biden also acknowledged the widespread pain across the country, not only from the pain of Floyd’s death, but from coronavirus as well, relating to the feeling of grief, but implored the country to use the current anger to “compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.” “I know that there are people all across this country who are suffering tonight. Suffering the loss of a loved one to intolerable circumstances, like the Floyd family, or to the virus that is still gripping our nation. Suffering economic hardships, whether due to COVID-19 or entrenched inequalities in our system. And I know that a grief that dark and deep may at times feel too heavy to bear,” Biden said. “I know.” “And I also know that the only way to bear it is to turn all that anguish to purpose. So tonight, I ask all of America to join me — not in denying our pain or covering it over– but using it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.” “We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us,” the statement said. Biden also pledged, if elected, to help lead a conversation on the issues that have caused the current unrest, and referenced again his recent conversation with George Floyd’s family and a promise he made to ensure his death will not just be a “hashtag.” “As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. We must and will get to a place where everyone, regardless of race, believes that ‘to protect and serve’ means to protect and serve them,” Biden wrote. “Please stay safe. Please take care of each other,” he added, ending his statement. 12:39 a.m.: Los Angeles issues mandatory curfew for the entire city The Los Angeles Police Department has issued a mandatory curfew from 8 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. for the entire city.

Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday in police custody in Minneapolis. Four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving, the Associated Press reported. Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, was arrested Friday and charged with murder, according to the AP. However, protesters in Indianapolis were marching for more than George Floyd — some were also marching for Dreasjon “Sean” Reed, a 21-year-old black man, who the police have said died May 6 in a gunfire exchange with an Indianapolis police officer, according to an AP article. The police officers involved in the incident did not have body camera or dash camera footage, it states. On May 12, city officials said Indianapolis police officers will be equipped with body cameras starting this summer. RELATED: Protest held in downtown Muncie following George Floyd’s death Saturday’s protest started at Monument Circle and marched through downtown Indianapolis until they met a larger crowd at the Indiana War Memorial. Kyra Harvey, an organizer from Indy Ten Black Lives Matter, said she attended the protest to ensure everyone is heard and the city hears their demands in the Reed case. ""On a local level, we’ve asked for [the officers responsible] to be fired [and] a change in the use-of-force policy,” Harvey said. Alongside those demands, she said her organization has also asked for the officer to be indicted and the mayor to meet with the family and release Reed’s autopsy report. Harvey said the Reed case “sparked another type of anger in people.” She said her organization received donations from the supporters who provided cases of water, gallons of milk and medical supplies in to help those who may be injured in the protest. GALLERY: George Floyd protests in Fort Wayne, Indiana Matty Slaydon, a member of Queer in Indy, a radical queer organization supporting Black Lives Matter , said they rallied many in the community who were not people of color to the steps of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument at Monument circle to say one thing — “listen to black people.” “My priority is to keep people of color safe,” Slaydon said. In all their years of organizing, Slaydon said the closest thing they have seen to the Saturday crowd in Indianapolis crowd were the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri. “People are tired of black people dying,” they said. A Second Amendment rights group, Indiana 2A United, was also present in support of George Floyd and First and Second Amendment rights on Saturday. “This isn’t a liberal or conservative issue, this is an American issue,” said Ryan Secord, a member of the group. “We all have the right to live freely without being killed by our government.” Families were also in attendance at the protests like that of Diamond Asabi, who came along with her husband and two children. “We want to see a difference so that our children can walk the streets, ride in their cars and jog down the road freely,” Asabi said. “We want to see a real change systematically.” Police presence picked up more than usual after 7 p.m. as sirens were sounded throughout the city. Tear gas was thrown into the crowd forcing people to run toward safety as they poured milk on their eyes to help with the burning sensation. After Friday evenings protests when some protestors were arrested, Harvey said The Bail Project, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to combat mass incarceration through disrupting bail money, has offered to pay the bail of any protesters arrested Saturday. Later that night, the Associated Press reports three people in Indianapolis were shot Saturday night, including one fatally, during what they described as peaceful daytime protests giving way to unrest and destruction later. No details about the shootings were immediately released, but the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said no officers were involved, the AP article states. Police Chief Randal Taylor said on Friday, at least 30 businesses were damaged and 27 people were arrested during demonstrations that continued through at least 4 a.m., the article states. Saturday night marked the second straight night when protests became dangerous in Indianapolis, it states, as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire.

1621568065,2020-05-31 09:43:31,Indianapolis riots: What we know about Saturday night's protests,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/625684820/0/indystar/allnews~Indianapolis-riots-What-we-know-about-Saturday-nights-protests/,en,False,,85390,blogs.indystar.com,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider,"For the second consecutive night, Indianapolis descended into chaos as peaceful Saturday afternoon protests gave way to violence by nightfall. Here's what we know about the riots that have rocked downtown Indianapolis this weekend. Things started peacefully Much like Friday, protests started peacefully when they began in the early afternoon Saturday in downtown Indianapolis. Thousands marched through the city chanting “I can’t breathe,” “black lives matter” and “ACAB 1312” – an anti-police reference – to voice their frustration. The demonstrations were the result of multiple local civil rights organizations calling people to action. Organizers also worked to ensure that those there to support their cause did so in an orderly manner. Instructions to not resort to violence or cause damage was included in social media invitations and during the events. When members of the crowd began to throw water bottles or other items, organizers urged them to stop and regained control. The restraint shown by demonstrators during the day was noted and commended by both Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Randal Taylor and Mayor Joe Hogsett. ""Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests. Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful,"" Taylor said during a late Saturday night press conference. Chaos erupts downtown When the sun went down and the organized protests ended, police and demonstrators who remained on the street clashed as tensions boiled over. Around 9 p.m., about two hours after city officials asked protest organizers to wrap up their events and clear the streets, a number of downtown businesses and vehicles again suffered damage. Protesters broke windows, started fires and sprayed graffiti on buildings. At least 30 businesses were damaged overnight Friday. How many were damaged overnight Saturday was unclear Sunday morning. Police in riot gear Saturday night deployed tear gas and crowd control projectiles while making arrests. They made attempts to secure the area with walls of squad cars and uniformed officers. Helicopters could be heard overhead. The voices of police officers telling the crowd that the demonstration had become an unlawful gathering blared from speakers and megaphones. Multiple shootings reported By midnight, IMPD had confirmed one fatal shooting that claimed a man's life at Talbot and Vermont streets, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. On Sunday morning, they confirmed one more death from a shooting that happened around 2:30 a.m. Sunday. One man who was shot at Market and Pennsylvania streets died at the hospital. It is unclear whether the shooting was connected to the overnight riots. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said Saturday night. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time. Residents who do not live in the downtown area, we’re asking to please vacate the area.” But the rioting continued. As Saturday night became Sunday morning, fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and businesses. What's planned Sunday Indiana faith leaders will hold a processional Sunday in light of the police-involved killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis. The 2 p.m. event will begin at the Indiana Statehouse at 200 W. Washington St. “It has been said evil persists when good men say and do nothing, and it is incumbent upon every decent human being to condemn the killing of unarmed black men and women in this country,” Kenneth Sullivan, senior pastor of New Direction Church, said in a news release. Why people are protesting Protests across the nation were sparked by the May 25 police-involved killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a black man, died after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His arrest was captured on video and widely shared on social media. Also powering the national protests are the deaths of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police in March, and Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot three times as he jogged by a white father and son who pursued him in a pickup truck. Protesters in Indianapolis Friday and Saturday said they are also protesting the police-involved shooting death of 21-year-old Reed on May 6. Reed was fatally shot by an IMPD officer following a pursuit on the city's north side. Part of the pursuit and the shooting were streamed live on Facebook. Police said Reed had been driving recklessly and they found a gun at the scene of his shooting that had been fired. Call IndyStar reporter Justin L. Mack at 317-444-6138.

A video circulating on social media fueled an already heated debate about the use of police force as an incident caught on camera showed an NYPD cruiser ramming into a crowd of protesters in New York City. De Blasio said he’s “not going to blame officers” for the incident, instead saying it was wrong for protesters to throw water bottles and other objects while surrounding the NYPD vehicles. “It’s inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers. That’s wrong on its face,” de Blasio said late on Saturday night during a press briefing. Police arrested 345 people during the protests. NYPD SERGEANT’S UNION SHOOTS BACK AT DE BLASIO AFTER MAYOR ASKS FOR ‘LIGHT TOUCH’ WITH PROTESTERS The mayor said the pockets of violence were only a small representation of the hundreds of people who turned out in the city to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custory after a white police officer in Minneapolis kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes while making an arrest. “Peaceful protesters, if you’re out tonight… we hear your issues, the need for justice, real change. If you went out, you have been heard,” de Blasio said just before midnight. He warned that anyone out to “create violence” won’t be tolerated. “You will get arrested tonight,” added. “A different element has come into play here,” de Blasio said of the protesters involved in the incident in New York. “Trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles — if a police officer is in that situation they have to get out of that situation.” The NYPD told Fox News that 33 officers were injured and 47 police vehicles were damaged in demonstrations held across Brooklyn and other neighborhoods throughout New York City. “The video was upsetting and I wish the officers hadn’t done that, but I also understood that they didn’t start the situation. The situation was started by a group of protesters converging on a police vehicle, attacking that vehicle. It’s unacceptable,” the mayor said. Meanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., demanded de Blasio investigate the situation, saying, “these officers need to be brought to justice, not dismissed w/’internal reviews.'” “NYPD officers just drove an SUV into a crowd of human beings. They could‘ve killed them, &we don’t know how many they injured. NO ONE gets to slam an SUV through a crowd of human beings,” she said on Twitter. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea applauded officers for handling what he called an “unprecedented” situation. “I’m extremely proud of the way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger,” Shea said in a statement released on Sunday. Tensions between law enforcement and their communities have continued to boil over as protesters across the country came out to demonstrate against police brutality and racial injustice.

The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have elevated fears of a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Images showing thousands of screaming, unmasked protesters have sent shudders through the health community, who worry their calls for social distancing during the demonstrations are unlikely to be heard. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.”",0.0

Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” Demonstrators block the path of a Los Angeles Fire Department truck during a public disturbance on Melrose Avenue, Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. By midnight, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department had confirmed one fatality, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. Commentary: Indianapolis in troubled times: 'Why are you crying? More: Business leaders call for an end to looting IMPD deemed Downtown unsafe and asked residents to stay away from the area, even as fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and, in some cases, banks and other businesses. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice — No Peace."" The Saturday demonstrations followed a tense night Friday in Indianapolis, where crowds of people marched Downtown to protest police shootings, including the killings of Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and, most recently, George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said the protests that started Friday and continued until about 4 a.m. Saturday resulted in 27 arrests and damage to at least 30 business, including a CVS that was looted and sustained fire damage. It's unclear how many arrests were made and businesses damaged Saturday night and into the Sunday morning hours. A peaceful demonstration turns into something else The slow-rolling protest Saturday elicited a mix of cheers and jeers from motorists, bystanders and people watching the action unfold live on social media. Police took a hands off approach until just after sunset, when a confrontation occurred at Market and Alabama streets, where protesters blocked the road in front of a line of squad cars. “This is no longer a lawful assembly. You are subject to arrest,"" an officer told protesters several times over a public address system. Most of the protesters held their position blocking the road. An IndyStar reporter at the scene saw 10 officers and four police cars. Most were wearing gas masks and standing still. One protester threw a water bottle at an officer, and several others followed. Officers then began firing tear gas. Many of the protesters scattered from the area and retreated further back in the streets. At a late night media briefing IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor condemned the violence and said officers had been working very well with the protest organizers earlier in the day. “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests,"" Taylor said in a prepared statement. ""Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings."" He continued: ""Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD."" Officials urged peaceful assembly In the wake of the conflict and violence less than 24 hours earlier, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett issued statements urging those returning Downtown for the two Saturday protests to refrain from violence and vandalism. Hogsett said he also asked organizers to conclude the events by 7 p.m. and encourage participants to leave the Downtown area after that time. It all went according to plan, at least initially. Police said there were no arrests or major issues when the second protest formally ended at 7 p.m. But few in the crowd — a mix of mostly young blacks and whites, many wearing masks — appeared to heed warnings to leave from organizers. Instead the crowd continued to snake through city street north and east of monument circle for nearly two hours before the standoff near the northeast corner of the City-County Building. The feelings of racial injustice fueling the protests extend far beyond Indianapolis and Indiana, said Deziree Walker, a native of Griffith, Indiana, and former IUPUI student who marched with the protesters Saturday. ""Seeing what's been going on for years and years and years, we're tired. We're exhausted,"" she explained. ""We want change. That's why we're here today."" Indy joins cities around the nation The local protests are part of a nationwide eruption of unrest that has drawn throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities, including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Some cities have seen five days of protests. In Indianapolis, Taylor said five IMPD vehicles were damaged and three officers and three civilians were injured Friday night and early Saturday morning, including a person who sustained what Taylor characterized as ""severe lacerations"" while kicking glass. As some protesters grew unruly, police in riot gear launched tear gas canisters and shot pepper balls in an effort to break up the crowd. Just after midnight, police said, someone fired shots at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy outside 1 American Square. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire. No suspect has been arrested. Demonstrators returned Downtown Saturday afternoon for the first of two planned protests. As they gathered at the Indiana Convention Center, city workers and private crews hustled to block off several streets and place sheets of plywood over ground-floor windows. Both events Saturday were publicized on social media by local organizers who urged participants to refrain from violence. At 5;30 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 gathered at the Indiana War Memorial began moving to Monument Circle chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice — No peace"" and ""Hands up — Don't shot."" At the circle, a protester spray-painted BLM, for black lives matter, on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Earlier, about 100 demonstrators began gathering around 1 p.m. at the convention center for an event promoted as a show of solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. It was organized by Indianapolis resident Malik Muhammad. About 50 people from that event moved north to the war memorial for the second protest at 4 p.m. They marched north amid chants of ""What do we want — body cams"" and ""when do we want them — now."" The second protest, which focused on the shooting of Reed, was organized by Indianapolis resident Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student. She called for the release of an autopsy report and the names of officers involved in the May 6 shooting. ""There has been no justice for his case,"" Brown said through a bullhorn. ""And there will never be justice for his case."" The crowd quickly swelled from a few hundred to an estimated 2,000 or more. Brown said the event, which had been set to end at sunset, or 9:05 p.m., would instead end at 7 p.m. Anything that happens after that, Brown said, is not affiliated with her event. She urged the crowd to remain nonviolent, and warned that IMPD had told her that it could use force to clear the streets after 7 p.m. Brown's message echoed statements earlier Saturday from Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Both issued public statements acknowledging the right to demonstrate, but urging participants to remain peaceful and refrain from vandalism or looting. Hogsett said he met Saturday morning to discuss the protests with representatives of Indy10 Black Lives Matter and the mother of Reed, 21, who was shot and killed by IMPD officers earlier this month after a police chase he recorded on Facebook Live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say he fired a weapon. As he ran, the officer first attempted to tase him, then shot. The shooting is under investigated. The mayor said he made commitments to ""continued change"" in the areas of community policing, transparency and police accountability, including implementing body cameras and a new use-of-force review board. ""We must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless,"" he said. Hogsett added he hoped demonstrations would conclude by 7 p.m. The mayor said he asked the organizers to instruct demonstrators to return to their homes at that time. ""I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,"" he said. ""But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love."" The Mayor took to Twitter at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to condemn the violence. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" Hogsett's social media post said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" The Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement calling for an end to the violence. ""The opportunity to succeed is central to the growth of Indianapolis, and significant barriers including systemic racism threaten this opportunity,"" said CEO Michael Huber. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change. When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury.""

The deadly shootings happened at Market and Talbot streets and 10 E. Market St. Two people were also shot in the area of Alabama and New York streets, according to IMPD. Their condition was unknown. The shootings puncuated a chaotic series of events as IMPD officers and protestors clashed for the second consecutive night. The protests mirrored those in other cities across the country set off by anger over the death of a black man in police custody. In downtown Indianapolis, windows were smashed, stores looted, tear gas filled the air and fires burned in streets. Police said they received so many report of shots fired that they lost count. Around 1:20 a.m. Sunday, Mayor Joe Hogsett sent out a series of Tweets in which he called for an end to unrest and violence in the city. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" he said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" Hogsett said his offce and the police department remain committed to discussing reforms that address ""centuries of inequity"" and ensuring the safety of peaceful protesters. ""And I would ask all who speak out in the days that follow to reject the tactics of those who would diminish a movement toward national action into unproductive destruction,"" he said.

Hundreds gathered across the downtown area, including Monument Circle and the Indiana War Memorial – where they filled the plaza facing Vermont Street. Paul Napier brought his young son with him as he marched through the streets. ""I want him to grow up understanding these issues and hopefully by the time he's my age he won't be seeing this,"" says Napier. The protest, like others around the country, follows the deaths of George Floyd, while he was in Minneapolis police custody, and Dreasjon Reed, who was shot by an Indianapolis police officer earlier this month. Chants of ""Who killed Dreasjon Reed?” were heard as the crowd moved through Indianapolis streets to the War Memorial. Indianapolis City-County Councilor Ali Brown handed out masks on Monument Circle. ""There is a lot of rage, and I can't understand what it's like to be black or the black experience,"" says Brown. ""I'm here to support my friends and my community."" IMPD Deputy Chief Josh Barker says it's important to delineate between the violence and the peaceful protests at Monument Circle and the Indiana War Memorial. ""In the very beginning today we saw what we consider one of the most successful protests that Indianapolis has experienced,"" Barker says. ""You had between 300 and 600 people that came down to peacefully gather."" Barker says IMPD worked with the organizers of those protests to set expectations and provided traffic control so the groups could move throughout the city.

During a press conference Saturday afternoon, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said he met earlier in the day with Reed's mother and representatives of Indy Black Lives Matter. He said they requested that protestors who planned to gather Saturday night remain peaceful and disperse early in the evening.

(CNN) -- Police are investigating after a video appeared to show a New York City Police Department truck plowing through a crowd during Saturday's protests over the death of George Floyd. The 27-second video, which was posted to Twitter, shows an NYPD truck in front of a crowd throwing objects at the vehicle. There is a barricade in front of the truck. The truck then appears to drive into the barricade, knocking over protestors.Screaming and yelling are heard while a person is seen jumping on top of the truck. It's unclear if there were any injuries. The incident further fuels the flames of negative interactions between police and the people they're sworn to protect. A lot of the protests erupting in major cities across the US are the result of people's anger boiling over after the death of Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the incident is under investigation, but emphasized that the officers may have had no other choice. ""I'm not going to blame officers who were trying to deal with an absolutely impossible situation. The folks who were converging on that police car did the wrong thing to begin with, and they created an untenable situation,"" he said. ""I wish the officers had found a different approach, but let's begin at the beginning. The protesters in that video did the wrong thing to surround that police car, period."" But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York slammed de Blasio's comments as ""unacceptable."" ""As mayor, this police department is under your leadership,"" she tweeted Sunday morning. ""Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong. Make it right. De-escalate."" The mayor emphasized late Saturday that he had spoken with community leaders and there is a possibility that there areprotesters who are intentionally trying to incite violence including those who have come to New York City from other places. ""People who represent the communities of our city and the residents of our city are not joining negative and violent protests,"" de Blasio said. CNN has reached out to the NYPD, and the offices of the New York governor and attorney general for comment. Earlier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had ordered the attorney general to independently review the events of Friday's protests that included protesters clashing with police in Brooklyn and other boroughs.

Credit: CNN (CNN) -- From Minneapolis to Washington DC, from Louisville to Las Vegas, reporters are facing assault and arrest while reporting on widespread protests and unrest. At least a half dozen different incidents were reported on Friday, starting with the wrongful arrest of a CNN crew in Minneapolis and ending with the arrest of two photographers in Las Vegas. Another disturbing episode took place on Saturday, when Ian Smith, a photojournalist for KDKA TV in Pittsburgh, said he was ""attacked"" by protesters downtown. ""They stomped and kicked me,"" he wrote in a tweet from the back of an ambulance. ""I'm bruised and bloody but alive. My camera was destroyed. Another group of protesters pulled me out and saved my life. Thank you!"" Reporters by and large said they wanted the attention to be focused on the communities they cover, not on their own safety concerns. Still, the incidents provoked concern from a range of advocacy groups. ""Journalists have a clear First Amendment right to cover public events,"" Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Parker Higgins said in a statement. In Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters have been calling for accountability for a black woman who was fatally shot by police in March, an officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a reporter for WAVE 3 News, a local TV station. The incident was broadcast live on the air. ""Who are they aiming that at?"" the anchor asked. ""At us,"" the reporter replied. The reporter, Kaitlin Rust, and her cameraman were ""courageously and lawfully"" covering the news when they were targeted, the station said in a statement. ""There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances."" Louisville Metro Police Special Advisor Jessie Halladay issued an apology to Rust. Halladay said she had reviewed the video and said the incident was not something that should have occurred if Rust was singled out as a reporter. Reporters for another Louisville TV station, WLKY, were targeted by protesters on Friday night. A WLKY news vehicle was destroyed and a videojournalist ""was attacked so badly he had to go to the ER,"" anchor Julie Dolan said on Twitter. Many TV networks are dispatching private security guards to support journalists who are in the field at protests. ""These situations could have been much worse had it not been for security,"" Dolan said. Security guards were involved when a Fox News crew was harassed and chased out of Lafayette Park, one block from the White House, on Friday night. Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media. Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it."" Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called it an ""unacceptable assault on freedom of the press."" CBS correspondent Ed O'Keefe wrote on Twitter, ""Whether it's police officers or everyday Americans — keep your hands, weapons and handcuffs off of *any* journalist exercising their First Amendment right to report the news. Period."" Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a Saturday memo, obtained by CNN Business, that the company is taking ""all necessary security precautions to safeguard all of our journalists and reporting crews."" Journalists in several cities said they were exposed to tear gas and other materials used to disperse crowds. In Minneapolis, photographer and author Linda Tirado said on Twitter that she was blinded in her left eye. What ""we think happened is I took a rubber bullet to the face,"" she wrote. ""It exploded my eyeball, which has now been patched back together but who knows if it'll need more surgery. My vision is gone no matter what it winds up looking like scar wise."" In Denver, a crew from KMGH TV reported being hit with paintballs and tear gas. In Phoenix, reporter Briana Whitney was accosted by a protester while she was live on the air. ""I was intentionally tackled by this man while I was on air trying to report what was happening during the protest at Phoenix PD headquarters,"" she said at the end of the night. ""I feel violated, and this was terrifying."" In Las Vegas, two photojournalists on assignment to cover protests were taken into police custody on Friday night. Photographer Bridget Bennett told CNN Business that she was detained along with another photojournalist at the protest location. ""I'm a freelance photojournalist and was working on assignment for AFP. I was released this morning,"" Bennett said. She declined further comment. Ellen Schmidt, a staff photojournalist at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was also arrested. Review-Journal executive editor Glenn Cook said in an email message, ""it is appalling that Las Vegas police officers, who have nothing to do with what happened in Minnesota, would so forcefully take into custody two people who were obviously working photojournalists and posed no threat to law enforcement or public safety. They never should have been touched, let alone arrested and then booked into jail."" On Saturday morning, the recovery efforts began. At CNN Center, the network's flagship building in Atlanta, protesters' graffiti on the CNN logo was removed. An internal memo reassured staffers that everyone at the building was safe. UN secretary general António Guterres was moved to post a message defending the rights of the press. ""When journalists are attacked, societies are attacked,"" he tweeted Saturday morning. ""No democracy can function without press freedom nor can any society be fair without journalists who investigate wrongdoing and speak truth to power.""

One officer was injured. Two people died. Taylor said no officer discharged his or her firearm Saturday. Fatal shootings By midnight, IMPD had confirmed one fatal shooting that claimed a man's life at Talbot and Vermont streets and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. On Sunday morning, they confirmed one more death from a shooting that happened around 2:30 a.m. Sunday. One man who was shot at Market and Pennsylvania streets died at the hospital. A suspect surrendered to police in one case and was arrested, Deputy Chief Josh Barker said. Additional details on the deaths were not released. ""I don’t believe there's a single thing about young people shooting each other in our downtown streets that does a single thing to advance the cause of justice,"" Taylor said. IMPD timeline of events Barker said as evening fell two groups of several hundred people began to move around Downtown. IMPD was in the area to provide assistance and help the groups move around, Barker said. Organizers asked IMPD to ensure that there were no bad actors hiding among the peaceful protesters, Barker said. Barker said officers started observing people on the periphery of groups loading rocks and other objects into backpacks. Some were carrying shields and had medical supplies and bottles of milk to counteract chemical agents, he said. There were ""unsettling"" numbers of people armed with long guns and handguns, Barker added. After several hours, the largest group separated into smaller groups of 200 to 300 people. One group went to the City-County Building's Market Street entrance. ""It was at that point that we noticed a turn from a protester crowd to a gathering of individuals who were making overt actions to ramp up their efforts to disturb the protest,"" Barker said. Barker said people in the crowd used amber-colored lights on a vehicle to block one end of Market Street while others created a human chain ""in effect trying to disrupt"" police access. Barker said things were thrown at the City-County Building's windows and officers began to move in. Sheriff's deputies were inside the building in case of breach. At one point, a window was kicked out on Market Street, Barker said. Barker said fireworks and other objects were thrown at police officers, at which point police deployed pepper balls and tear gas. When asked about protester accounts that tear gas was used unprovoked, Barker insisted police did not move in or use chemical agents until property was damaged. After that, events quickly evolved to the use of chemical agents in other locations, Barker said. Injuries and damage There was ""extremely extensive"" damage to Downtown businesses and ""quite a number of fires,"" Barker said. Some firefighters and EMS workers also had objects thrown at them, Barker said. Barker said splinter groups dispersed through downtown of people causing the damage, firing shots into crowds and assaulting people. Order was restored to downtown about 4 a.m., according to Barker. There were no reports of widespread damage outside of Downtown. Contact IndyStar reporter Elizabeth DePompei at 317-444-6196 or edepompei@indystar.com. Follow her on Twitter: @edepompei.",0.0

NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH The man was carrying the machete to “allegedly protect his neighborhood from protesters,” police said, according to WFAA-TV. He confronted protesters while holding the machete and was then assaulted. Graphic video of the encounter was shared on social media Saturday night after what started as peaceful protests during the day turned increasingly violent as night fell. The video shows the man on the ground while a mob surrounds him. The man was kicked, punched and had rocks thrown at him. Many members of the mob scatter after the man appears to lie motionless on the ground in a pool of blood. Amid screams, people can be heard yelling, “Turn him over!” while another says, “Don’t touch him.” WOMAN BEHIND MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ATTACK ON NYPD VAN FACING FEDERAL COUNTS; 2 OTHERS CHARGED Elijah Schaffer, of Blaze TV, captured the video of the assault and shared an additional video, which shows the moments leading up to the encounter. In the video, the man appears to be walking along a sidewalk, away from protesters, who follow him while throwing what appears to be rocks in his direction. As protesters get closer, the man rushes at them while holding the machete. The large mob then collapses on the man and attacks him. Schaffer and others at the scene said the man was apparently trying to defend his store. Fox News could not immediately confirm this information. Police said the man was taken to a hospital by the time officers arrived at the scene, KTXA-TV reported. Police are continuing to investigate the incident. Hundreds of protesters looted stores and vandalized buildings throughout the night, Dallas police said. At least 74 arrests were made before midnight. They were to be charged with inciting a riot. Police also said three guns and a taser were recovered from 15 other people who were detained for vandalizing buildings after midnight.

The Atlanta Police Department said on Twitter the incident happened around 10:30 p.m., after a person was riding in the area struck the officer on the 200 block of Ted Turner Drive in the city’s downtown. “I thought he was dead,” Tony Heard, who witnessed the incident, told FOX5. GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: THE CITIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING AND RIOTING The officer had been stationed at the intersection to block traffic from going onto Marietta Street as protests continued in downtown Atlanta when an ATV sped past. A few moments later, police told FOX5 the ATV returned to the intersection and hit the officer. Officials have not yet said if the incident was intentional. The person on the ATV sustained minor injures and was taken into custody. The rider has not yet been charged. The officer, an 18-year veteran of the department, sustained significant injuries to his legs and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital. He underwent surgery, but his condition was reported to be stable as of Sunday morning. Police told WSB-TV the officer was trying to keep protesters from being hit by cars who were lingering in downtown Atlanta after a 9 p.m. curfew. The incident happened the second night of protests that turned violent in Atlanta. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms said Sunday that 157 people were arrested Saturday night, and she will decide whether to extend a nighttime curfew. NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH Atlanta police made arrests after protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is expanding a state of emergency to authorize the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to protests in cities across the state. Kemp said he was prepared to send Guard soldiers to Athens, Savannah and any other Georgia cities where demonstrations were planned Sunday. “Hopefully we don’t have to,” the Republican governor told WSB-TV late Saturday. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” Kemp said. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there … to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

1621639692,2020-05-31 05:40:23,Tuesday's largely mail-in primary in Indiana is shaping up to be unique,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/31/tuesdays-largely-mail-primary-indiana-shaping-up-unique/5265585002/,en,False,,336377,indiana.statenews.net,http://indiana.statenews.net/,"Tuesday's primary will be unlike any we've seen in Indiana. It's a good bet more than half of you will have cast your ballots by the time the polls open, due to the expansion of absentee voting amid coronavirus concerns. Many of you who do venture out Tuesday will find fewer polling places, workers wearing protective gear and lines stretching out longer than they look due to social distancing. There's cause to worry some of those absentee ballots will arrive too late to be counted. With an increasing number of Marion County voters complaining their ballots arrived late this week or haven't come at all, Clerk Myla Eldridge sent a letter Thursday to the Secretary of State urging the Indiana Election Commission extend the deadline to receive ballots back by mail. She says it's clear thousands of voters will be disenfranchised, but at this point, the deadline remains noon Tuesday. In an evolving public spat, Secretary of State Connie Lawson blamed Marion County for a lack of preparation and said she won't change deadlines for one county. While some of those voters who planned to vote absentee might now vote in person, no one is expecting record-shattering turnout because the top-of-the-ticket races are uncontested. President Trump and Joe Biden wrapped up their nominations months ago. Gov. Holcomb is running unopposed for a second term and Dr. Woody Myers' potential Democratic opponents dropped out long ago. The top races for some Hoosiers will be for Congress — especially in the districts of the retiring Susan Brooks and Pete Visclosky. For others, the most interesting names on the ballot will be for county office. Primary voters won't have a say in one of the most compelling races. Former Congressman Todd Rokita has jumped into the mix to replace Attorney General Curtis Hill, an estranged Republican whom Gov. Holcomb has been unable to toss from the ticket. Hill's fate will be decided by Republican state delegates, who will mail in their own votes after the June 18 virtual state convention. Hill won't be the only candidate who will have to wait to learn his fate, though certainly he'll have the longest wait. Many election boards have been warning they don't expect final results Tuesday — especially in larger counties and in competitive Congressional districts that cross political borders. Election workers in many counties will tally all of those absentee ballots into Wednesday and potentially beyond. Now one can say precisely how long before every race has been called. Potentially just a day. Possibly several. At worst, probably a week, though counties have nearly two weeks, until June 12. Also different: The way in which the winners celebrate and launch their November campaigns. While a few candidates are planning small watch parties on Election Night, there will be no rousing victory speeches with packed ballroom parties as a backdrop. No photos of handshakes and high fives from supporters. No touching pictures of hugs and kisses from kids and spouses in front of large crowds. Tuesday, the most likely story will be what it all looked like and how it went. ""I know for my friends who are interested in politics,"" said Robert Dion, a political science professor at the University of Evansville, ""if they sit down on Election Night with a beer and they want to see who's winning, they are not going to know."" 546,000 to vote by mail Roughly 546,000 Hoosiers have requested mail-in ballots in the past few weeks, an extraordinary number 10 times higher than four years ago. In 2016, more than 1.7 million voted in the presidential primary, but only about 53,800 of those by mail. That was a historic night with high turnout. Trump wrapped up his nomination against a lingering Ted Cruz. Bernie Sanders defeated eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, forcing her to continue campaigning for several weeks. Trump won't be here Tuesday. Neither will Biden. Holcomb and Myers aren't planning watch parties. The governor is keeping focused on Indiana's reopening amid the coronavirus. Myers is trying to figure out how to gain traction — and raise cash — without campaigning in person. The last year Indiana had such a ho-hum presidential and gubernatorial primary, in 2012, only some 957,500 Hoosiers voted. President Obama was seeking a second term and Mitt Romney had all but wrapped up the GOP nomination. Mike Pence, at the time a firebrand conservative congressman, and former House Speaker John Gregg were both uncontested in their gubernatorial primaries. There's cause to think Tuesday might produce an even lower turnout than in 2012, perhaps much lower if this election hadn't been buoyed by the option for mail-in voting. Republicans eight years ago had a top of the ticket Senate race — tea party favorite Richard Mourdock's historic defeat of longtime Sen. Richard Lugar. While Democrats in some areas might be especially motivated to vote as a protest to President Trump, pundits think it's most likely only the most reliable voters who will turn out. ""Seniors or those close to being seniors are the ones most likely to vote,"" said Nadia Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University. ""Black women are more likely to turn out. I'm really concerned that those who win on Tuesday will see their winning as a referendum or mandate to govern, and it definitely is not."" Absentee balloting hasn't been all smooth It's difficult to say how absentee balloting will go. There's cause to think the ease of voting will somewhat bolster turnout while protecting folks from COVID-19. That said, there's also reason to think there will be problems. Never before, have as many as half a million Hoosiers voted by mail in one election. That's a lot of ballots to mail out and count. It's hard to say how it will go. In Marion County, about 124,000 want to vote by mail. Clerk Eldridge says her staff has processed 123,000 of those, but she says the post office has taken weeks to deliver many ballots to voters. She said her staff also only had 10 people to process all of those application in the early weeks of the pandemic, a number that's now risen to 100. ""In short,"" she wrote to the Secretary of State, ""this could mean that thousands of ballots will remain uncounted despite the best efforts of the Marion County Election Board and the voters themselves."" The Secretary of State sent a letter back saying Marion County waited too long to shift into high gear and should have reached out sooner for help. ""Lack of prior planning and preparation are no reason to change deadlines,"" she wrote. Judging by the folks who have been reaching out to IndyStar, voters are worried their votes won't be counted. In some cases, they say ballots took weeks to arrive. In other cases, election officials say they never received the applications. Other voters are worried the ballots came so late there won't be time to mail them back. It's left many unsure what to do. Carl Scott, 67, and John Stubblefield, 60, were among several voters who told IndyStar in a story that ran May 19 they had requested but had not received absentee ballots weeks prior. The ballots finally came on May 23, nearly three weeks after the two submitted applications. Marion County received the applications May 7 and mailed them out May 8, according to the clerk's office. It's unclear what happened. ""My concern with all of this is that people may be put in a position where they cannot vote,"" Scott said. ""Eventually I would love to see the whole country being able to vote by mail. Obviously they need to get this worked out."" Such anecdotal stories abound and it's unclear how widespread of an issue that will be in or beyond Marion County. The Secretary of State's Office notes absentee ballots also can be turned into the county clerk's office prior to election day. You also can vote in person, but you'll have to fill out paperwork to confirm you didn't vote absentee. You can check the status of your ballot at www.IndianaVoters.com. ""Because of the high number of absentee ballots in this year’s primary,"" said Secretary of State spokesman Ian Hauer in a news release, ""the U.S. Postal Service is under a high level of strain, and voters may wish to consider alternate methods for returning their ballot."" Most counties required voters to send an application for an absentee ballot. A few mailed absentee ballots to every voter, a strategy that appeared to be effective. Boone County, for example, mailed applications to 46,000 registered voters and about 12,700 responded they will vote by mail. That's more than in both Johnson (about 11,700) and Hendricks (about 10,300) counties, which are each more than twice as populous as Boone. Hamilton County will put aside however many of the nearly 40,000 absentee ballots workers haven't counted at 5 p.m. Tuesday and start again Wednesday morning. To help with social distancing, election officials want to get those workers out of the county judicial center before poll workers finish up and come in. Some counties, like Allen County in Fort Wayne, won't even start counting absentee ballots until Wednesday and have warned it could take days. Allen County mailed out nearly 40,000 ballots, a huge chunk of the potential vote. Keeping things safe Many counties will have far fewer places to vote. Marion County will have 22, instead of the usual 250. St. Joseph County, home of South Bend, will have 12 voting locations. It usually has more than 120. ""With fewer polling places and limited volunteers, long lines are a concern, as is the risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19,"" said Elizabeth Bennion, a politics professor at Indiana University-South Bend. The Secretary of State has sent personal protective equipment such as hand sanitizer, dispenser bottles, disinfectant, microfiber cloths, gloves and masks to local election offices. That office also has asked poll workers to wear masks, wash their hands and sanitize equipment and tables regularly, require social distancing and wear gloves when handling paper. Each county will handle coronavirus concerns in different ways. Many clerks say voters will stand in line spread out by marks on the ground — just like the check out lines at grocery stores. Election officials are asking voters to wear masks and to socially distance, though their lawyers note they cannot require anyone to do so under Indiana law. ""While voters are strongly encouraged to follow CDC guidelines,"" a memo from the Secretary of State to election offices reads, ""such as wearing cloth face coverings and socially distance when in public spaces, coughing or sneezing into their elbow, and regularly washing hands with soap and water (use hand sanitizer), in the view of the Election Division, these cannot be pre-conditions for a voter to cast their ballot on Election Day."" The letter also says election officials can't ban campaign volunteers from appearing outside voting places; you know, the folks wearing candidate buttons and handing out fliers. But you can ask them to stay 6 feet away. ""A voter who feels harassed, endangered or otherwise harmed by a volunteer not heeding to their request should direct matters to local law enforcement,"" the letter says. To avoid the risks, election officials everywhere hope voters got the message — vote by mail. ""I think it's going to be a very slow day when you look at the actual number of people showing up,"" said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics in Fort Wayne. ""I think that it will also be incredibility frustrating because of how slowly results will trickle in."" Contact IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at Chris.Sikich@indystar.com.

(WEHT)- The Evansville Police Department says 28-year-old Andrew Barnett fired one shot at officers during a foot pursuit Saturday evening before being taken into custody. Officers initially responded to a report of a man with a gun near an apartment complex on the 2700 block of Lodge Ave. The caller reportedly identified the man as Barnett, who police say is a parole registered offender for attempted armed burglary and intimidation. In a release, Evansville Police say Barnett took off on foot when officers tried to make contact. One officer reportedly tried using a taser but was unsuccessful, but another officer also tried deploying a taser and hit Barnett’s arm. Barnett reportedly then pulled a revolver from his waistband and shot once at officers before falling to the ground and being taken into custody.

1621651489,2020-05-31 12:29:13,Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has passionate plea to protesters,https://www.wishtv.com/news/national/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-has-passionate-plea-to-protesters/,en,False,,25139,wishtv.com,http://www.wishtv.com,"Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has passionate plea to protesters (CNN) — Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms stepped into the national spotlight on Friday night, denouncing vandalism in her city as “chaos” after demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer now charged with his murder, turned violent and destructive. “What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” an impassioned Bottoms said at a news conference. “This is chaos.” As thousands of protesters gathered in more than thirty cities, the Atlanta mayor, whose name has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, is facing a high stakes test of her leadership at home. Bottoms was joined at the news conference by local hip hop artists, civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Bernice King, and law enforcement officials, as she mixed empathy with anger and pleaded with protesters to “go home.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said he issued a state of emergency overnight at Bottoms’ request that could send as many as 500 National Guard troops to Fulton County. Rising star in the Democratic Party Bottoms, a former judge and city council member, was sworn in as mayor in 2018 and has quickly emerged as one of the Democratic Party’s rising stars. On Friday night, amid a swirl of increasingly tense and occasionally violent scenes, she faced the cameras, her constituents — and the country. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old. And when I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother would hurt,” Bottoms said. “And yesterday when I heard there were rumors about violent protests in Atlanta, I did what a mother would do, I called my son and I said, ‘Where are you?’ I said, ‘I cannot protect you and black boys shouldn’t be out today.'” She stopped for a moment, pursed her lips, and then delivered a frank and personal message. “So, you’re not going to out-concern me and out-care about where we are in America,” Bottoms said. “I wear this each and every day, and I pray over my children, each and every day.” The daughter of 1960s R&B star Major Lance, Keisha Lance Bottoms, a self-described “daughter of Atlanta” and its public schools, attended Florida A&M, a historically black university in Tallahassee, as an undergrad before returning home to obtain her law degree from Georgia State University. By the time she was elected the city’s 60th mayor — and second woman to hold the office — in a run-off following a race that initially featured more than a dozen candidates, Bottoms’ name was on the mind of party operatives and pundits well outside Atlanta. Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday about Trump’s threat to use the military against protesters, an exasperated Bottoms said she wished Trump would simply stay silent. “He should just stop talking. This is like Charlottesville all over again,” Bottoms said on “State of the Union.” “He speaks and he makes it worse. There are times when you should just be quiet and I wish that he would just be quiet. Or if he can’t be silent, if there is somebody of good sense and good conscience in the White House, put him in front of a teleprompter and pray he reads it and at least says the right things, because he is making it worse.” CNN reached out to the White House for response to Bottoms’ comments on Sunday. In early July of 2019, Bottoms spoke out forcefully against planned Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Atlanta, and other cities, telling CNN at the time that her city was “not complicit in what’s happening.” She dismissed the federal targeting of migrants as a means of reducing crime, as the Trump administration has often framed it, and said her office would provide legal assistance to immigrant families, in English and Spanish, and warned those communities to be vigilant ahead of the scheduled sweeps. “Our officers don’t enforce immigration borders,” Bottoms said. “We’ve closed our city detention centers to ICE because we don’t want to be complicit in family separation.” A few weeks earlier, in late June, Bottoms made a memorable appearance in Miami, where she attended Biden’s first Democratic presidential primary debate as a guest of the candidate’s wife, Jill. In the aftermath, as the political world calculated the damage Sen. Kamala Harris had done to Biden with her attack on his past position on busing, another piece of news crossed mostly unnoticed: Bottoms had officially endorsed Biden. From there on, she became one of his strongest surrogates, attending other debates and standing by his side even as the polls showed Biden slipping ahead of the first round of voting this year. “He is a strong candidate and there have been some bumps along the way, but I think that’s to be expected. Nobody ever said it would be easy,” Bottoms told Atlanta’s 11Alive news in November 2019, touting Biden’s strong standing in the state. “When you look at the legacy that the Obama-Biden administration has in Georgia, people remember that and especially when you look at large groups of people of color as a demographic in our state then, by and large, especially our seasoned African American voters, are solidly behind Joe Biden.” Bottoms’ assessment of a campaign still in flux would be proven out over the coming months, as African American voters, especially older members of the community in states like South Carolina, helped revive Biden’s campaign and vault him to the front of the primary pack. By April, he had consolidated the field and emerged as the party’s presumptive nominee. In a statement Saturday, Biden campaign national spokesman TJ Ducklo applauded Bottoms’ grace under fire. “Vice President Biden has been grateful for Mayor Bottoms’ support and counsel since the earliest days of our campaign,” Ducklo said. “Her passion, her empathy and her strong and steady leadership are shining through during this difficult moment, and the city of Atlanta is lucky to have her leading the way.” Bottoms ‘spoke to us from the heart’ Sarah Riggs Amico, who ran alongside Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in 2018 as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, praised Bottoms on Saturday morning for her message and moral authority. “Mayor Bottoms spoke to us from the heart not just as a leader, but as a mother of four black children, reminding us that the safety and freedom of our families and our community must remain our primary collective focus,” said Amico, who is running in Georgia’s Democratic Senate primary on June 9. The protests in Atlanta had started peacefully Friday afternoon, when crowds gathered in the city’s famed Centennial Park. But by 6 p.m. ET, demonstrators began moving toward the front of the CNN Center, where police had gathered. Over the next few hours, the gathering swelled as SWAT officers were called in to confront the crowds. Later, protesters could be seen damaging the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta, which is sandwiched between State Farm Arena and Centennial Park. In response, Bottoms referenced CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, who earlier Friday had been arrested — and then released about an hour later — while covering protests over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. “There was a black reporter who was arrested on camera this morning, who works for CNN. They are telling our stories, and you are disgracing their building,” she said. “We are no longer talking about the murder of an innocent man. We’re talking about how you’re burning police cars on the streets of Atlanta, Georgia.” Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like New York and Washington into chants, signs and occasional outbreaks of disorder, smashing windows and setting vehicles ablaze. Police in New York were also captured on video posted to social media lashing out violently at protesters in Brooklyn. “A protest has purpose. When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn’t do this to our city,” Bottoms said in Atlanta. “If you want change in America, go and register to vote … That is the change we need in this country.”",0.0

He’s going to speak his truth, and he’s not going to stop. “We have to be true to who we are and our voices,” Towns said on ESPN’s SportsCenter. “We have to use those voices to impact people, and there is a huge dilemma in this country right now that needs to be addressed and I won’t shut up. I won’t stop. I will continue to use my voice to speak out for the people who are unheard, and that’s what I did. “A voice is so important, and when I say voice I’m not talking about speaking, per se. I’m talking about actions. I’m talking about going out and protesting and doing your duty as a member of this democracy.” A Harvard graduate who transferred to Ohio State after excelling both athletically and academically at nearby Northland High School, Towns spent time in a police van Friday after being part of a downtown protest following the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis on Monday. For the first time since the incident, Towns told his side of what took place. “I was protesting like everyone else,” he said. “It was a peaceful protest in the street. They were telling us to back up. They just came up and about six cops put me in handcuffs and put me in the back of a paddy wagon. I don’t regret anything. We have to be heard, and this is a very serious issue and I won’t stop.” Video of the encounter shows Towns shouting, “Say his name!” repeatedly. Once inside the back of the van, Towns said two things stuck out to him. “One, the solidarity I felt, the pain I felt amongst all the other protestors,” he said. “There was no malice involved. They were just out there expressing their pain and demanding justice, which again, is their duty. The second thing, looking in the eyes of those police officers, each one standing on the front line. To many, it was just another day on the job and they felt no remorse. They felt no empathy, no sympathy for the people who are struggling out there, painfully protesting. “And then the others who are also very scared. You could tell. You can look in their eyes and tell. There were many police officers who did not want to be there.” After news of the Friday incident began to spread Saturday, multiple people around Towns took to social media to express support for his actions. Tommy Amaker, his coach at Harvard, released a statement to Twitter that said, in part, “I fully support, and am proud of, Seth in his continued fight for social justice, a cause that has been near and dear to his heart since he arrived on campus four years ago.” New Ohio State guard Abel Porter, a transfer from Utah State, posted his support for his new teammate. Once Towns released his statement, Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann released one of his own, saying “We fully support our players’ right to peacefully protest,” Holtmann said. “In the time I’ve gotten to know Seth, it’s clear that he has a heart for social justice.” Athletic director Gene Smith chimed in, too, tweeting, “Proud of you, Seth!” Towns had posted a video and multiple messages to Twitter, pointing out that he had gone from graduating from Harvard to being in the back of a police van in the span of 24 hours – “both of which I am equally proud of,” he said. Going forward, Towns said he plans to continue to use his status as an athlete to address issues like racial injustice but added that they can’t do it alone. “I think athletes have a unique platform to speak up for what’s wrong and to speak as a voice of the people,” he said. “People look up to athletes for several reasons and with this platform you have a responsibility.

Trump is en route to Kennedy Space Center for the SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (CNN) — A serious divide has emerged among Donald Trump’s top allies and advisers over how the President should address several nights of protests and riots across the nation following the death of George Floyd. Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations. Trump has adopted an uneven message on the demonstrations. While in some appearances he has taken a measured approach in calling for calm, on Twitter he has used violent rhetoric and seemed to suggest Saturday his supporters stage a counter-protest outside the White House. Over the weekend, some aides sought to convince Trump against using violent rhetoric after he wrote on Twitter that “when the looting starts the shooting starts,” warning language like that could inflame an already combustible situation and would not appear presidential. During a staff call Friday, Trump’s top domestic policy aide Brooke Rollins argued for a measured response to riots the night before, advice that was echoed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Several advisers feared, and hoped to avoid, another Charlottesville moment, when Trump was criticized after declaring in 2017 that “very fine people” were among the Nazi mobs that descended upon Charlottesville, Virginia. When the President made his first vague statement on that violence, he blamed the conflicts on “many sides.” Trump, who believes his law and order stance helped get him elected, wasn’t immediately receptive to those concerns over the last several days about what’s currently happening in the nation. But he later tried to downplay his message about using armed force on looters as a statement rather than a threat. The next day, Trump had revived some of the violent imagery by evoking dogs and weaponry at the ready inside the White House gates, despite the earlier encouragement from his advisers to tone down his language. While aides like Kushner have pushed for a more restrained response, Trump is also hearing from several advisers who warned that by not condemning the protests after the death of Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old black man, that turned into rioting and looting, he is risking losing some demographics that will be key to his election victory in November, like suburban women voters. Trump has been told he should more forcefully denounce those spray painting buildings, looting Targets and setting cities on fire — and that he hasn’t done so nearly enough. As aides debate how and whether to confront the situation, Trump’s back-and-forth between violent rhetoric and a more measured tone has weighed in the deliberations, one official said. Some advisers wonder whether a presidential address calling for calm would be quickly erased by Trump’s own penchant for escalation and instigation. On Sunday, a Fox News host called for Trump to address the nation. “I really believe it is time for President Trump to do an Oval Office address,” Griff Jenkins said on Fox and Friends. National security adviser Robert O’Brien on Sunday left open the possibility of an Oval Office address, but did not rule out the other options under consideration for the President. “He’ll continue to communicate with the American people, whether it’s an address from the Oval or speaking from the podium at the White House or, as he does on a daily basis, talking to the American people over social media,” O’Brien told reporters at the White House. Trump has been hesitant to hold another Oval address after his last one regarding the coronavirus was widely panned. Within minutes, Trump made several inaccurate claims that his administration was later forced to clarify. Since January, the coronavirus pandemic has taken the lives of more than 103,000 Americans, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University. However, Trump appears to have heard the concerns about how he’s handled the protests and violence across the nation so far. Trump wasn’t expected to address Minnesota at length while in Florida for a space launch Saturday, but then aides added several minutes of remarks to his speech. “My administration will stop mob violence, and stop it cold,” Trump vowed on stage Saturday.",0.0

During a midmorning press conference, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief Josh Barker said the damage overnight Saturday was ""extremely extensive."" A weekend total provided by the city's tourism arm, Downtown Indy, put the number at more than 80 businesses. Businesses were vandalized and looted overnight after peaceful protests once again gave way to chaos after sundown. Police clashed with demonstrators who are angry over the deaths of black men and women by police across the U.S. IMPD officials said they received numerous calls about looting, small fires across Downtown and vandalism. The destruction, they and other city officials said, was caused by a small groups of rioters. ""Rocks and other projectiles were thrown. Business were vandalized and looted. Government buildings were targeted. Fires were repeatedly set with the intention of doing harm,"" Mayor Joe Hogsett said during a news conference. ""In the chaos that ensued, significant damage has been done to our downtown. Once more we awaken to a morning defined by unproductive destruction instead of a meaning dialogue our city requires."" The day before local business leaders had urged for calm and an end to vandalism and looting after the first night of peaceful protests unraveled. A CVS drugstore had been set ablaze. T-Mobile, TJ Maxx and other businesses were broken into and their goods looted. Windows broken. Preliminary projections from Downtown Indy. Inc. placed damages from the first night of protest in the millions of dollars. But the pleas of business leaders were unheeded. By Sunday morning, the additional destruction could be seen across Downtown from the state Capitol to Mass. Ave. and Delaware Street. Graffiti messages such as ""No Justice No Peace"" and ""Can you hear us now?"" and ""BLM,"" the acronym for Black Lives Matter, were written in black and red paint on buildings across downtown. Officials said at least 30 businesses were vandalized during the first night of protests. By Sunday, that list had grown to include Charles Schwab on North Meridian, a Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy on Massachusetts Avenue, Stouts Footwear, The Whit apartments, and Whole Foods Market on East Market Street. Whole Foods confirmed that the Downtown store had received some damage during the rioting. It was completely boarded up by Sunday afternoon and set to close early. Business owners such as Tony Cento, owner of Cento Shoes on Meridian Street, said the shoe repair business had been vandalized and looted during both nights of rioting. Merchandise had been taken the first night, but the damage on the second night was much worse. ""The first time it was a broken window and more merchandise, but what made it tough on this one is that they went into the back and started destroying the machines,"" Cento said. Glass windows and walls were broken and shattered at Qdoba, Five Guys, Au Bon Pain, Salesforce Tower, Chipotle, Champs, Rock Bottom, and Helium Night Club, among other places. Nearby on Monument Circle, cracked glass fragmented a window advertisement at MyEyeDr. Businesses, assisted by city crews and volunteers, worked to clean up glass and debris. Up and down Meridian Street, strips of businesses had been boarded up by Sunday afternoon, including Napolese and the Oceanaire Seafood Room. Down the street at First National Bank, entire personal offices were exposed as people worked to board up windows. One street over on Illinois, windows were broken at McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood & Steaks and explicit graffiti covered the building’s exterior. A sign posted outside of Buca de Beppo warned restaurant goers that the restaurant, which had at least one broken window, was closed. “Unfortunately due to the recent protests in close proximity to our restaurant,” the sign read, “we have made the decision to close until we can responsibly and safely celebrate with you again.” Contact IndyStar reporter Alexandria Burris at aburris@gannett.com or call 317-617-2690.

The mayor made the announcement during a press conference with IMPD Chief Randal Taylor regarding the past two nights of protesting in the city. During the news conference, Hogsett said the curfew will be enforced by the authorities, with exceptions made for those traveling to and from work, seeking medical care, or fleeing from dangerous circumstances; law enforcement; members of the news media; federal, state, or local public officials conducting necessary work; and individuals experiencing homelessness. The curfew is in response to the violence that erupted in the city Saturday night after peaceful protests during the daytime. “Rocks and other projectiles were thrown, businesses were vandalized and looted, government buildings were targeted, fires were repeatedly set with the intention of doing harm,” said Hogsett. “Guns were pulled and deadly violence was directed with wanton disregard for other civilians. “It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protestors or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,” he said. “That is why this morning I will sign an executive order instituting a countywide curfew and red travel orders that will take effect at 8 p.m this evening and last through 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. Under this order all residents are required to be home by 8 p.m. and to stay home for their own safety.” The Indiana Department of Transportation announced the following Interstate ramps into downtown Indianapolis will be closed: I-70 WB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 SB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 NB to Washington St I-65 NB/SB to MLK Additionally, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced that he had directed the Indiana National Guard to coordinate with the Indiana State Police in securing state properties in downtown Indianapolis. Some graffiti was sprayed on the pedestals of statues facing east from the Statehouse. The Indiana Soldiers & Sailors Monument, the site of several rallies recently, was also tagged with the names of persons who recently died in police action shootings both in Indiana and nationally. Saturday’s rally was attended by more than a thousand people who marched peacefully from the Indiana War Memorial to the Circle in a call for an end to perceived racial injustice at the hands of law enforcement and concluded before 7 p.m. per an agreement with the mayor’s office. IMPD reported that 29 people were arrested overnight. Two people were killed in shootings overnight as well, one of which happened near the intersection of North Pennsylvania and East Market Street and the other in the 3700 block of Orchard Avenue, on Indy’s near northeast side. Earlier in the evening, IMPD officers in dressed in tactical gear responded to Market Street outside the City-County Building after a protester broke a first-floor window. “We observed individuals loading rocks and other objects into backpacks. There were individuals who were carrying shields and other implements to protect themselves from any law enforcement tactics we may have to employ,” said IMPD Deputy Chief Josh Barker. “We observed an unsettling number of individuals armed with various types of long guns, shotguns, handguns and the like.” FOX59 watched as protest organizers attempted to regain control of the demonstration after the window was broken, moving the crowd away from the front of the CCB, pointing to the east and the nearby Whole Foods at Market and Alabama Streets. The mood of crowd changed and became more confrontational as Barker said rocks, frozen water bottles and other projectiles were launched at police. “Our intention in the very beginning was to create a buffer or an area of deniability, if you will, to get those rioters back away from the building to prevent additional damage to the City-County Building and keep them from entering that building with an overwhelming number,” said Barker, recounting how his police move toward the crowd. “They immediately started getting rocks thrown at the officers. Rioters in the crowd had firecrackers and other incendiary type devices that they were lighting on fire and throwing at our officers. They then began to damage some of the police vehicles that had pulled up in the periphery. “It was not until that point several hours into this successful protest that IMPD initially used pepper ball and chemical agents to begin to disperse that crowd that had gathered in front of the City-County Building.” FOX59 News observed several protesters placed under arrest outside the Whole Foods store and spotted tear gas clouds rising in the vicinity of 251 East Ohio Street near the offices of the Marion County Prosecutor where first floor windows were broken. IMPD Chief Randy Taylor was asked if groups like Antifa, which President Trump said he would designate as a terrorist group, were involved in the organizing the riots. “Obviously I know that there were people in the crowds that were not from the Indianapolis area,” said Taylor. “I don’t know if that particular group was involved. I wouldn’t be surprised if that was confirmed but we do know that there were people here specifically to cause chaos and trouble.” “In the chaos that ensued, significant damage was done to our downtown. Once more we awake to a morning defined by unproductive destruction.” The mayor’s office stated that violation of the curfew order is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and fines worth up to $10,000. “This policy is not intended to punish our residents – it is intended to protect them,” said Hogsett. “We also remain committed to protecting the peaceful demonstrations we fully expect will take place today and in the weeks to come. We do not tolerate these acts of protest – we celebrate them. And just as with yesterday, we will continue to work with event organizers to ensure they have a venue to deliver their non-violent message without interference.”",0.0

(Photo By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that the United States will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization, even though the US government has no existing legal authority to label a wholly domestic group in the manner it currently designates foreign terrorist organizations. The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Current and former government officials say it would be unconstitutional for the US government to proscribe First Amendment-protected activity inside the US based on simple ideology. US law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn’t enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get out their messages. An additional problem with the President’s claim is that groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don’t have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for US law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. The President’s call for a terrorist designation comes as Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr have pointed to far-left groups as responsible for many of the violent protests across the country. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations. An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though US law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. Trump’s and Barr’s focus on left-leaning groups also stands in contrast with repeated warnings in recent years from US law enforcement that the rise of white supremacist groups has become the biggest domestic terrorism challenge. Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has raised concerns about the increase of white supremacist activity driving the domestic terror threat — in some cases surpassing that from foreign terrorist groups. In response to the President’s tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is “no legal authority for designating a domestic group” as a terrorist organization. “As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.” The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort. Despite threats by the President to designate various groups as terrorists, the closest the Trump administration has come is, in recent weeks, the State Department’s designation of a white supremacist group called Russian Imperial Movement, which is a foreign group but has some domestic US supporters, as a specially designated global terrorist group. What is Antifa? Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn’t have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the “radical ideals” promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. “They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.” The majority of Antifa members don’t fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters. How did the group start? The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism atCalifornia State University, San Bernardino. “What they’re trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,” Levin said. Where do they protest? Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country. In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer. Earlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the “Black Bloc.” They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting. Why are they controversial? The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held. Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence. “There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,” Crow said. Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because “they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.” “There’s this ‘It’s going down’ mentality and this ‘Hit them with your boots’ mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,” he added. White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the “alt-left.” Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent. Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalistwho attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are “just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.” “These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don’t see right-wing protests get like this,” Cvjetanovic told CNN affiliate KRNV. But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. “The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that. “And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don’t believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.”",0.0

Sign up here. Minnesota’s governor and the mayors of the Twin Cities pledged their support to fight against the “systemic racism” that they said led to the death of George Floyd after another night of violent rioting in Minneapolis and other metropolitan areas around the country. Gov. Tim Walz thanked those who obeyed the nighttime curfew to give law enforcement the space to restore order without further loss of life, saying, “the gift they have given us, is that the sun came up this morning to open up the space for the real conversation. A real understanding that George Floyd was dead and the conditions here, in Minnesota, contributed to that.” “It does fall to myself, other elected leaders, community leaders and others that if we do not get to that systemic problem, eventually this will get us back to a point that led to our communities on fire, our security and safety in question and a searching of who we are,” Waltz said. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The city’s curfew was from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday, and several freeways were to remain closed to all but emergency responders and law enforcement to keep protesters from coming into the Minneapolis metropolitan area from out of town. “Law enforcement made several arrests and seized weapons, narcotics, long guns, handguns, magazines and knives,” Walz said.”We have reason to believe that bad actors continue to infiltrate the rightful protests of George Floyd’s murder, which is why we are extending the curfew by one day.” St. Paul, Minn., Mayor Melvin Carter said he was not encouraging people to be patient or passive in their fight for justice, but urged the public to channel what he called their “nuclear energy” into not destroying neighborhoods. “[But] to destroy the historic culture, to destroy the systemic racism, to destroy, in specifics where this is concerned, the laws, legal precedents, police union contracts, all of the things that make it so difficult to hold someone accountable when a life, like George Floyd’s, is so wrongfully taken,” he continued. MINNESOTA AG ELLISON SAY HE HAS EVIDENCE OF OUTSIDERS CONTRIBUTING TO RIOTS WHILE CALLING OUT ‘ENDEMIC PROBLEM’ WITH MINNEAPOLIS POLICE “We can either channel this energy into destroying our own communities, toward burning and looting our barbershops, our restaurants, our family-owned businesses. The lives and livelihoods that have gone into all those institutions. Or we can take this energy and channel it into building a better future,” Carter said. “We know that right now is a moment of deep soul searching for our community and for our nation. Right now we ought to be focused on the fact that George Floyd ought to still be alive today,” he continued. “We ought to be focused on the fact that when someone takes one of our lives in such dramatic and gruesome fashion, especially when it’s as well documented as George Floyd’s murder was, that we ought to have some ability to be confident, to be sure that the people will be held responsible. “Not just one — but the four people who were responsible for his death, in a democracy as great as ours, that the four people responsible for his death will of course be held to account,” Carter said. After recent speculation over whether rioters were Minneapolis locals or were part of an organized group who had come from out of town in incite violence, Carter said: “The one thing that’s absolutely clear to me is that those folks who would seek to act in a way that during a pandemic, would deprive our senior citizens of the local pharmacy they need to go to to get their life-saving medicine, who in the midst of a food shortage, would deprive our families of the grocery stores they need to go to to feed their children… “Who would deprive, in the middle of one of the worst economic crises in our country’s history, our workers from the opportunity to go to work and to earn a living and to participate in our economy, the one thing that is clear to me is that those folks are not driven, those actions are not driven by a sense of deep drive for the betterment of our community,” the mayor said. MINNESOTA CHARITY FOUNDER SPEAKS OUT ON DESTRUCTION FROM GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS: ‘WE NEED PEACE’ “Today we’re asking our community for peace, but I want to be very clear we’re not asking you for patience. And we are not asking you for pacifism,” Carter continued. “I am not asking you to sit to the side and patiently wait as we slowly and incrementally stem the bloody tide of African-American men killed by law enforcement.” Waltz said Minnesota for years has been ranked among the best U.S. states to live in — unless you are black. “All those statistics, if you peel it back, are true if you’re white. If you’re not, we rank near the bottom. Which this week has shown all of us that those two things can’t operate at the same place. You cannot continue to say, Minnesota is a great place to live if your neighbor,because of the color of their skin, does not have that same opportunity,” the governor said. He also commended Lt. Gov. Flanagan, who recently spoke on race issues “in her elegant words as an indigenous woman who understands what that means,” Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was “on the streets begging people to come home,” and rapper and music mogul Jay-Z, who called the governor last night “not as an international performer, but a dad stressing to me that justice needs to be served,” for trusting him to listen to what they were saying and work toward change.

Thousands of protesters turned out across the Windy City on Saturday night, gathering on the Loop and other downtown areas to demonstrate against police brutality. Hundreds sat or took a knee on Lake Shore Drive as they moved toward the river. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown told reporters that Saturday night’s riot resulted in 240 arrests, with six people shot and one dead after a “verbal exchange escalated to gunfire.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced new measures Sunday morning, citing concerns over the fallout of the riots. “I saw officers pelted with bottles and debris,” she said during her Sunday morning press conference. The mayor had declared a curfew from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, with many ignoring it as protests continued. Chicago will also restrict vehicle and transit access downtown, and Lightfoot has called in the National Guard to support local law enforcement in anticipation of further protests. The city will also suspend its downtown public transit to discourage protesters’ ability to gather, according to FOX 32 Chicago. The city curfew will remain in effect on Sunday night. The CPD initially attempted to stamp down protest efforts by raising several of the bridges connecting the downtown areas so that protesters could not cross. The bridges remained raised on Sunday morning. Not all was doom and gloom on Sunday morning. Volunteers took to the streets on Sunday morning to help clean up the broken glass, burned-out cars and shattered debris that resulted from the protests. Garbage littered the streets, as seen in video and images posted to social media. “I needed to do something,” Michelle Eleby, a Chicago resident, said. “We can’t sit back and hope the solution is going to come.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

The shooting occurred on Friday after a vehicle pulled up outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at about 9:45 p.m. and a person opened fire at two contract security officers who worked for Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. Underwood was killed while the second officer was wounded and remains in critical condition. His identity has not yet been released. FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE OFFICER KILLED, ANOTHER INJURED IN OAKLAND SHOOTING AMID GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS “When someone targets a police officer or a police station with an intention to do harm and intimidate — that is an act of domestic terrorism,” Department of Homeland Security Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said at a Washington, D.C., news conference Saturday. “There are currently threats by some to attack police stations and federal buildings,” Cuccinelli said. “That violence not only won’t be tolerated, we are also committed to ensuring that it won’t succeed anywhere.” Officers around the country have been facing a barrage of violent attacks in recent days since the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a former Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. Floyd’s death on Memorial Day has created an outcry from people protesting police brutality, and some protesters have resorted to violent tactics to avenge his death. LAWYER FOR GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY WANTS CHARGES AGAINST EX-COP UPGRADED TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf deplored the violence against the officers. “An assassin cowardly shot two federal protective contractors as they stood watch over a protest,” Wolf said on Saturday.

According to our Partners in News at ABC 21, two of them were from Michigan, and two were from Indiana but not specifically Fort Wayne. A full list of arrests has not yet been released. Protesters clashed again with police on Saturday, with police deploying a large amount of tear gas and making 68 arrests. 63 of them live within an hour of Fort Wayne.

Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. By midnight, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department had confirmed one fatality, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. Commentary: Indianapolis in troubled times: 'Why are you crying? More: Business leaders call for an end to looting IMPD deemed Downtown unsafe and asked residents to stay away from the area, even as fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and, in some cases, banks and other businesses. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice — No Peace."" The Saturday demonstrations followed a tense night Friday in Indianapolis, where crowds of people marched Downtown to protest police shootings, including the killings of Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and, most recently, George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said the protests that started Friday and continued until about 4 a.m. Saturday resulted in 27 arrests and damage to at least 30 business, including a CVS that was looted and sustained fire damage. It's unclear how many arrests were made and businesses damaged Saturday night and into the Sunday morning hours. A peaceful demonstration turns into something else The slow-rolling protest Saturday elicited a mix of cheers and jeers from motorists, bystanders and people watching the action unfold live on social media. Police took a hands off approach until just after sunset, when a confrontation occurred at Market and Alabama streets, where protesters blocked the road in front of a line of squad cars. “This is no longer a lawful assembly. You are subject to arrest,"" an officer told protesters several times over a public address system. Most of the protesters held their position blocking the road. An IndyStar reporter at the scene saw 10 officers and four police cars. Most were wearing gas masks and standing still. One protester threw a water bottle at an officer, and several others followed. Officers then began firing tear gas. Many of the protesters scattered from the area and retreated further back in the streets. At a late night media briefing IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor condemned the violence and said officers had been working very well with the protest organizers earlier in the day. “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests,"" Taylor said in a prepared statement. ""Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings."" He continued: ""Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD."" Officials urged peaceful assembly In the wake of the conflict and violence less than 24 hours earlier, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett issued statements urging those returning Downtown for the two Saturday protests to refrain from violence and vandalism. Hogsett said he also asked organizers to conclude the events by 7 p.m. and encourage participants to leave the Downtown area after that time. It all went according to plan, at least initially. Police said there were no arrests or major issues when the second protest formally ended at 7 p.m. But few in the crowd — a mix of mostly young blacks and whites, many wearing masks — appeared to heed warnings to leave from organizers. Instead the crowd continued to snake through city street north and east of monument circle for nearly two hours before the standoff near the northeast corner of the City-County Building. The feelings of racial injustice fueling the protests extend far beyond Indianapolis and Indiana, said Deziree Walker, a native of Griffith, Indiana, and former IUPUI student who marched with the protesters Saturday. ""Seeing what's been going on for years and years and years, we're tired. We're exhausted,"" she explained. ""We want change. That's why we're here today."" Indy joins cities around the nation The local protests are part of a nationwide eruption of unrest that has drawn throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities, including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Some cities have seen five days of protests. In Indianapolis, Taylor said five IMPD vehicles were damaged and three officers and three civilians were injured Friday night and early Saturday morning, including a person who sustained what Taylor characterized as ""severe lacerations"" while kicking glass. As some protesters grew unruly, police in riot gear launched tear gas canisters and shot pepper balls in an effort to break up the crowd. Just after midnight, police said, someone fired shots at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy outside 1 American Square. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire. No suspect has been arrested. Demonstrators returned Downtown Saturday afternoon for the first of two planned protests. As they gathered at the Indiana Convention Center, city workers and private crews hustled to block off several streets and place sheets of plywood over ground-floor windows. Both events Saturday were publicized on social media by local organizers who urged participants to refrain from violence. At 5;30 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 gathered at the Indiana War Memorial began moving to Monument Circle chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice — No peace"" and ""Hands up — Don't shot."" At the circle, a protester spray-painted BLM, for black lives matter, on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Earlier, about 100 demonstrators began gathering around 1 p.m. at the convention center for an event promoted as a show of solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. It was organized by Indianapolis resident Malik Muhammad. About 50 people from that event moved north to the war memorial for the second protest at 4 p.m. They marched north amid chants of ""What do we want — body cams"" and ""when do we want them — now."" The second protest, which focused on the shooting of Reed, was organized by Indianapolis resident Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student. She called for the release of an autopsy report and the names of officers involved in the May 6 shooting. ""There has been no justice for his case,"" Brown said through a bullhorn. ""And there will never be justice for his case."" The crowd quickly swelled from a few hundred to an estimated 2,000 or more. Brown said the event, which had been set to end at sunset, or 9:05 p.m., would instead end at 7 p.m. Anything that happens after that, Brown said, is not affiliated with her event. She urged the crowd to remain nonviolent, and warned that IMPD had told her that it could use force to clear the streets after 7 p.m. Brown's message echoed statements earlier Saturday from Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Both issued public statements acknowledging the right to demonstrate, but urging participants to remain peaceful and refrain from vandalism or looting. Hogsett said he met Saturday morning to discuss the protests with representatives of Indy10 Black Lives Matter and the mother of Reed, 21, who was shot and killed by IMPD officers earlier this month after a police chase he recorded on Facebook Live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say he fired a weapon. As he ran, the officer first attempted to tase him, then shot. The shooting is under investigated. The mayor said he made commitments to ""continued change"" in the areas of community policing, transparency and police accountability, including implementing body cameras and a new use-of-force review board. ""We must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless,"" he said. Hogsett added he hoped demonstrations would conclude by 7 p.m. The mayor said he asked the organizers to instruct demonstrators to return to their homes at that time. ""I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,"" he said. ""But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love."" The Mayor took to Twitter at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to condemn the violence. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" Hogsett's social media post said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" The Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement calling for an end to the violence. ""The opportunity to succeed is central to the growth of Indianapolis, and significant barriers including systemic racism threaten this opportunity,"" said CEO Michael Huber. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change. When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury.""

Sixth St. Leshae, a 2006 Lafayette Jeff grad, said she was moved and angered, as much of the nation was, by the death the of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died last week after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, held him down with a knee into his neck as a bystander recorded video. Chauvin was fired and later arrested for murder.

Also powering the national protests are the deaths of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police in March, and Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot three times as he jogged by a white father and son who pursued him in a pickup truck. Protesters in Indianapolis Friday and Saturday said they are also protesting the police-involved shooting death of 21-year-old Dreasjon Reed on May 6. Reed was fatally shot by an IMPD officer following a pursuit on the city's north side. Part of the pursuit and the shooting were streamed live on Facebook. After two nights of protests that devolved into police firing tear gas and people breaking windows, setting fires and looting downtown businesses, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett imposed an 8 p.m. curfew for Sunday night in an attempt to rein in the destruction.

Leshae said she was in touch with Lafayette police as the rally came together and said that the point of the march “isn’t to be against the police.” Police brutality, though, she said, was a different question. “I love my city, and I love my home,” Leshae said. “I believe we all do. … I also believe we need to stand together to say that what we’re seeing won’t do. We have to do better. And we have to start working for that now.” More: Faith leaders gather a virtual rally after KKK flyers found near Lafayette, even as Klan promises more Meanwhile, Lafayette Mayor Tony Roswarski – a former Lafayette police officer – issued a statement on Saturday, condemning what Chauvin did and calling discussions about race and community policing. Here’s his full statement: “The recent death of George Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department is a terrible tragedy. The inexcusable act that caused the death of Mr. Floyd is wrong and heartbreaking; there is simply no other way to put it. It is a devastating reminder of the work that still needs to be done when it comes to the issues of race and law enforcement training, and the need for a national dialogue on institutional racism. As a former law enforcement officer, I cannot understand what could have possibly led to this tragic outcome for Mr. Floyd. I implore people of this community and nationwide to use this devastating situation to start a meaningful dialogue that will create tangible change and the opportunity for everyone to live a life of inclusion, free of racism and discrimination. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to all of those who have been affected by this incident and others.” Contributing: Indianapolis Star.

Protesters gathered in Brooklyn on Saturday, just as they did in Harlem, Chicago, Los Angeles and 30 other cities across the country, to demand justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody on May 25. Protesters and police clashed, turning the peaceful protest into a violent riot that saw police cars burned and stores looted. LAWYER FOR GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY WANTS CHARGES AGAINST EX-COP UPGRADED TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER However, footage of protest organizers defending a Target store spread across social media, with many believing it would “not be reported” for not fitting with the riot narrative. In the footage, originally posted by Forbes reporter Andrew Solender, a group of protesters stood in front of the store entrance, telling others to “back up” and “go away.” Independent Twitter user “Jazz” interviewed one of the protesters in the video, with both having to run while they spoke to stay ahead of the pursuing force of police officers. The protester alleges that it was not actually protesters, but bad actors – in this case, he accuses the police themselves – who attempted to instigate the trouble. “The individuals who wanted to break in entry to the Target in the first place were undercover detectives hired by the NYPD – they made it seem like they were part of the group with everyone else, but I was there, front line,” the unnamed protester claimed. “We are simply doing a peaceful protest. They’re trying to set us up,” he added. “That is not the narrative we are painting for our generation.” Over the previous week, protests regularly turned violent, with many saying that looting and rioting is diminishing the message that protesters are trying to send. Leaders across the country, both elected and otherwise, have publicly condemned the rioting, saying that such violence is no longer about the death of Floyd. PROTESTS SPARKED BY GEORGE FLOYD’S DEATH GET SUPPORT FROM AROUND THE WORLD Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the riots, saying that they no longer have anything to do with George Floyd’s death. “This is no longer about protesting,” Frey said. “This is about violence and we need to make sure that it stops.” Both leaders have implied that organized outsiders, including but not limited to anarchists, white supremacists, and gangs from other states, were behind the destruction and chaos in Minneapolis.

No details about the shootings were immediately released, but the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said no officers were involved. “There were several people down here who had no intention to protest. Their intention was to riot,"" deputy police chief Joshua Barker said. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. The Indianapolis Star reported at least six people were arrested after protesters made their way into the City County Building. Police said those arrests occurred shortly before officers deployed gas canisters in the area. Barker said one officer had minor injuries. Fire officials also confirmed a small fire occurred at a bank building, but the Star reported that some protesters tried to extinguish the flames. Much like Friday, Saturday's demonstration began peacefully but turned violent as the sun began to set. Police Chief Randal Taylor said that on Friday, at least 30 businesses were damaged and 27 people were arrested during demonstrations that continued through at least 4 a.m. The violence in Indianapolis and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd's death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement earlier Saturday that he, like many people, “was horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd,” but urged protesters to refrain from violence. “I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,” Hogsett said. “But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love.”",0.0

A rare citywide curfew expired as dawn revealed broken shop windows, demolished security gates and graffiti along entire blocks. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Saturday he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. Garcetti said the Guard members who arrived early Sunday were summoned “to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city.” Firefighters responded to dozens of fires, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was the area around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the area, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. One officer suffered a fractured skull, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said. When the curfew took effect at 8 p.m., police moved aggressively to get people off the streets and there was no repeat of the late-night rampage that occurred downtown Friday night and led to more than 500 arrests. Community leaders denounced the violence that has accompanied protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who was died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two banks next door to each other burned to the ground and windows and people smashed windows at many businesses including a real estate office and a popular bar. San Diego police officers, aided by other law enforcement agencies, walked shoulder to shoulder through the streets after 2 a.m. Sunday, telling hundreds of protesters and observers that they would be arrested for unlawful assembly if they didn’t disperse. The suburb of 60,000 people borders El Cajon, where the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a police officer triggered days of major unrest in 2016. “I think people are hurting and they’re angry and they’re trying to be heard because there’s no other way to get anyone’s attention,” Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa, near San Diego. “It’s unfortunate but this has been part of our history and how things get done because they don’t listen any other way.” Kaiahua, who is white, said she was exposed to tear gas in a police attempt to disperse crowds. San Francisco’s iconic Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria’s Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said a citywide curfew would go into effect from 8 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. She also asked the governor to put the National Guard on standby. “People are hurting right now. They’re angry. I’m angry,” Breed tweeted. “We can’t tolerate violence and vandalism.” In nearby Oakland, which was wracked by violence Friday night that left 13 officers injured, authorities declared an unlawful demonstration near City Hall late Saturday. Protesters lit a dumpster on fire in the middle of an intersection and police launched tear gas into a crowd. In Emeryville, just east of San Francisco, Mayor Christian Patz said Target, Best Buy and other box stores were burglarized, with thieves stealing electronics and other items. Stores in the city closed early Saturday as part of a shelter-in-place order. In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, hundreds of demonstrators converged on the police station, throwing objects and setting off firecrackers as police used tear gas to push them back. The scale of the destruction in Los Angeles was being compared to the 1992 riots, when there was more than $1 billion in property damage. There was no estimate of how many businesses suffered damage since protests began Wednesday, but it was clearly extensive. The governor said earlier that authorities were closely monitoring organizing by violent extremist groups who may be trying to use the protests for their own agendas. “To those who seek to exploit Californians’ pain to sow chaos and destruction, you are not welcome,” he said. “Our state and nation must build from this moment united and more resolved than ever to address racism and its root causes.” ------ Associated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Elliot Spagat in La Mesa, California contributed to this report.",0.0

Demonstrators smashed shop windows, threw objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads.

But they have not been surprised. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday – bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred sat in the street and waved placards The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday evening under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Police said the gathering, organized through social media, was larger than expected but reported no arrests. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting “I can't breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia also expressed a lack of shock. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That's a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement – Lebanon revolts – which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ------ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D'Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut and Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ------ Follow the AP's latest news about racial protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

The chaos reached into every corner of the country, and the scars extended even to buildings near the White House. Some elected officials prepared to deploy additional National Guard troops in anticipation of more turmoil. Tens of thousands of people marched peacefully to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. But many demonstrations sank into violence as night fell: Cars and stores were torched. The words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam eras. And by Sunday morning, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to squad cars, threw bottles at officers and broke storefront windows. They carried away TVs and other merchandise even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead after multiple shootings that happened during downtown violence. Those slayings added to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up the demonstrations. The show of force came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis and declaring “No games!” He said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. On Sunday, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump and anti-police sentiments. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. County Commissioner Angela Conley showed up shortly after the curfew lifted, saying that police had trampled flowers and photos of Floyd. “The community needs healing, and what happened last night only exacerbated the pain that’s been felt,” she said of police action. Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who put his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. Meanwhile, a church located at the intersection set up chairs for an outdoor service. Tracy Gordon, of the Worldwide Outreach for Christ, said it was important ""to bring some hope to the community and let everyone know that God is in control.” Few parts of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia , and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets by evening. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” the Republican told television station WSB late Saturday. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there ... to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In Virginia’s capital city, graffiti invoking Floyd or directing slurs at the police dotted downtown, including many of Richmond's prominent Confederate monuments. At the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which news outlets reported was vandalized and set ablaze, a few men with long guns were among a small crowd gathered outside. One man said they were there to protect the building. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, six officers were hurt by thrown rocks and fireworks. Police have arrested nearly 1,700 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. ------ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0
1621748552,2020-05-31 14:30:01,Indianapolis imposes curfew after 2 nights of violence,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/indiana/20200531/indianapolis-imposes-curfew-after-2-nights-of-violence,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"INDIANAPOLIS – The Indianapolis mayor imposed an overnight curfew Sunday after two nights of violent protest over police mistreatment of African Americans that caused widespread damage downtown and included several shootings. Two people died in shootings, though it wasn't clear their deaths were related to the protests. Mayor Joe Hogsett said the 8 p.m. curfew comes after peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after an officer held his knee on his neck for several minutes, has sparked protests nationwide. “It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protesters or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,” Hogsett said. The two people killed in downtown Indianapolis were shot amid several shootings reported late Saturday and early Sunday. Police said no officers fired their guns. Deputy Police Chief Josh Barker said one person was arrested in one of the deaths, but that connections between the gunfire and the protests remained uncertain and under investigation. Police officers used tear gas to break up the crowd after some people broke windows at the City-County Building and one person entered, Barker said. Soon, windows at dozens of buildings were broken and people were entering stores and stealing items. Fire badly damaged a pharmacy and fires burned in several large dumpsters pushed into streets. Police reported 29 arrests of protesters late Saturday until about 4 a.m. Sunday after 27 were arrested the night before. The violence in Indianapolis and many other cities was sparked by anger over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday. Four police officers were fired a day later and one has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Police had been called to the area on a report of a man trying to pass a counterfeit bill at a grocery store. Hogsett said he wasn’t seeking National Guard assistance for Indianapolis as is being done in many other cities around the country. Further protests are expected in the city but Hogsett said the curfew until 6 a.m. Monday was intended to protect residents. “These actions are necessary, but they break my heart,” he said.",0.0
1621748544,2020-05-31 14:40:01,Officials blame differing groups of 'outsiders' for violence,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200531/officials-blame-differing-groups-of-outsiders-for-violence,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"WASHINGTON – As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” ------ Hennessey reported from Minneapolis.

Officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray and other crowd-control devices at various locations. Some businesses sustained damage -- mostly broken windows and graffiti. Though it was difficult to assess the extent and range of injuries, ABC21 has confirmed that one man had an eye surgically removed after he was seriously hurt on Saturday.

The shouts were soaked in anger and anguish: “We’re sick of it!” There was dark talk of “radical agitators.” Violent outbursts and arrests piled up across the republic. The White House issued martial statements about law and order. On TV, footage of unrest and anger played on a continuous loop. The voice from mission control was cool and calm as the rocket soared into the sky and towards space. “Stage One propulsion is nominal.” It was the late 1960s. It is right now. For Americans of a certain age — and for those mindful of the past — it is impossible to ignore the similarities between these past few days and some of the more unsettling moments from the 1960s. In particular 1968, a year marred by assassinations and violent social unrest. And there are reasons to believe that 2020, not yet half done, may even surpass 1968 as one of American history’s most powerful social and political flashpoints. From an impeachment trial to a devastating pandemic, from galloping unemployment to George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, all the threads are there, flowing together into a raging, muddied river that serves up unimaginable challenges. “All these things are being woven together,” says historian Thurston Clarke, author of “The Last Campaign,” which chronicles Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign and assassination on June 6 of that year. “It’s like an anti-hit parade, a convergence of the greatest catastrophes of the past 100 years or so, all hitting us at once,” Clarke says. “And with what hope?” In the morass that is 2020, history’s ghosts from an assortment of American eras have resurfaced: — From 1918, when a pandemic’s first wave ravaged, ebbed and then gave way to a more powerful second wave. — From 1930, when an economic crash revealed its longer-term effects on American citizens in the form of the Great Depression. — From 1974, and the governmental disarray that preceded Richard M. Nixon’s resignation, echoed in January and February with the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. — From 1992, and its images of Los Angeles burning after the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King. Perhaps the most uncomfortable era to summon for comparison is the one no one really wants to talk about: 1860, when the final pieces of polarization fell into place for what would be a cataclysmic Civil War. Slavery, America’s greatest historical shame, was the flashpoint then. Today, it is police brutality against black people, a descendant of that awful legacy. Then, as now, there was deep economic disparity, and a debate between individual rights and the common good. Different visions of American life. Different sets of facts and ever-hazier notions of truth. “What’s fundamentally common for all of these things in our history is a lack of agreement of what reality is — a lack of agreement about facts, about causes,” says U.S. historian John Baick of Western New England University. “When we can’t agree on basic truth, we reach our greatest periods of divide.” Now, we also must navigate a social media landscape overloaded with instantly uploaded imagery to persuade and provoke — an echo chamber full of lighter fluid that itself is a subject of national contention, thanks in part to the president. Problems sometimes addressed, sometimes ignored, never truly solved. That’s what makes the deepest impression on Frederick Gooding Jr., who teaches about race. He sees parallels between today and the Reconstruction period that immediately followed the Civil War, when African Americans — coming off a war that, on paper, rebooted American society for them — were confronted with the realities of life in the postwar United States. “You had the premise that `I’m free, but I walk the streets in psychological terror,’” says Gooding, an associate professor of African American studies at Texas Christian University. “There really is nothing new under the sun here about the fundamental structure of our society and the way it behaves,” Gooding says. “The cycle is starting to repeat. There’s outrage, it flares up, there’s new understanding, things are put in place, and then it rears its head again.” But right here, right now, 1968 seems the most relevant touchpoint of all. Then, it was politics and economics and race — the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in particular — with the backdrop of the Vietnam War, a long-running national cataclysm that was killing many thousands of Americans. Now, it is politics and economics and race — the death of George Floyd in particular — with the backdrop of the pandemic, a long-running national cataclysm that is killing many thousands of Americans. There are key differences, of course. The power structures have evolved and to some extent are more inclusive, though nowhere near where many hoped they’d be. One example: Chicago, where in 1968 Mayor Richard J. Daley decried the protests at the Democratic National Convention and pushed the aggressive policing that helped make that a national flashpoint. Today, the mayor is Lori Lightfoot, an African American woman and first openly gay person to hold the office. Perhaps the most striking difference is the one that may be fueling the fires of anger across the land: Now, unlike any other moment in history, protesters in one place can, with a device in their pockets, see and hear what’s happening elsewhere and match or surpass it in real time. Some questions, then: Is this period — what one Minneapolis resident called “a volcano finally erupting after years of simmering” — a singular moment in American life? It’s hard to declare that from within, but it certainly has most of the convulsive themes that have driven and riven U.S. history since its beginnings. Will people gathering and colliding in the most aggressive of fashions — shouting in each other’s faces in the era of the coronavirus — create repercussions we can’t even consider? “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,” protester Rosa Jimenez Cano said in Miami. On Saturday afternoon, the SpaceX rocket streaked into the sky from Cape Canaveral, summoning an American moment of pride, control and expert accomplishment. And like those Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it left a troubled planet behind. “Congratulations to the Astronauts that left Earth today,” actor and comedian Andy Milonakis tweeted. “Good choice.” Below it, all else felt tumultuous, a word that has been used so often to describe 1968 that it has become a cliche. Nevertheless, the word fits 2020, too — like a well-constructed face mask. “For a surprisingly large number of Americans, I think, 1968 marked the end of hope,” Charles Kaiser wrote in “1968 in America,” his 1988 book. “Twenty years later, it may now be possible to start unraveling the mystery of how its traumas and its culture changed us.” Is that how long it will take this time? Will 20 years be enough? And, as with Apollo 11 in 1969, might there be small steps and giant leaps just ahead – breakthroughs in figuring this all out – that help Americans find new ways to soar again? ___ Ted Anthony, director of digital innovation for The Associated Press, has been writing about American culture since 1990.

Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson spoke with demonstrators who were met by police officers in riot gear, local affiliate WEYI reported. ""The only reason we're here is to make sure that you got a voice -- that's it,"" Swanson said in video clips shown on Twitter. ""These cops love you -- that cop over there hugs people,"" he said, pointing to an officer. He was speaking to the crowd protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

""This is the correct response from police #WalkWithUs,"" Gwen Campbell tweeted. JJ Milliken, another Swanson supporter, said via Twitter: ""#WalkWithUs is how we change a system that murdered #GeorgeFloyd. It requires mindfulness of our actions and beliefs. Chris Swanson exemplifies the deputies and officers I know and respect. Community-first mentality and lead by example. This is a mindful action. This is change."" CNN is attempting to reach the Genesee County Sheriff's office for comment. On Friday Swanson addressed George Floyd's death via a Facebook post. ""I join with the chorus of citizens and law enforcement officials alike, calling for the swift arrest and prosecution of each police officer involved in this appalling crime,"" he wrote.

Saturday's event took place outside the Delaware County Building, at Main and Washington streets. On Sunday, protesters — again responding to the Memorial Day death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd while in police custody — were outside City Hall, along North High Street. Floyd was black, and the now-fired Minneapolis police officer charged with causing his death is white. Sunday's protest — which again featured those assembled chanting, in unison, phrases tied to what in the past week has become a nationwide movement — was organized by a local teenager, Destiny Donati. The 17-year-old Donati said she and a friend posted an invitation to the rally — which began at 2:30 p.m. — on Snapchat, and it was shared elsewhere on social media. The result was a crowd that appeared to exceed 150 people outside City Hall. EARLIER COVERAGE: ►Floyd protest movement reaches downtown Muncie ""I'm actually in awe of how many people came,"" Donati said. ""It actually shows we are all together as a community, standing against violence against the African American community and just people."" At Sunday's event, public officials were given the opportunity to offer comments to those assembled. State Rep. Sue Errington of Muncie said Floyd's death had served as a ""wake-up call"" for the nation. ""I stand with you,"" Errington told the protesters. ""I say enough is enough. ... Black lives matter."" Ray Dudley, a retired Delaware County sheriff's deputy and former sheriff, also spoke. ""We definitely have to change as a community and a nation,"" Dudley, now a member of Muncie City Council, said. ""It takes all of us to make something happen."" Council members Jeff Robinson and Ralph Smith also addressed the crowd. Jeannine Lee Lake, Democratic candidate for the U.S. House seat representing District 6, discussed her concerns while raising African American children in a society where some people continue to be treated differently because of their race. Lake said she had relatives who work in law enforcement and knows most officers are decent people. ►MEMORIAL DAY SALE: Subscribe to The Star Press online for $1 for 3 months As for bad officers, she said, they should ""get the hell out, and leave us alone."" While protests elsewhere have resulted in conflict between protesters and local police, Saturday's rally in Muncie was without such contention. At Sunday's event, Police Chief Nathan Sloan was given the opportunity to address protesters. ""What happened up north (in Minneapolis) is not the way we do business here,"" he said. The police chief, Deputy Chief Melissa Pease and at least two other city officers on hand exchanged greetings with those gathered. Sunday's event appeared to draw an on-average younger group of people than did the Saturday rally outside the Delaware County Building. Douglas Walker is a news reporter at The Star Press.

1621774144,2020-05-31 14:30:00,Indianapolis imposes curfew after 2 nights of violence,https://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2020/05/news-ap-indianapolis-imposes-curfew-after-2-nights-of-violence,en,True,,660448,Ball State Daily News,http://www.bsudailynews.com/,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis mayor imposed an overnight curfew Sunday after two nights of violent protest over police mistreatment of African Americans that caused widespread damage downtown and included several shootings. Two people died in shootings, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. Mayor Joe Hogsett said the 8 p.m. curfew comes after peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after an officer held his knee on his neck for several minutes, has sparked protests nationwide. “It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protesters or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,” Hogsett said. The two people killed in downtown Indianapolis were shot amid several shootings reported late Saturday and early Sunday. Police said no officers fired their guns. Deputy Police Chief Josh Barker said one person was arrested in one of the deaths, but that connections between the gunfire and the protests remained uncertain and under investigation. Police officers used tear gas to break up the crowd after some people broke windows at the City-County Building and one person entered, Barker said. Soon, windows at dozens of buildings were broken and people were entering stores and stealing items. Fire badly damaged a pharmacy and fires burned in several large dumpsters pushed into streets. Police reported 29 arrests of protesters late Saturday until about 4 a.m. Sunday after 27 were arrested the night before. The violence in Indianapolis and many other cities was sparked by anger over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday. Four police officers were fired a day later and one has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Police had been called to the area on a report of a man trying to pass a counterfeit bill at a grocery store. Hogsett said he wasn’t seeking National Guard assistance for Indianapolis as is being done in many other cities around the country. Further protests are expected in the city but Hogsett said the curfew until 6 a.m. Monday was intended to protect residents. “These actions are necessary, but they break my heart,” he said.",0.0

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that the United States will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization, even though the US government has no existing legal authority to label a wholly domestic group in the manner it currently designates foreign terrorist organizations. The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020 Current and former government officials say it would be unconstitutional for the US government to proscribe First Amendment-protected activity inside the US based on simple ideology. US law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn’t enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get out their messages. An additional problem with the President’s claim is that groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don’t have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for US law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. The President’s call for a terrorist designation comes as Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr have pointed to far-left groups as responsible for many of the violent protests across the country. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations. An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though US law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. Trump’s and Barr’s focus on left-leaning groups also stands in contrast with repeated warnings in recent years from US law enforcement that the rise of white supremacist groups has become the biggest domestic terrorism challenge. Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has raised concerns about the increase of white supremacist activity driving the domestic terror threat — in some cases surpassing that from foreign terrorist groups. In response to the President’s tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is “no legal authority for designating a domestic group” as a terrorist organization. “As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.” The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort. Despite threats by the President to designate various groups as terrorists, the closest the Trump administration has come is, in recent weeks, the State Department’s designation of a white supremacist group called Russian Imperial Movement, which is a foreign group but has some domestic US supporters, as a specially designated global terrorist group. What is Antifa? Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn’t have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the “radical ideals” promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. “They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.” The majority of Antifa members don’t fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters. How did the group start? The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism atCalifornia State University, San Bernardino. “What they’re trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,” Levin said. Where do they protest? Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country. In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer. Earlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the “Black Bloc.” They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting. Why are they controversial? The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held. Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence. “There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,” Crow said. Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because “they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.” “There’s this ‘It’s going down’ mentality and this ‘Hit them with your boots’ mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,” he added. White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the “alt-left.” Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent. Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalistwho attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are “just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.” “These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don’t see right-wing protests get like this,” Cvjetanovic told CNN affiliate KRNV. But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. “The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that. “And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don’t believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.”",0.0

The mayor made the announcement during a press conference with IMPD Chief Randal Taylor regarding the past two nights of protesting in the city. During the news conference, Hogsett said the curfew will be enforced by the authorities, with exceptions made for those traveling to and from work, seeking medical care, or fleeing from dangerous circumstances; law enforcement; members of the news media; federal, state, or local public officials conducting necessary work; and individuals experiencing homelessness. The curfew is in response to the violence that erupted in the city Saturday night after peaceful protests during the daytime. “Rocks and other projectiles were thrown, businesses were vandalized and looted, government buildings were targeted, fires were repeatedly set with the intention of doing harm,” said Hogsett. “Guns were pulled and deadly violence was directed with wanton disregard for other civilians. “It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protestors or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,” he said. “That is why this morning I will sign an executive order instituting a countywide curfew and red travel orders that will take effect at 8 p.m this evening and last through 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. Under this order all residents are required to be home by 8 p.m. and to stay home for their own safety.” The Indiana Department of Transportation announced the following Interstate ramps into downtown Indianapolis will be closed: I-70 WB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 SB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 NB to Washington St I-65 NB/SB to MLK Additionally, Gov. Eric Holcomb announced that he had directed the Indiana National Guard to coordinate with the Indiana State Police in securing state properties in downtown Indianapolis. Some graffiti was sprayed on the pedestals of statues facing east from the Statehouse. The Indiana Soldiers & Sailors Monument, the site of several rallies recently, was also tagged with the names of persons who recently died in police action shootings both in Indiana and nationally. Saturday’s rally was attended by more than a thousand people who marched peacefully from the Indiana War Memorial to the Circle in a call for an end to perceived racial injustice at the hands of law enforcement and concluded before 7 p.m. per an agreement with the mayor’s office. IMPD reported that 29 people were arrested overnight. Two people were killed in shootings overnight as well, one of which happened near the intersection of North Pennsylvania and East Market Street and the other in the 3700 block of Orchard Avenue, on Indy’s near northeast side. Earlier in the evening, IMPD officers in dressed in tactical gear responded to Market Street outside the City-County Building after a protester broke a first-floor window. “We observed individuals loading rocks and other objects into backpacks. There were individuals who were carrying shields and other implements to protect themselves from any law enforcement tactics we may have to employ,” said IMPD Deputy Chief Josh Barker. “We observed an unsettling number of individuals armed with various types of long guns, shotguns, handguns and the like.” CBS4 watched as protest organizers attempted to regain control of the demonstration after the window was broken, moving the crowd away from the front of the CCB, pointing to the east and the nearby Whole Foods at Market and Alabama Streets. The mood of crowd changed and became more confrontational as Barker said rocks, frozen water bottles and other projectiles were launched at police. “Our intention in the very beginning was to create a buffer or an area of deniability, if you will, to get those rioters back away from the building to prevent additional damage to the City-County Building and keep them from entering that building with an overwhelming number,” said Barker, recounting how his police move toward the crowd. “They immediately started getting rocks thrown at the officers. Rioters in the crowd had firecrackers and other incendiary type devices that they were lighting on fire and throwing at our officers. They then began to damage some of the police vehicles that had pulled up in the periphery. “It was not until that point several hours into this successful protest that IMPD initially used pepper ball and chemical agents to begin to disperse that crowd that had gathered in front of the City-County Building.” CBS4 observed several protesters placed under arrest outside the Whole Foods store and spotted tear gas clouds rising in the vicinity of 251 East Ohio Street near the offices of the Marion County Prosecutor where first floor windows were broken. IMPD Chief Randy Taylor was asked if groups like Antifa, which President Trump said he would designate as a terrorist group, were involved in the organizing the riots. “Obviously I know that there were people in the crowds that were not from the Indianapolis area,” said Taylor. “I don’t know if that particular group was involved. I wouldn’t be surprised if that was confirmed but we do know that there were people here specifically to cause chaos and trouble.” “In the chaos that ensued, significant damage was done to our downtown. Once more we awake to a morning defined by unproductive destruction.” The mayor’s office stated that violation of the curfew order is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and fines worth up to $10,000. “This policy is not intended to punish our residents – it is intended to protect them,” said Hogsett. “We also remain committed to protecting the peaceful demonstrations we fully expect will take place today and in the weeks to come. We do not tolerate these acts of protest – we celebrate them. And just as with yesterday, we will continue to work with event organizers to ensure they have a venue to deliver their non-violent message without interference.”",0.0

Rioters in Seattle reportedly had stolen two loaded AR-15s out of a smashed Seattle Police Department cruiser lit on fire earlier in the evening.

The second man, wearing a hoodie and a blue bandana over his face to conceal his identity, could be seen on live broadcast footage carrying an AR-15 before the security guard entered the frame, who pointed his own gun at the man and snatched the rifle. On Sunday morning, Kruse tweeted a numbered sequence of the events that unfolded at the scene to provide clarification as to what happened. She said Seattle Police “needs to answer for why these weapons were left in police cars in the middle of the riot zone.” “As I explained on air, our security guard felt that the public was in danger. He took the AR 15 from the rioter and disabled it. We called 911 and waited to hand it over and continue our reporting. Protesters surrounded us, calling us police,” Kruse tweeted. In an earlier tweet, she wrote: “We have video of them firing one of them and were there when it happened. Witnessed it all. They shouted for people to ‘clear the block’ then fired and everyone ran.” She also recounted that at one point during the incident, protesters started to surround her and the news crew, and began accusing them of being members of law enforcement. “There was a moment after the AR-15 ordeal where a group of rioters surrounded me, screaming that I was a cop. One threatened my life. I am IMMENSELY grateful to a BLM protester who physically put herself between me and the rioters and told them to back off. Thank you, truly,” Kruse wrote. By Sunday morning, the reporter also shared several images showing volunteers take to the streets of Seattle to scrub graffiti off of buildings and repair other damage done by the rioters. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said 27 people were arrested Saturday night and faced charges ranging from assault, arson, property destruction and looting. She said officers and civilians suffered injuries, as rioters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails.

As these groups refused to listen to commands or stop their destruction, SPD officers then had to deploy crowd control measures to end the lawlessness as assaults on officers and property continued. At no time have officers discharged their firearms. There were countless uses of non-lethal and crowd control tools,” she said. Some 200 National Guard members also helped control the scene. The Seattle metropolitan area will extend its curfew for a second night to help maintain and restore the peace, KOMO reported.",0.0

Hogsett said the curfew from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday came after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction. The violent protests, coinciding with others nationwide that saw similar levels of unrest, sparked widespread damage downtown and included several shootings. Two people died in shootings, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. “It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protesters or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,” Hogsett said. AT LEAST 60 SECRET SERVICE MEMBERS INJURED DURING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS IN DC The two people killed in downtown Indianapolis were shot amid several shootings reported late Saturday and early Sunday. Police said no officers fired their guns. Deputy Police Chief Josh Barker said one person was arrested in one of the deaths, but connections between the gunfire and the protests remained uncertain and under investigation.

Watch Live: Indiana faith leaders are holding a demonstration for racial justice downtown. Posted by WISH-TV on Sunday, May 31, 2020 Indianapolis Urban league released a statement on the recent riots and protests in the city of Indianapolis. “Many are familiar with a famous observation by Martin Luther King, Jr., “…a riot is the language of the unheard.” What people seldom remember is his observation afterward that is just as salient and relevant today, “And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.” This quote, from Dr. Kings’ 1967 “The Other America” speech given at Stanford University, crystallizes what lies at the heart of the frustrations that have been aired both verbally and physically this past weekend in Indianapolis and across our nation. Inequality is a reality Indianapolis. Inequality of employment, housing, education, health care and justice go unheard from generation to generation. What we are experiencing in our city, and cities across our country, is the language of pain when people’s spirits are broken and they move beyond hopelessness to outrage. We shudder at the display of violence and the visible outcome of the broken glass and desecration of monuments, sidewalks and things deemed valuable by, and to, our community, yet for decades leaders have been willing to look past the visible scars of destruction and disparity of social injustice passed from generation to generation of people of color. The scars of repeated history are the persistent victimization of Blacks from Eric Garner, to Sandra Bland, to Ahmed Aubrey, to Breonna Taylor, to George Floyd, and from Michael Taylor to Aaron Bailey to Dreasjon Reed; only the names change but the outcomes remain the same. Black men and Black women die at the hands of law enforcement and rarely are the officers charged, prosecuted, and convicted for their crimes even though we witness them in real time. Peaceful protests are a constitutional right and must be permitted to continue. However, those who are rioting, damaging property, and looting should be held accountable and so must our city hold officers of the law to the same level of accountability for its actions. Now that this happened in our city, it will continue to happen unless things change. The trauma of history a third of our community experiences daily from Black unemployment rates that triple that of Whites, to a lack of affordable housing, to under-resourced and under-performing schools,to persistent and growing health disparities, to a lack of investment in communities of color that breed and feed both the perception and reality of second-class citizenship for Blacks in Marion County. If you are born poor in Indianapolis, you are likely to die poor in Indianapolis. Indianapolis ranks near the bottom in social mobility. Marion County has the fourth highest rate of poverty in the state of Indiana at 19.8% but the poverty rate for Blacks is 28%. Since 2000, the home ownership rate for Black households in Marion County has sharply declined to less than 40%. Black neighborhoods are being gentrified and Blacks are being displaced. Discussions around equity, economic inclusion, livable wages, affordable housing, school improvement and police reform must move from talk to commitments accompanied by long-term financial investments from the city, the state, corporations and philanthropies towards sustainable solutions. Social justice is not just a concept, it is a commitment to creating a fair and equal society in which each individual matters, their rights are recognized and protected and decisions are made in ways that are fair an honest. Those we seek to help must be included in the process and their voices must be heard. These problems of inequality not only exist in Indianapolis but they are pervasive throughout our state. They are not just problems for Blacks and Latinos living in urban communities, these are the same problems being experienced by poor Whites living in both urban and rural communities. The diversity of the protesters and the diversity of those who struggle to survive throughout our community and across our state should be notable to all. While the COVID-19 virus prevents us from physically embracing at this time, it is more important than ever that we join together in understanding the impacts of the contagions of discrimination, racism, and inequality.

Video captured by Fox 29 showed what appeared to a hijacked police car crashed into another vehicle. Other protesters could be seen ransacking another police car, smashing its windshield and emptying its contents out onto the street. The lingering unrest prompted city officials to order retail businesses closed and issue a curfew from 6 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. President Trump demanded that officials call upon the National Guard to quell the unrest like was done in Minneapolis. “Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems!” Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon. The Minnesota National Guard had told reporters that the request for its activation came from the state’s governor, Tim Walz.

US Police officers have been detained in connection with the death of George Floyd that has led to protests in many countries and across the U.S.(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) LONDON (AP) — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most murderous police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas.

He said he felt like cleaning up was the best way for him to contribute because he did not want to let the actions of a few people take away from the message many protestors wanted to send. I think when we focus on this aspect, like the graffiti and the damage, the actual protest gets overshadowed and what the message is with that,” he said. Amanda White was also out cleaning.

The Fort Wayne Police Department said Sunday that after violent and destructive protests both Friday and Saturday, 99 people were arrested (29 on Friday and 70 on Saturday, including two juveniles). After two officers and “a few citizens” were injured Friday, the department said one officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries during Saturday’s protest, and an untold number of protesters were hurt, inducing one seriously. Saturday’s protest stretched from early afternoon to early morning Sunday, police said. Fort Wayne Police issued the following statement about Saturday’s protest: Today’s protest occurred just outside the Allen County Court House. The protest started at 2pm this afternoon. Initially the protest was peaceful and orderly. Just after 5pm the protest began to become more and more disorderly. A few people began entering the street walking up and down Clinton in front of the courthouse; some were banging on passing cars. At times more and more people entered the street. At one point the crowd rushed the streets creating a difficulty with traffic flow. At one point Clinton was down to one lane. 10 Point Coalition was able to help move some cars but then became overwhelmed with the crowds. A truck in the street was swarmed and the crowd began surrounding it. Several people appeared to be banging on it and it created a panic moment with the driver speeding off almost hitting people. At that point Fort Wayne Police went into the street. They started to give orders to disperse and were met with projectiles from the crowd. The crowd refused to disperse. The officers then began to introduce gas to the area. The crowd began to dispersed. The crowd then made its way to the Martin Luther King Bridge where they staged a sit in and some people began climbing to the top of the bridge. Officers allowed the protesters this area to protest. They then left that area went east on Fourth St and came back up Spy Run. They made their way to Berry St where they confronted County Officers and began assaulting them with rocks, bottles and other projectiles. At this point officers were deployed strategically to areas and began using tear gas to disperse the crowds. Several hot spots were targeted and the crowds dissipated greatly with those efforts. There was one officer hurt last evening and he was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. There were reports of injuries to protestors one was serious but non-life-threatening. He was transported to a local hospital. There were over 60 arrests made by all officers yesterday. Most of them were for Disorderly Conduct, Failure to Leave an Emergency Area and Rioting.

After protests Friday night and Saturday night went from peaceful to destructive, with police shooting tear gas at activists and nearly 100 people arrested, Sunday’s event was largely peaceful. Protesters returned to the sidewalk in front of the Allen County Courthouse along Clinton Street around 2 p.m. By 4:30, around 200 protesters were on the block. Many held signs with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “Respect Existence or Expect Resistance.” Another sign read “If You Don’t Charge Killer Cops More Cops Will Kill.” Later, protesters laid down on the courthouse lawn and chanted, “I can’t breathe,” the phrase George Floyd uttered as a Minneapolis Police officer knelt on his neck while in custody. Protesters then laid face down in a show of solidarity against police brutality. Protesters gather on the lawn of the Allen County Courthouse on Sunday, May 31, 2020.

Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. By midnight, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department had confirmed one fatality, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. Commentary: Indianapolis in troubled times: 'Why are you crying? More: Business leaders call for an end to looting IMPD deemed Downtown unsafe and asked residents to stay away from the area, even as fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and, in some cases, banks and other businesses. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice — No Peace."" The Saturday demonstrations followed a tense night Friday in Indianapolis, where crowds of people marched Downtown to protest police shootings, including the killings of Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and, most recently, George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said the protests that started Friday and continued until about 4 a.m. Saturday resulted in 27 arrests and damage to at least 30 business, including a CVS that was looted and sustained fire damage. It's unclear how many arrests were made and businesses damaged Saturday night and into the Sunday morning hours. A peaceful demonstration turns into something else The slow-rolling protest Saturday elicited a mix of cheers and jeers from motorists, bystanders and people watching the action unfold live on social media. Police took a hands off approach until just after sunset, when a confrontation occurred at Market and Alabama streets, where protesters blocked the road in front of a line of squad cars. “This is no longer a lawful assembly. You are subject to arrest,"" an officer told protesters several times over a public address system. Most of the protesters held their position blocking the road. An IndyStar reporter at the scene saw 10 officers and four police cars. Most were wearing gas masks and standing still. One protester threw a water bottle at an officer, and several others followed. Officers then began firing tear gas. Many of the protesters scattered from the area and retreated further back in the streets. At a late night media briefing IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor condemned the violence and said officers had been working very well with the protest organizers earlier in the day. “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests,"" Taylor said in a prepared statement. ""Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings."" He continued: ""Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD."" Officials urged peaceful assembly In the wake of the conflict and violence less than 24 hours earlier, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett issued statements urging those returning Downtown for the two Saturday protests to refrain from violence and vandalism. Hogsett said he also asked organizers to conclude the events by 7 p.m. and encourage participants to leave the Downtown area after that time. It all went according to plan, at least initially. Police said there were no arrests or major issues when the second protest formally ended at 7 p.m. But few in the crowd — a mix of mostly young blacks and whites, many wearing masks — appeared to heed warnings to leave from organizers. Instead the crowd continued to snake through city street north and east of monument circle for nearly two hours before the standoff near the northeast corner of the City-County Building. The feelings of racial injustice fueling the protests extend far beyond Indianapolis and Indiana, said Deziree Walker, a native of Griffith, Indiana, and former IUPUI student who marched with the protesters Saturday. ""Seeing what's been going on for years and years and years, we're tired. We're exhausted,"" she explained. ""We want change. That's why we're here today."" Indy joins cities around the nation The local protests are part of a nationwide eruption of unrest that has drawn throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities, including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Some cities have seen five days of protests. In Indianapolis, Taylor said five IMPD vehicles were damaged and three officers and three civilians were injured Friday night and early Saturday morning, including a person who sustained what Taylor characterized as ""severe lacerations"" while kicking glass. As some protesters grew unruly, police in riot gear launched tear gas canisters and shot pepper balls in an effort to break up the crowd. Just after midnight, police said, someone fired shots at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy outside 1 American Square. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire. No suspect has been arrested. Demonstrators returned Downtown Saturday afternoon for the first of two planned protests. As they gathered at the Indiana Convention Center, city workers and private crews hustled to block off several streets and place sheets of plywood over ground-floor windows. Both events Saturday were publicized on social media by local organizers who urged participants to refrain from violence. At 5;30 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 gathered at the Indiana War Memorial began moving to Monument Circle chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice — No peace"" and ""Hands up — Don't shot."" At the circle, a protester spray-painted BLM, for black lives matter, on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Earlier, about 100 demonstrators began gathering around 1 p.m. at the convention center for an event promoted as a show of solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. It was organized by Indianapolis resident Malik Muhammad. About 50 people from that event moved north to the war memorial for the second protest at 4 p.m. They marched north amid chants of ""What do we want — body cams"" and ""when do we want them — now."" The second protest, which focused on the shooting of Reed, was organized by Indianapolis resident Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student. She called for the release of an autopsy report and the names of officers involved in the May 6 shooting. ""There has been no justice for his case,"" Brown said through a bullhorn. ""And there will never be justice for his case."" The crowd quickly swelled from a few hundred to an estimated 2,000 or more. Brown said the event, which had been set to end at sunset, or 9:05 p.m., would instead end at 7 p.m. Anything that happens after that, Brown said, is not affiliated with her event. She urged the crowd to remain nonviolent, and warned that IMPD had told her that it could use force to clear the streets after 7 p.m. Brown's message echoed statements earlier Saturday from Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Both issued public statements acknowledging the right to demonstrate, but urging participants to remain peaceful and refrain from vandalism or looting. Hogsett said he met Saturday morning to discuss the protests with representatives of Indy10 Black Lives Matter and the mother of Reed, 21, who was shot and killed by IMPD officers earlier this month after a police chase he recorded on Facebook Live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say he fired a weapon. As he ran, the officer first attempted to tase him, then shot. The shooting is under investigated. The mayor said he made commitments to ""continued change"" in the areas of community policing, transparency and police accountability, including implementing body cameras and a new use-of-force review board. ""We must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless,"" he said. Hogsett added he hoped demonstrations would conclude by 7 p.m. The mayor said he asked the organizers to instruct demonstrators to return to their homes at that time. ""I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,"" he said. ""But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love."" The Mayor took to Twitter at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to condemn the violence. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" Hogsett's social media post said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" The Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement calling for an end to the violence. ""The opportunity to succeed is central to the growth of Indianapolis, and significant barriers including systemic racism threaten this opportunity,"" said CEO Michael Huber. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change. When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury.""

1621806751,2020-05-31 19:14:24,Indianapolis protests: Sunday belongs to faith as church leaders bring message of change,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/625714406/0/indystar/allnews~Indianapolis-protests-Sunday-belongs-to-faith-as-church-leaders-bring-message-of-change/,en,False,,85390,blogs.indystar.com,http://blogs.indystar.com/#spider,"“Breonna Taylor.” Thump thump. “George Floyd.” Thump thump. “Deshon Downing.” Thump thump. “Dreasjon Reed.” Thump thump. The names of more than 100 people of color killed by police echoed over the bodies of protesters lying on the ground across from Indianapolis’ City County Building. A drum thumped like a heartbeat between each called name. The death of Floyd while in the custody of officers with the Minneapolis Police Department kicked off protests around the country over the weekend, spurred by other recent and high profile killings of African Americans — including Taylor in Louisville and Reed here in Indianapolis May 6. Downing was killed by officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department during a traffic stop last year. For 8 minutes and 46 seconds on Sunday afternoon, the protesters held a “die in” while Leah Gunning Francis, dean of faculty for the Christian Theological Seminary, read the names of lives cut short and Indianapolis’s faith community sought to send a message to the city’s leaders whose offices they looked up at. “We have seen the unrest and the continued destruction against black bodies across this nation,” said Nicole Barnes, director of operations and voter engagement with Faith in Indiana, which organized the event. “Our message for today is bodies are more important than buildings.” If Friday and Saturday belonged to protesters and police, Sunday morning and afternoon belonged to faith. 'A challenging week' The day started at the pulpit. “Praise God, praise God and welcome to Sunday morning, said Andrew Hunt, pastor at New Life Community Church. ""Dear Heavenly Father, we have had such a challenging week.” The morning after another round of violent protests rocked downtown and left two dead, faith leaders across the city gathered their flocks — some in person and some with pandemic-style virtual sermons — to pray for change. ""Dear God, we pray for our nation, with all of its racial divide, with all of its police brutality, with all its social injustice, with all the lives being circulated,"" said Jeffrey A. Johnson, pastor at Eastern Star Church. ""I pray you will raise us up to transcend these policies and transcend these systems and change these systems to be inclusive of everybody."" Later in the day, faith leaders took that message to the seat of those systems' power to outline how that change should start. Faith in Indiana brought together people of various faiths, ages and races for a march from the Indiana Statehouse, across the city center, to the City County Building. IMPD officers blocked traffic and allowed the march to move peacefully through downtown. While protests in previous days began peacefully but later devolved into unrest and confrontation with officers, Sunday’s event went without incident. LIVE FREE Reform Agenda The group is calling on Mayor Joe Hogsett to adopt and implement a “LIVE FREE Reform Agenda.” The agenda calls on the city to strengthen the police use-of force-policy, enact a progressive discipline policy, de-escalation and procedural justice training, implement group violence intervention recommendations immediately, respond to mental health crises with treatment rather than incarceration, remove unfair protections for officers in law enforcement contracts and require independent investigations of police violence. While organizers said they were hopeful that city leaders would be receptive to their demands, some in the crowd weren't sure. JaShell Bingham said she didn't know how quickly change would happen, but she had to show up because she has people to fight for, people she fears for — like her brother and father, both strong, black men, she said. ""Every little bit counts,"" Bingham said. ""Even if this is just pennies and we need a million dollars."" Bingham said she was heartened by the show of support from such a diverse crowd. Indeed, there were people of all colors and ages — from small children, to the elderly — and not only different denominations of the Christian church, but also followers of Judaism and Islam. They had seemingly nothing in common, except a desire for change — and their faith. Call IndyStar education reporter Arika Herron at 317-201-5620 or email her at Arika.Herron@indystar.com.

The Fort Wayne man instead hoped his family's participation in the afternoon protest would leave his 5-year-old daughter, Sydney, with a memory of standing up for a cause. ""We can't keep losing lives,"" Rothgeb said, his daughter nearby. Sunday marked the third consecutive day protesters in Fort Wayne rallied against police violence and last week's death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. More than 100 people lined the sidewalk along Clinton Street in the demonstration's first hour. They cheered as passing vehicles, including an ambulance, honked their support and as drivers raised fists and gave thumbs-ups through opened windows and sunroofs. They roared – and called out thanks – to drivers who delivered water and snacks. Those gestures of support illustrate that Fort Wayne has a community, protester Tee Cook said. Cook, a black woman with six black sons, attended Friday's and Saturday's protests, which ended with police using tear gas and other measures to disperse the crowds. She stressed that those who prompted police interference did not represent the protesters as a whole. ""The majority of us just want some change,"" Cook said. asloboda@jg.net",0.0

The crowd at the Indiana War Memorial went up the stairs and spilled across the street into nearby University Park at 7 p.m. Two women stood on the hood of a car and yelled the names of black people who have been killed by police. “Justice for Trayvon Martin, justice for Michael Brown, justice for Sean Reed.” A black woman with two young girls in tow pushed through the crowd. “You gotta keep up, you’re not a baby, you’re a big girl now,” she told the smaller of the two. Over 1,000 people attended the march Saturday evening to protest the killing of George Floyd on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer, who’s death sparked protests nationwide. Sean Reed, an Indianapolis man killed by police May 6 and Breonna Taylor, a Kentucky woman killed by police March 13, and others who have been recently killed by police were also on protesters minds. The protest started out peacefully, but escalated sharply around 9 p.m. Protesters broke windows and police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, but the order of events was unclear to our reporters. At 7:30 p.m., protesters began marching. They made loops on blocks east of the war memorial for almost two hours, passing boarded up businesses from the previous night’s looting. People leaned out of windows and over balconies, taking photos and videos. “If you can watch, you can walk,” one woman shouted. Most people who attended were from Indianapolis but some, like Portia Smith from Kentucky, were from out of town. “I’m here to support,” she said. Gygy Oliver, 42, attended the march as a frustrated mother of two black daughters and a black stepson. She brought her 13-year-old daughter Jendayi Oliver. “It’s getting hard, as someone who’s raising their kids right and educated and to be polite and have manners and to do everything right and still feel like it’s not enough,” Oliver said. “That they could still get killed or beat up or harassed by police. It’s getting difficult.” DiQuan Craig, 26, works with students at the Indianapolis Job Corps Center and attended the march in response to recent police brutality events. “We just want to be loved, man, and shown the respect everybody else is getting, that’s all it is,” he said. Nick, a white recent IU graduate, locked arms with other white protesters at the intersection of Delaware Street and Massachusetts Avenue. “I don’t want anyone to get hurt,” he said. “I’m a white body, they’re not going to hit a white body.” Aaron Nell, who does nonviolence training in prisons, ran along the crowd, writing phrases like “Hero’s don’t Kill” in pink chalk on sidewalks and concrete walls. “The killing of people of color and the racist attitudes that are being shared from the high levels all the way down to the average person are leading to people dying,” he said. “And I want to be in solidarity with those who say it has to stop.” Cheryl John, 41, heard about the protest on TV and decided to attend for “justice and peace.” It was her first protest and she said she only was going to support it if it stayed peaceful. It didn’t. Tear gas rolls down the street May 30 in Indianapolis. Police used tear gas to break up the protest, which was in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on May 25. Alex Deryn Tensions began to rise as protesters turned onto East Market Street from North Delaware Street. Protesters banged on the City County Building with their hands and others began getting into shouting matches with drivers trying to pass through the crowd as well as fellow protesters for detracting from the peaceful protest. Protesters continued down East Market Street to where it intersected North Alabama Street, blocking off traffic. Police made their way to the intersection, and suddenly banging sounds were heard and tear gas filled the air. People began running as tear gas canisters were thrown and shot through the air. There is much uncertainty as to who began the conflict with the police. Some protesters say the police shot off the gas first, others say a protester threw something at police which provoked them. Jake, a protester who was within the intersection, later recounted that he did not see anything thrown at police but got tear gas in his eyes twice as police cleared people who were blocking the streets. ""It's not much of an excuse, I would say,"" Jake said. The police continued north on Delaware and Alabama Streets with tear gas, and protesters broke glass in several storefronts on Alabama Street. Protesters with tear gas in their eyes struggled to find the friends they had lost in the run to escape the gas. One person frantically asked around for an inhaler. Many were talking on phones, trying to reconnect with fellow protesters or assure others they were OK. “It’s fucked up down here,” one man said into his phone. “Real fucked up.” ""\""{\\\""blocks\\\"":[{\\\""key\\\"":\\\""9tom3\\\"",\\\""text\\\"":\\\""Protesters gathered May 30 in downtown Indianapolis following George Floyd's death May 25 at the hands of then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\\\"",\\\""type\\\"":\\\""unstyled\\\"",\\\""depth\\\"":0,\\\""inlineStyleRanges\\\"":[],\\\""entityRanges\\\"":[],\\\""data\\\"":[]}],\\\""entityMap\\\"":[]}\"""" Like what you're reading?

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) (CNN) — Law enforcement and federal officials say outside elements from both far-right and far-left groups are helping fuel the violent and damaging confrontations that have marred protests across the country in recent days, despite President Donald Trump’s focus just on Antifa and the far left. Although interference in this way may be happening, federal and local officials have yet to provide evidence to the public. Local and federal officials are still trying to quantify how significant a role the outside groups are playing in the unrest that has spread to cities all over the US. Officials are scrambling to identify the affiliations of the extremists taking part in the riots, property destruction and attacks on police, and allegations of foreign influence stoking the unrest online are being actively tracked. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that ultimately the catalyst of the protests was the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was held down at the neck by white police officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. But the state is looking at data from arrests and human intelligence that points to some outside influence seeking to capitalize on the situation and create unrest. “I certainly think I want to believe it is outside more and that might go to the problem that we have of saying ‘it can’t be Minnesotans’,” Walz said at a Sunday morning press conference. “I know there are outside folks in there whether they are the predominance or whether leading or not.” But the catalyst, he said, was the murder of George Floyd and that was “our problem.” “Saying there are outside forces is not to deflect and pretend we don’t have that,” Walz said. The President and his top officials have blamed far-left extremists for the violence. Trump tweeted Sunday that the United States would designate Antifa, which is short for anti-fascists, as a terrorist organization, and Attorney General William Barr also singled out the group in a statement denouncing the violence as domestic terrorism, announcing federal law enforcement would use its network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces to apprehend and charge those taking part in the violent confrontations. The US government has no existing legal authority to label a wholly domestic group in the manner it currently designates foreign terrorist organizations. Federal law enforcement sees extremists across spectrum While Trump and Barr have focused on Antifa, the FBI and other agencies are tracking groups from both the extremist right and left involved in the riots and attacks on police. Federal law enforcement officials tell CNN they are aware of organized groups who are seeking to carry out the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, anti-government groups often associated with far-right extremists and white supremacy causes, and far-left extremists who identify with anti-fascist ideology. In the past, some of the groups have been known to organize and travel specifically to confront police and destroy property, according to federal law enforcement officials, who say they’ve seen a similar pattern in Minneapolis and other cities where protests have turned violent in recent days. Antifa describes a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get out their messages. The FBI and other federal agencies are working with local authorities to track social media posts and other communications to identify those who have crossed state lines to carry out violence. Federal officials say they believe there is an amalgam of groups showing up in protests from the extremist left and right that normally oppose each other but see common cause in attacking the police and the government. The Trump administration’s message has focused only on the far-left extremists. Barr’s statement referred to violence from “antifa and other similar groups.” On CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, national security adviser Robert O’Brien said, “These Antifa groups are organized and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities.” Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper about far-right groups participating in the violence, O’Brien said: “I haven’t seen the reports on far-right groups. This is being driven by Antifa.” Trump has also blamed Democratic officials in Minnesota and other states where violence has occurred. “Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW,” Trump tweeted Sunday. Acting Senate Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said Saturday that the outsiders included “a rogues gallery of terrorists from Antifa to ‘Boogaloo’ groups encouraging and committing violence.” Boogaloo is a group often associated with far-right extremist ideology that wants to initiate a civil war. Rubio tweeted that the groups were not “ideologically compatible but share a hatred of govt & police & are taking advantage of the protests.” “Many of these professional agitators don’t fit a simple left vs right identity,” Rubio said. “They are part of a growing anti-government extremist movement. They hate law enforcement & want to tear the whole system down even if it requires a new civil war.” What local officials are saying Minnesota officials said this weekend white supremacists and others were mixing in with legitimate protestors. Authorities there are looking at connections between those arrested and white supremacist organizers who have posted online about coming to Minnesota. Officials have also tracked messages about seeking to loot and whether there was a connection to organized crime. At a news conference on Sunday morning, Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said that one-fifth of the weekend arrests to date were from outside the state. Among those arrested Saturday were residents of Arkansas, Kansas City, Iowa, Illinois and Michigan, Harrington said, though he did not have arrest data from overnight. Walz also said the state was looking at who was behind a “very sophisticated” denial of service attack on all state computers that was executed on Saturday. “That’s not somebody sitting in their basement, that’s pretty sophisticated,” he said. Officials across the country are also assessing the make-up of the agitators mixed in with legitimate protestors. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Sunday he “wouldn’t be surprised if Antifa” was behind some of the actions in his city. “We don’t have the specific information they’re directly engaged, but we have intel, we have watched and intercepted, frankly, groups coming into Denver. We have confiscated weapons, including assault weapons, that were heading to the demonstrations.” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said the city too is trying to determine the role of those behind the violence, telling CNN, “We have yet to unpack of the arrests we made who the instigators are and their locations. We’re anxious to find out.” In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said looters organized across the city and possibly came in from outside: “There clearly was coordination, they were clearly listening to our radio traffic,” she said. “The number of U-Haul trucks that magically showed up in front of stores, car caravans that dropped people off and broke windows, and then were hustling the goods out into the backs of the cars. Absolutely, it was organized — there’s no question whatsoever about that.” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney on Sunday denounced what he called “anarchists” for the looting and vandalism that occurred Saturday night in his city and claimed rhetoric from the White House was “perpetuating” the violence. In New York, investigators are also searching social media to identify leaders who are trying to get protestors to gather to incite violence, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators there have seen antagonizers more affiliated with Antifa and far-left causes, and not necessarily white supremacist groups. “They do not represent the peaceful New Yorkers that want to protest,” the official said. Foreign influence looms, too Allegations of foreign influence attempting to influence and stoke the disruption in the US have quickly followed the violence coming out of the protests. O’Brien pointed to Chinese social media messages gloating about the chaos. On ABC’s “This Week,” he also acknowledged some Russian activists and mentioned Zimbabwe and Iran. But the role and effectiveness of foreign actors is hard to measure — some suggest their role is additive, not initiating any unrest. Rubio, who was appointed acting Intelligence Committee chairman earlier this month, tweeted Saturday he was seeing “VERY heavy social media activity on #protests & counter reactions from social media accounts linked to at least 3 foreign adversaries.” Rubio may have been basing some of his information on analysis from Graphika, a company that helped the committee with its report on Russia’s social media influence during the 2016 elections. Graphika CEO John Kelly sent information to Senate Intelligence Committee leadership on Saturday, which was obtained by CNN. “Yes, we are seeing very active engagement with the issue from clusters of social accounts in the social media influence networks of Russia, Iran, and China,” Kelly said. “Our team is actively monitoring the situation now, including growing activity around the ‘Boogaloo’ movement, which is pushing for a ‘Second American Civil War.'” CNN has reached out to Graphika for comment about what is behind their analysis.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (CNN) — DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday that protesters have the right to exercise the First Amendment but should not “destroy our city” after the nation’s capital experienced its second consecutive night of protests as well as some looting Saturday night. “We’re sending a very clear message to people that they have a right to exercise their First Amendment rights, but not to destroy our city,” Bowser said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We saw a level of just destruction and mayhem among some that was maddening.” The DC Fire Department extinguished two vehicle fires in the area north of the White House Saturday night, as well as several small fires in the downtown area. Some protesters also put up graffiti on some buildings. DC Chief of Police Peter Newsham said Sunday that the Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 17 people Saturday night and that 11 MPD officers were injured during the protests. None of the officers sustained life-threatening injuries, though one officer is undergoing surgery for multiple compound fractures to his leg after a protester threw a rock at him. Newsham said that of the 17 people arrested, eight either live in DC or have some ties to the area. He said police expect to make more arrests, as the department is asking private businesses to review their security footage, and will ask the DC community to help identify those who were damaging property or hurting people. More than 60 US Secret Service personnel were injured from Friday night through Sunday morning near the White House, according to a statement from the Secret Service. Bowser tweeted that the city would be under a curfew from 11 PM ET Sunday night through 6 AM ET Monday. The Democratic mayor urgedPresident Donald Trump to help “calm the nation” and to stop sending “divisive tweets that are meant to harken back to the segregationist past of our country.” On Saturday, Trump wrongly accused Bowser in a tweet of not allowing the DC Metropolitan Police Department to help the Secret Service keep control of the situation with protesters in Lafayette Square on Friday night. That claim was later refuted by the US Secret Service who confirmed in a statement that the DC police department and US Park police were on the scene. Bowser responded to Trump on Twitter Saturday, saying that the DC police department, “will always protect DC and all who are in it whether I agree with them (such as those exercising their First Amendment Right) or those I don’t (namely, @realdonaldtrump).” The DC mayor said while Trump “hides behind his fence afraid/alone,” she stands with people “peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder” of Floyd and “hundreds of years of institutional racism.” Trump also tweeted that protesters “would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,” if they breached the fence outside the White House. In a press conference Saturday, Bowser noted how Trump’s reference to the “ominous dogs” was “no subtle reminder” of segregationists who would attack African Americans with dogs. Bowser said Sunday that the city is working on cleaning up after protests and is coordinating with law enforcement “to ensure calm in our city.” Skirmishes between groups of protesters and law enforcement flared Saturday evening nearby Trump’s residence for the second consecutive night as tensions played out over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in Minneapolis who was pinned down by police. Some protesters continued to gather in downtown Washington, DC, at Lafayette Square, which is across from the White House, into Saturday evening, but additional protesters were not being allowed in by police. At times there were attempts by some protesters to enter the park. They were met with pepper spray or other mechanisms pushing them back. Separately, a group marched and then rallied at the Lincoln Memorial. At one point onlookers reported pepper spray being used. The area around the memorial was then cleared. Law enforcement’s aim was to erect a large space between the protesters and the White House. Authorities wanted to prevent a large number of protesters from gathering at the barriers which are permanently set up in front of the White House. Newsham called the behavior of police “incredibly responsible, heroic, in many instances,” and said he doesn’t expect Sunday night to be “a repeat of last night.” Still, a law enforcement source tells CNN that US Park Police, in a situational report Sunday afternoon, informed law enforcement stationed in Lafayette Park that demonstrators have brought boxes of rocks to an evening protest across from the White House. Another person was observed with a bat, the report stated. The information was shared with other law enforcement agencies on hand for the protest, the source said. Earlier Sunday, White House executive office staff received an email urging them to stay away from the White House complex, if possible, due to “ongoing demonstrations.” “Due to ongoing demonstrations, please avoid coming to the White House Complex today if at all possible,” the email reads, in part. “The White House currently maintains an elevated security posture.” The email directs “essential” employees, who still need to work on the complex, to a specific entrance and to follow Secret Service instructions.

Across the country, protests have erupted following the recent death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the most recent in a series of deaths of black Americans by the police. (Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images) ATLANTA (AP) — Two police officers have been fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest incident involving two college students, Atlanta’s mayor said Sunday. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch.” The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman was released without charges. She said the man was released, too, and she’s ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn’t specify what charges he faced. She didn’t identify the students or the officers. She said she’d delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. “I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,” Shields said. “And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.” Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she’d also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn’t yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers’ behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. “Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that’s before you,” Shields said. “When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,” Shields said. “For some reason, we’ve fallen into a gray area where there’s a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we’re in now we have to change how we manage internally.” Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. The officer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he’ll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police were investigating the cause of the collision. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

Protestors marched to the Flint Township Police Department Headquarters where they were met by police in riot gear. Swanson deescalated the situation by asking one of the protesters what he wanted of them. They replied to walk with us and so he did with some of his deputies.Xxx 053020 Flint Township P 9 Jpg Usa Mi (CNN) — A Michigan sheriff joined protesters in Flint Township on Saturday, putting down his weapon and saying, “I want to make this a parade, not a protest.” Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson spoke with demonstrators who were met by police officers in riot gear, local affiliate WEYI reported. “The only reason we’re here is to make sure that you got a voice — that’s it,” Swanson said in video clips shown on Twitter. “These cops love you — that cop over there hugs people,” he said, pointing to an officer. He was speaking to the crowd protesting police brutality and the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He smiled and high-fived people in the crowd, who responded by chanting, “walk with us!” So, he did. “Let’s go, let’s go,” Swanson said as he and the cheering crowd proceeded. “Where do you want to walk? We’ll walk all night.” Flint has drawn national attention for its water crisis, which began in 2014, when city and state officials switched the city’s water supply to save money. It exposed residents to dangerously high levels of lead and resulted in more than a dozen lawsuits. FLINT WATER CRISIS FACTS But Saturday’s event offered a welcome contrast to violent confrontations in cities across the country. People took to social media to champion Swanson’s actions. “This is the correct response from police #WalkWithUs,” Gwen Campbell tweeted. JJ Milliken, another Swanson supporter, said via Twitter: “#WalkWithUs is how we change a system that murdered #GeorgeFloyd. It requires mindfulness of our actions and beliefs. Chris Swanson exemplifies the deputies and officers I know and respect. Community-first mentality and lead by example. This is a mindful action. This is change.” CNN is attempting to reach the Genesee County Sheriff’s office for comment. On Friday Swanson addressed George Floyd’s death via a Facebook post. “I join with the chorus of citizens and law enforcement officials alike, calling for the swift arrest and prosecution of each police officer involved in this appalling crime,” he wrote. “The actions we witnessed on that video destroy countless efforts to bolster community policing efforts across our nation, and erode trust that is painstakingly built.”",0.0

In Atlanta, NBA players helped organize a march for justice and called for change. In Germany, soccer players from England and France amplified that message on the pitch. On social media, white athletes spoke not just of support for justice for African-Americans, but of recognition of their own ignorance of abiding injustice. Coaches, franchises and athletic departments broadcast sweeping support for African-American communities, for empathy and for a path to positive change. And a broader mood, defiant and demanding, suggested the public may not allow sports figures and institutions to sit on the sideline regarding prominent social issues any longer. “People are going to look back,” Pacers star Malcolm Brogdon told the crowd during a peaceful protest in his hometown of Atlanta. “Our kids are going to look back at this and say, ‘You were a part of that.’ I’ve got a grandfather who marched next to Dr. (Martin Luther) King in the ’60s. He was amazing. He would be proud to see us here.” The deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky., drove fresh pain into old wounds in communities across the country. Social media amplified those messages. Video of Brogdon’s speech — delivered at a protest organized in part by Boston Celtics player and fellow Atlanta native Jaylen Brown — was liked and shared thousands of times across multiple platforms within 24 hours. With most sports leagues halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was the principle method for athletes to offer leadership, show support and even acknowledge their own failings in coming to terms with the injustices protesters have highlighted from coast to coast this weekend. More:Butler coach joins comments on aftermath of George Floyd death In Indianapolis:Police fire tear gas hours before curfew “Institutional racism in this country breaks my heart and needs to stop,” Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz wrote in a message posted to Twitter on Thursday evening. “(I) can’t even fathom what the black community has to endure on a daily basis. Being from North Dakota, I’ve spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I’m never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already. “I’ll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. However, I do know that we are all equal at the foot of the cross and Jesus taught us to value others’ lives like they were our own — regardless of skin tone.” Wentz was not alone in his sport. In a pair of tweets Friday, Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence demanded “a shift in the way of thinking.” “Justice must outweigh injustice. Love must outweigh hate,” Lawrence wrote. “I’m siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience. The injustice is clear … and so is the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you’re still ‘explaining’ it — check your heart and ask why.” Athletes also challenged the public to engage in that kind of introspection as well. ""I keep getting asked by white people 'What can I do?' Well, for one, you can stop asking OTHERS what you should do and ask YOURSELF what you should do,"" former Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin posted on social media. ""Be empathetic. What would you do if that was your son, your brother, your husband, your father? ""And then, once you connect back with humanity, make a decision to act. Donate your time, your money, your intellectual ingenuity and your human spirit to make change. Don’t be complacent and complicit. And challenge others to not be either."" Sports executives and coaches across multiple leagues were not shy in voicing their frustration, or supporting a broader call for justice. Those who did not speak up, or spoke late, or inadequately in the public’s view, found themselves facing criticism. No entity felt this more pointedly than the NFL, which released a three-paragraph statement Saturday evening. The public was quick to point out the league’s opposition to quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s peaceful protests of police brutality during the playing of the national anthem as far back as 2016. Kaepernick’s protest — first sitting, then kneeling, during the anthem — and his subsequent excommunication from the NFL, sowed division among the league’s fans and, in the eyes of many, cheapened this weekend’s statement. Elsewhere in the sports world, prominent figures were unabashed in their desire to speak loudly and clearly. In the Toronto Globe and Mail, Raptors President Masai Ujiri wrote about his reaction to the now-widespread video showing a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd calls out in distress, before falling silent. “No one can deny,” Ujiri wrote, “the police have a tough job. But they are peace officers. They are supposed to protect all of us. This is the profession they chose. I didn’t see any peace or protection when that officer had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck. I saw indifference. “The ‘order’ in ‘law and order’ should not mean the deadly suppression of people of color; it should mean preserving a society so we can all feel free and safe, to live in peace with each other.” In a lengthy statement posted to the Miami Dolphins' social media accounts, coach Brian Flores repeated a message he said he delivers to his players: “My message to them and to anyone else who wants to listen is that honesty, transparency and empathy go a long way in bringing people together and making change. I hope the tragedies of the last few weeks will open our hearts and minds to a better way of communicating and hopefully create that change.” Indiana University football coach Tom Allen posted a message to his Twitter account Friday afternoon saying, “Racial injustice is WRONG and it must be addressed!! I believe we are to LOVE EACH OTHER! No matter one’s skin color. Love is a choice.” ""I just felt like silence was wrong. There’s just so much going on, so much emotion, even from myself, from what I saw happen, and just knowing so many players came to my mind, our current guys. My heart was broken for them,"" Allen said in a separate interview with IndyStar. ""I know how our players have struggled with that. In talking with them, I knew they were really hurting. Their families, there was fear and anxiety and anger. I just couldn’t be quiet. It was the right thing to do."" The University of Tennessee athletic department went a step further, releasing a department-wide call for action. “It’s time to demand change,” the tweet accompanying the statement read. “It’s time to demand progress. The standard of empathy, respect and equity is one we must meet.” In what Tennessee termed “a unified statement from our head coaches,” department leadership called on fans to “rise to the challenge to meet a new standard. If you’re going to support our black student-athletes when they compete, please have the courage to support them and their families in their daily pursuit of peace, happiness and equity.” Sports brands stepped up as well. Nike released an ad Friday evening advocating awareness and action. Adidas, Nike’s greatest industry rival, shared Nike’s message on social media. “For once,” the ad read, white words set against a black background, “don’t do it. Don’t pretend there’s not a problem in America. Don’t turn your back on racism. Don’t accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don’t make any more excuses. Don’t think this doesn’t affect you. Don’t sit back and be silent. Don’t think you can’t be part of the change. Let’s all be part of the change.” Where athletes could use the platform of the field to promote their message, they spanned an ocean in a moment. In Germany, Borussia Monchengladbach’s Marcus Thuram knelt and bowed his head after scoring a goal in a 4-1 victory over Union Berlin. Later that afternoon, Englishman Jadon Sancho, playing for Borussia Dortmund, removed his jersey after scoring a goal to reveal an undershirt bearing the words “Justice for George Floyd.” Sports have long played a role in the effort for wider social justice, from Joe Louis, to Jesse Owens, to Jackie Robinson, to Tommie Smith and John Carlos, to Kaepernick. But, in a country where 67 percent of people identify themselves as sports fans, according to statista.com, there is increasingly a feeling that there is no more time — and no more room — for silence. “There is a sense of helplessness,” Ujiri wrote in the Globe and Mail, “but that must not paralyze us. Your voice matters, especially when you are a leader or influential figure, and especially if you are white.

General Joseph Lengyel, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, said some 16,000 additional Guard troops have been deployed to 24 states and the District of Columbia in response to civil disturbances. Floyd died Monday after a Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; he and three other officers were fired from the force after video of Floyd’s death emerged. The latest deployment brought the total number of deployed National Guard members to about 62,000 across the country. Other Guard members already had been deployed to assist with their governments’ COVID-19 relief efforts. The Guard announced in a news release that it expected the civil unrest response mission to grow as governors assess each situation in their states. “We plan, train and prepare for emergency response missions with our local, state, and federal partners,” he said. “We’re part of the communities we serve. We know the police, fire departments and hospital workers. We know their capabilities because we live with their capabilities.” The deployment came as riots erupted from demonstrations in cities from San Francisco to Boston protesting the death of Floyd. People robbed stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, California, and a driver sped a semitrailer toward a massive crowd of people assembled on a highway in Minneapolis — but remarkably, there were no initial reports of anyone hurt aside from that driver. In neighboring St. Paul, thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol, pledging to keep up the protests. BUILDINGS AROUND WHITE HOUSE BOARD UP, PROTECT VALUABLES AMID POSSIBILITY OF MORE PROTEST VANDALISM The scale of the protests, spanning from San Francisco to Boston and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. More than two dozen mayors and governors have imposed curfews, a level not seen the unrest following the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., The New York Times reported. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Vandals defaced buildings in cities across the U.S., from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words — “I can’t breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House.

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Follow this story:For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up to get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” George Floyd protests:Records dispute claims that most people arrested came from outside Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. Peaceful marches, burning cars:Protests for George Floyd take varying turns “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

No racist police."" ""How many?"" ""Too many."" ""Say his name?"" ""George Floyd."" As protesters marched through the heart of Richmond on Sunday afternoon, the chants kept coming. Emotions — and eventually some of the voices — were raw. But unlike the scenes that played out in cities across the country over the weekend, in Richmond, there was no rioting, looting or vandalism. Just a nearly 90-minute trek up and down city streets. Hundreds came to the Whitewater Valley Gorge Park for a protest against police violence sparked by the death last week in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody as an officer knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes. The scene was captured on video that spread through social media, sparking fresh outrage with each share and like. In Richmond, Sunday's event began next to the Starr-Gennett Building as an organizer told the crowd the most important thing to remember as the day went along. ""What's the rule?"" he asked. ""Be chill,"" the audience responded. Then a handful of those in attendance took turns sharing stories of their personal encounters with law enforcement. One talked about the effect solitary confinement had on him. Another spoke of being stopped while walking home from work as a minor and asked for documentation to prove he wasn't in the country illegally. Another described being autistic and a fight he got into with a bully. Officers threatened to put him in a jail cell with child molesters, he said. After a moment of silence and a prayer, the march itself began. The line of protesters made its way up the East Main Street hill toward the Richmond Municipal Building (home of the Richmond Police Department headquarters) and the Wayne County Courthouse. There was a brief stop at the Wayne County Jail as protesters filled the outside vestibule and chanted ""I can't breathe"" and ""Black lives matter"" before continuing on their way. The route eventually would wind its way around the courthouse before heading east along South A Street then turning at South 12th and again at North A, circling the downtown area but keeping off the storefront-lined section of East Main Street. A trip over the Main Street Bridge would lead to South West Third Street and then National Road West before what was left of those in the march made their way along South Second Street back to East Main and then the park again. As the protesters navigated the circuitous path, RPD cars sped ahead of them to block traffic from connecting streets and clear a path. Officers stood and watched as the train of people passed. Some in the stopped traffic showed their support for the protest, honking their horns and shouting encouragement. Each time, the protesters erupted in cheers and applause. A van filled with water bottles awaited those who made the entire trip back to East Main near the road leading to the park. After that, the crowd quickly dispersed, having said what it came to say and having abided by the rule of the day: Be chill. Jason Truitt is the team leader and senior reporter at the Palladium-Item.

INDIANAPOLIS — Police reported a handful of arrests Sunday night after an 8 p.m. curfew went into effect in Indianapolis and Marion County. FOX59 crews saw up to a dozen people detained in the city, with many of the incidents happening near Washington and Pennsylvania downtown. The downtown area, for the most part, was quiet Sunday night, a far cry from Friday and Saturday nights when large protests turned into riots that left businesses damaged. A largely peaceful protest and march took place during the afternoon. Protesters yelled, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and gathered at Monument Circle. As the protest wore on, police said over loudspeakers that the assembly had “become unlawful” and ordered the crowd to break up. Protests have erupted across the country over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Around 6 p.m., two hours before the 8 p.m. curfew was to go into effect, police officers fired tear gas and pepper balls to break up the crowds. IMPD Chief Randal Taylor held a news conference minutes after the curfew began, telling people they were better off staying home. Taylor also addressed the use of chemical agents Sunday night. “Just like last night, whenever officers feel in danger or we’ve seen criminal activity occurring, that’s usually the reason we’re releasing the tear gas or pepper ball,” Taylor said during the brief news conference. “Go home for yourself, go home for your family, go home for your city,” Taylor said. “There is nothing you will prove tonight by violating this order.” The Indiana Department of Transportation shut down several ramps Sunday night to aid with the Indianapolis curfew: I-70 WB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 SB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 NB to Washington St I-65 NB/SB to MLK",0.0

We urge Governor Holcomb to issue an immediate executive order to immediately ban law enforcement from using chokehold restraints, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. This order must include specific repercussions officers will face for violating this ban. If there is no action by the governor, we urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish a local policy that outlaws the use of a chokehold restraint, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. Additionally, we urge these entities to immediately implement the use of body cameras for all patrol officers and require them to be on at all times. If not, a penalty should be assessed. We urge the governor to immediately establish a Statewide Criminal Justice Commission, including a diverse appointing of civilian representatives from the cities with significant African American populations, to examine every aspect of our state’s criminal justice system and recommend comprehensive criminal justice reform, including the eradication of racist policing policies. We expect these recommendations to become bills that get passed in the 2021 Legislative Session. We urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish local Independent Civilian Review Boards, with members selected by local community activist groups, to review public complaints of police violence. 1:00 p.m. - Mayor Joe Hogsett and IMPD Chief Randal Taylor are providing a public safety update. Mayor Hogsett said the department is changing and updating guidelines for use of force including the following: The department's standard for using deadly force is being updated. The department is updating the requirement for identification and warning before deadly force is used. IMPD will be prohibited from using chokeholds - currently the department does not train or condone the use of chokeholds. De-escalation requirements and training for officers. Duty to intervene or report when another officer uses inappropriate force. Prohibits shooting into a moving vehicle or from a moving vehicle. Comprehensive reporting of lethal and nonlethal uses of force. Rules for using various levels of less-than-lethal force. Mayor Hogsett said everyone in Indianapolis and beyond needs to work every day for change. IMPD Chief Taylor said the officers in the department are working to build bridges with the community, but he understands the mistrust. He said the department will work to improve that relationship. Chief Taylor said he has appreciated the peaceful protests and looks forward to those peaceful protests continuing. IMPD said peaceful protests will be allowed and encouraged this weekend, but any violence or chaos will be handled by the department. IMPD said it will take an education approach first to the 8 p.m. curfew for Friday and Saturday. IMPD said if the protests remain peaceful, they may be allowed to continue past curfew. There will also be a traffic pattern change at that time to help people exit the city and return home. Mayor Hogsett said the city is continuing to review use of force in some of the incidents from the past weekend involving officers that was caught on camera. Chief Taylor said he did not like what he saw in the videos, but is waiting for more information. When asked about Dreasjon Reed and releasing the officer's name that shot and killed him, Chief Taylor said that because of threats to officers, that information is not being released at this time. 8:15 a.m. - The curfew in Indianapolis this weekend will be in effect from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, then again from 8 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday.

To the men and women of IMPD: thank you for protecting first amendment rights, under difficult conditions, as our community wrestles with necessary change. And to those who have chosen the path of nonviolent protest—we see you, we hear you, and we will work with you over the coming days, weeks, and months. For the safety of what we believe will be much larger demonstrations this weekend, and given the violence and property damage we experienced this past weekend, we intend to reinstate the curfew order for Friday and Saturday.

1621885564,2020-05-31 22:00:06,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",http://www.journalgazette.net/news/politics/20200531/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"WASHINGTON — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ------ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

1621885552,2020-05-31 22:00:04,Indiana Tech student loses eye during Saturday's protest,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/police-fire/20200531/indiana-tech-student-loses-eye-during-saturdays-protest,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"Balin Brake, a 21-year-old Indiana Tech student, said he lost his right eye Saturday after a tear gas canister hit the right side of his head during downtown demonstrations to protest police treatment of blacks. Brake spoke by telephone Sunday from his Lutheran Hospital room and said he was standing in the street just off the curb on Clinton Street at the Allen County Courthouse as officers in riot gear approached. He had been separated from two of his friends who later tracked him through a phone app and discovered he was at Lutheran Hospital. At the protest scene, Brake said two men carried him over to a police car and begged the officer to call medics. ""He (Brake) saw it (the canister) hit the ground after it hit him,"" his mother, Rachel Simonis, said Sunday after early morning surgery was performed and his eye was not salvaged. Doctors told her there was ""nothing left but the shell of his eye."" An opthalmologist and plastic surgeon operated on Brake. Sofia Rosales-Scatena, public information officer for the Fort Wayne Police Department, issued a statement Sunday denying that an officer directly targeted Brake. ""According to our officers on the ground, the protester was still in the area after commands to leave the area were given. Gas was deployed in the area and the protester bent over to pick up the canister to throw it back at officers as many others were trying to do. When he bent over, another canister was deployed in the area and that canister skipped and hit the protester in the eye. There was no deliberate deployment of gas to any persons head,"" the statement read. Brake, a weekend editor at a local television station, and his mother heard a different story from his employer who had reporters on scene. ""The owner of (the station) called to see how things were going with Balin. When Balin was struck in the eye, he said a couple of his newscasters saw Balin get hit in the eye. Balin fell to the ground and they (police) left him laying on the ground and two men picked him up and took him to safety, towards the police and a police officer called an ambulance. They just left him laying there in the street,"" Simonis said. Brake said he made no attempt to pick up the canister and throw it back at police. ""Absolutely not. I was not wearing gloves. Those canisters are hot as hell. I would not try to pick them up with my bare hands. In fact, one of them hit my shoe and burned my laces off."" In a few weeks, Brake, a Northrop High School graduate who is studying communications with a concentration on journalism and broadcasting, will undergo another operation to repair eye fractures and be fitted for a prosthetic eye, Simonis said. A Facebook page ""Balin’s medical fundraiser"" was set up to help cover medical costs. Simonis said her son is a gentle person who went downtown to stand up for what he believes in. Brake said losing his eye was ""small collateral for the battle we’re fighting."" He believes white privilege is real and ""if you’re not going to use it to advocate for your fellow people, then that is just wrong."" In Brake's reckoning of the events, ""police need policing,"" and when police use tear gas, it should be aimed at the ground and ""not at people’s bodies and heads."" jduffy@jg.net",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Follow this story:For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up to get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” George Floyd protests:Records dispute claims that most people arrested came from outside Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. Peaceful marches, burning cars:Protests for George Floyd take varying turns “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

(WPTA21) -- A photo that was posted to social media Saturday night showing people helping a three year old who'd been caught in some tear gas has been shared more than 30,000 times. We spoke with the woman in the photo as well as the child's mother for this exclusive story. ""I was trying to go home and I was gassed out of my vehicle,"" says mother Mechell Hensler. Hensler says her three-year-old daughter Gracie is doing better, a day after being hit with tear gas. She says she wasn't part of the protest, but was driving to her home south of downtown when they were caught in the crossfire. The girl's mother says she wasn't part of the protest, but was driving to her home south of downtown when they were caught in the crossfire. Jessica Farlow says she lives near downtown and was at the protests Saturday night equipped with a bag full of first aid. ""I ran over immediately to help and the child's face and their entire body was red with this capsaicin or pepper spray,"" she says. A bystander posted a photo of the aftermath, which has been shared nearly 40,000 times. You can see Jessica trying to spray a soothing mixture on Gracie to stop the burning. ""We spent about 10 minutes dousing her in Maalox and water and milk, taking her clothes off, treating her,"" Farlow says. But the worst was yet to come. ""I said she's only three, I'm not even here for the protest. We got gassed out of our vehicle. And he dead looked at my daughter and through the cannister in front of her, and it exploded in front of her face,"" Hensler says. ""The hard part for me was right when the second canister came. I had given her a cough drop, and she had looked at me and said thank you for the candy and she was smiling again. And I felt like we had done what we came to do. She was smiling, she wasn't scared. And then the second canister exploded. And all over again, everything we had just worked for was in her lungs and on her body, and she was naked because we had already taken her clothes off,"" Farlow says. Farlow says she's still shaken by what the girl went through. ""When I showered last night and it burned, I imagined those parents showering that child off and trying to explain to them why her skin is on fire. And I thought of my own babies, and I thought about how many of the other kids down here didn't have somebody to help them,"" she says.

By Leah Asmelash, CNN (CNN) -- Actor Kendrick Sampson said he was shot seven times with rubber bullets by police in Los Angeles on Saturday during a protest over the death of George Floyd. ""He pointed the gun DIRECTLY AT ME,"" Sampson wrote on Twitter, linking to an news report about his experience. ""I actually got hit 7 times with rubber bullets and many with batons. My boy has stitches."" Sampson, a vocal activist, was among thousands of people across the US who protested Floyd's death this weekend. Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last week at the hands of police. Four officers were involved in the incident and all have since been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. One former officer, Derek Chauvin, is seen in a video with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes. He was charged with with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Protesters say they want to see charges for all four police officers involved in the death of Floyd. Video of the event Sampson described was posted to Twitter by a friend of Sampson. The actor reshared the video to his own social media. The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. ""If LAPD didn't know cameras were on they would've done much WORSE,"" Sampson wrote on Twitter about the incident. ""They're organized crime, continuing the legacy of slave catching."" Sampson said he went to the emergency room after the incident for his injuries, photos of which he also posted on Instagram. Sunday marked the sixth day of protests. Though many of the nationwide protests began peacefully, some turned violent. At least 40 cities have imposed curfews and National Guard members have been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC.

He believes the majority of police are really trying to do good and help people. “How do you get to somebody who’s my age or your age or whoever’s age different ethnicity different color of skin that they feel how I feel, that cops aren’t out to get them but to protect them,” he said. Growing up as a white person from a middle-class background, he believes the issue of violence needs to be fixed, so African Americans and minorities can feel the same trust he feels towards law enforcement. “That’s the change that’s got to happen, that’s where we gotta get to. How to get to it? I don’t know, because we haven’t in a long time and this s*** keeps happening.” he said. “And I don’t ever recall a white guy getting choked out or a knee down. It always seems to be a black person. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.” BIG-CITY DEMS WHO HAD IMPOSED STRICT CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS NOW LET GEORGE FLOYD RIOTERS FLOUT RULES As protests — some turned violent — have broken out in cities throughout much of the U.S., including Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis, and Atlanta — Portnoy believes that type of behavior isn’t the answer. He allegedly cited Black Lives Matter and leaders of the African American community who he claims said that violence needs happen or else “northing ever changes.” “Maybe, I don’t know. Personally I don’t think that burning down businesses…is gonna solve it, I don’t think just looting is gonna solve it,” he said. “And with these protests, there’s no doubt, you have people who are out there for the right reasons, and then you just have scum****. Like you have scu**** cops, you have scu**** protesters.” “Taking advantage, looting robbing, what the f***. And then it all gets convoluted, everyone’s picking sides, and there is no side. Everyone should be on the same fu***** side here. It shouldn’t matter if you’re black or white in this country, it really shouldn’t.” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms gave an emotional speech on Saturday morning, citing the actions of looters who smashed windows and threw bottles, rocks and knives at law enforcement as “not a protest” and “not Atlanta.” “You’re not honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement,” Bottoms said. “When you burn down this city, you’re burning down our community.” Dr. Bernice King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr., also appealed to the protesters saying the “only way to achieve constructive change is through non-violent means.” Portnoy also discussed the lack of oversight for Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer seen kneeling on George Floyd’s — who reportedly had a history of violence.

The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have elevated fears of a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Images showing thousands of screaming, unmasked protesters have sent shudders through the health community, who worry their calls for social distancing during the demonstrations are unlikely to be heard. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MIAMI (AP) — In hindsight, Rosa Jimenez Cano realizes that attending a protest against police brutality was risky — and not just for the usual reasons. “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,” the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night’s protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd’s death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sundaychanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

INDIANAPOLIS — Police reported a handful of arrests Sunday night after an 8 p.m. curfew went into effect in Indianapolis and Marion County. CBS4 crews saw up to a dozen people detained in the city, with many of the incidents happening near Washington and Pennsylvania downtown. The downtown area, for the most part, was quiet Sunday night, a far cry from Friday and Saturday nights when large protests turned into riots that left businesses damaged. A largely peaceful protest and march took place during the afternoon. Protesters yelled, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and gathered at Monument Circle. As the protest wore on, police said over loudspeakers that the assembly had “become unlawful” and ordered the crowd to break up. Protests have erupted across the country over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Around 6 p.m., two hours before the 8 p.m. curfew was to go into effect, police officers fired tear gas and pepper balls to break up the crowds. IMPD Chief Randal Taylor held a news conference minutes after the curfew began, telling people they were better off staying home. Taylor also addressed the use of chemical agents Sunday night. “Just like last night, whenever officers feel in danger or we’ve seen criminal activity occurring, that’s usually the reason we’re releasing the tear gas or pepper ball,” Taylor said during the brief news conference. “Go home for yourself, go home for your family, go home for your city,” Taylor said. “There is nothing you will prove tonight by violating this order.” The Indiana Department of Transportation shut down several ramps Sunday night to aid with the Indianapolis curfew: I-70 WB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 SB to Fletcher/Ohio/Michigan I-65 NB to Washington St I-65 NB/SB to MLK",0.0

Two people died in shootings, though it wasn't clear their deaths were related to the protests.  Mayor Joe Hogsett said the curfew from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday comes after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction.  ""It is clear after last night that we can no longer provide the protection of those protesters or our downtown residents and business owners when an unfortunate few are so determined to hijack this movement for their own selfish reasons,"" Hogsett said.  The two people killed in downtown Indianapolis were shot amid several shootings reported late Saturday and early Sunday. Police said no officers fired their guns.  Deputy Police Chief Josh Barker said one person was arrested in one of the deaths, but that connections between the gunfire and the protests remained uncertain and under investigation.  Kansas City  Business owners in Kansas City and Ferguson were assessing damage and cleaning up Sunday after protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the general treatment of blacks by police devolved into violence. Gov. Mike Parson activated the Missouri National Guard on Saturday and the Missouri State Highway Patrol was brought in to help local law enforcement agencies cope with the protests, which were expected to resume in later Sunday at least in Kansas City.  Police blocked access to Kansas City's trendy Country Club Plaza early Sunday to allow businesses to check out the damage from the protest that started Saturday. About 85 people were arrested and 10 people suffered non-life threatening injuries in Kansas City.  In Ferguson, seven officers were injured by rocks, bottles and fireworks, and several businesses and the Ferguson police headquarters were damaged. Police in both cities used tear gas to disperse crowds.  Chicago  Chicago Mayor Lori Lighfoot says access to downtown is restricted to only to residents and essential workers and the National Guard will have a presence in the city as officials seek to stem violence arising from demonstrations following the police killing of George Floyd.  Lightfoot again Sunday praised peaceful protesters, saying she stands ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" with those condemning Floyd's death after Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck during an arrest earlier this week. But she said that in order to protect the city, the state has agreed to dispatch ""a contingent of the National Guard"" to take up a ""limited presence.""  She says bus and train service to the downtown Loop is temporarily suspended. Drawbridges that span several stretches of the Chicago River in and out of the area are raised to limit vehicle access. And Lightfoot says a citywide 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will remain in effect indefinitely. Officials say there were 240 arrests Saturday night and early Sunday, and that six people were shot, one fatally, in the Loop during a four-hour span Saturday evening.  Los Angeles  Armed National Guard soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles on Sunday as the city began cleaning up after a night of violence that saw demonstrators clash repeatedly with officers, torch police vehicles and pillage businesses. Fire crews responded to dozens of blazes, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the neighborhood, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. One officer suffered a fractured skull, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said.  Windows were shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of Melrose Avenue. At Tony K's Shoe Store, owner Alan Kokozian said his entire product stock was either stolen or damaged.  Kokozian said he was hit in the head with a flying bottle as he pleaded with looters to spare his establishment Saturday evening.  ""This was not a political protest. This was basically a bunch of thieves getting together taking advantage of a situation,"" Kokozian said Sunday as he surveyed the hole in his roof caused by fire.  Security camera footage showed a swarm of people shattering the front window of DTLA Smoke Shop in downtown Los Angeles early Saturday. Within a minute they had emptied the store's shelves and fled.  ""I'm so angry. I'm so angry. You know, it's my life, I put everything into it,"" owner Natali Mishali told KCAL-TV. ""I'm for speaking for human rights. I believe in that. I'm very passionate about that. This is just an excuse to steal.""  Portland  Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced that his city's curfew would continue and starts again at 8 p.m. Sunday. For a second night, people in Portland roamed city streets.  Officers said some threw projectiles at them. According to a statement, fireworks and ""aerial mortars"" were thrown at the Multnomah County Courthouse late Saturday.  In a tweet Sunday morning, Wheeler, Portland's mayor, wrote: ""Agitators are not led by a conviction to change systemic racism. They are opportunists, using the cover of legitimate protests to sow fear in our communities. Don't let them.""  Goldsboro, N.C.  The North Carolina minister who has mobilized people nationally with his Poor People's Campaign reacted to protests gripping the nation, saying systemic racism and economic inequality have gone on for too long.  ""Thank God people are in the streets, refusing to accept what has been seen as normal for too long,"" said the Rev. William J. Barber in a sermon telecast from his Greenleaf Christian Church in North Carolina.  He called the video replay of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has sparked huge demonstrations in cities across the United States, ""viscerally reminiscent of lynching photos used to terrorize African-Americans for decades in this nation and literally terrorize the nation.""  In what he called a pastoral letter to the nation, Barber said the interlocking injustices of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, a war economy and a false moral narrative of religious nationalism all must be addressed together.  Denver  City crews spent Sunday morning scrubbing graffiti off buildings and cleaning streets in a scene playing out across the country after nationwide protests turned turbulent and destructive.  Many of the businesses in downtown Denver boarded up their store fronts, with some covered in graffiti such as ""I can't breathe."" Buildings throughout downtown were scrawled with graffiti with messages like ""Kill Cops!"" At the top of the Capitol's West Steps, graffiti on the windows above the three entrances read ""Stop Killing Us.""  Police were searching for the person driving the vehicle who they say intentionally struck a police cruiser after the nearby protest had largely broken up in downtown Denver. Two of the injured officers were out of the hospital; all three are expected to recover, Denver police tweeted.  Salt Lake City  In Salt Lake City, where 41 demonstrators were arrested after they lit a police car on fire and struck an officer with a bat Saturday night, city officials reflected Sunday morning on the situation facing the nation as crews scrubbed graffiti from buildings and cleaned empty streets.  ""We are all hurting from this week and yesterday in particular was heartbreaking for our city and cities across the country, but this is about something much deeper and longer lasting than a protest or a riot,"" said Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall, a Democratic former city councilwoman who is in her first year as mayor.  ""We will recover and we will recover coming together to rebuild policies and to address, unearth, unpack the systemic racism that exists in this city and in every city across this nation.""  Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said he wants to hear from people how his officers can do better, but said, ""We cannot have meaningful conversations in a riotous situation.""  Detroit  Police in Detroit arrested dozens more people during continued protests over the death of George Floyd. The Detroit Police Department says Sunday that of the 84 people taken into custody Saturday night 63 don't live in the city and two live outside Michigan.  Sixty people were arrested during demonstrations Friday night and early Saturday morning. Of that number, 37 live outside Detroit.  The protests in Detroit were among others held in cities across the United States.  Washington  George Floyd's family attorney Ben Crump says he thinks more serious murder charges should be filed against the white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck as he begged for air.  Crump says he believes there's enough evidence to show the officer's actions were premeditated.  Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged last week with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, which are filed in cases of unintentional death. Chauvin also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd, a black man, as he lay handcuffed on the ground.  Crump tells CBS: ""We don't understand how that is not first-degree murder.""  According to the complaint, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes, including nearly three minutes after he stopped moving and talking.  An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death.  Seattle  Seattle will again have a 5 p.m. city-wide curfew Sunday and police say they arrested at least 27 people during Saturday protests over the killing of George Floyd.  Looters smashed downtown storefronts and at one point Interstate 5 was briefly closed through downtown when demonstrators got onto the roadway. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is dispatching up to 200 National Guard troops to help maintain order.  Charleston, S.C.  Some business owners in Charleston, South Carolina, swept up broken glass, boarded windows and took stock of ransacked shelves Sunday morning after protests erupted into violence.  Broken glass littered sidewalks outside storefronts in downtown Charleston, where restaurants and shops just recently reopened after being shutdown because of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people turned out Saturday for what began as peaceful protests in wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but spiraled into vandalism and violence overnight.  Brian Lucier found a large stone used to smash the front windows of his shop, King's Lead Cigar Lounge. ""All this just adds insult to injury,"" Lucier told The Post and Courier. ""We've been bleeding for three months now and then this happens.""  Charleston Police Chief Luther Reynolds said 10 people had been arrested in relation to the protests. He said there were no serious injuries.  However, diners and restaurant staff at the Stars Rooftop & Grill Room were rattled at about 8:30 p.m. Saturday when protesters started throwing chairs at the front window, said Heather Green, one of the restaurant's operators. She said staff locked the front door and evacuated customers through a back entrance before protesters smashed their way inside and ransacked the manager's office.  ""It started to feel like everything was going to be OK, and that we were finally getting back to normal,"" Greene said. ""And now this happens.""  Phoenix  Volunteers are using shovels and brooms to clean up broken glass outside at least five stores at an upscale mall in a Phoenix suburb.  The stores were damaged after a day of peaceful marches turned into a night of sometimes violent protests that included vandalism and an attack on a police station.  Late Saturday, people knelt with their hands up in the streets outside Phoenix police and municipal buildings, chanting, ""Hands up, don't shoot"" and ""Black lives matter.""  Officers used flash-bang grenades and dispersed the crowd shortly after 10 p.m., telling people it was an unlawful assembly.  In Scottsdale, some people smashed windows at stores including Neiman Marcus and Urban Outfitters, grabbing goods and damaging buildings.  On Sunday morning, TV station video showed large holes punched in some store windows with the glass completely shattered in the front windows of other stores.  Minneapolis  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says state authorities were hit by cyber attackers before law enforcement launched operations Saturday to clear protests.  Walz described the incident as a ""a very sophisticated denial of service attack"" and said it was executed on ""all computers."" He did not offer additional details.  Walz pointed to the hack as evidence that unrest in his state in recent days has been stoked by coordinated, outside groups trying to sow mayhem.  ""That's not somebody sitting in their basement,"" he told reporters. ""That's pretty sophisticated."" Minnesota authorities say 20% of those arrested had out-of-state addresses.  Philadelphia  Businesses in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh began to clean up Sunday after peaceful protests over George Floyd's death turned into a night of destruction in the two cities and others throughout the country.  In Philadelphia, business owners, workers and volunteers were sweeping up broken glass and boarding up smashed windows in blocks near Philadelphia's City Hall even as people could still be seen emerging from broken-into stores carrying bags.  Crews were also cleaning up anti-police and other graffiti scrawled on the walls of Philadelphia's City Hall. Both cities implemented citywide curfews that were to be in effect Sunday night as well. Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency declaration authorizing the adjutant general of the state National Guard and the Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner to activate personnel to help cities.  In Philadelphia, police said 100 people had been arrested as of early Sunday, including 43 for burglary and one for assault on a police officer. Police said 13 officers were injured, including a bike officer whose leg was broken when he was run over by suspect fleeing in a vehicle with stolen items from a business.  In Pittsburgh, the public safety department said 43 adults and one juvenile were arrested during the Saturday mayhem. Four police officers were injured but all had been discharged from local hospitals.  Atlanta  Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms says she doesn't have confidence in the U.S. Justice Department to fully investigate the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia as a civil rights crime.  Bottoms tells CBS' ""Face the Nation"" she is hopeful that appropriate charges will be brought and prosecuted if not by the Justice Department then the state of Georgia.  Arbery was killed Feb. 23 when a white father and son armed themselves and pursued the 25-year-old black man after spotting him running in their neighborhood. More than two months passed before Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, were arrested on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault.  Bottoms said Sunday: ""I don't have faith in this Justice Department, but if this Justice Department does what it was created to do, then justice will be served. But we also have the backstop of the state of Georgia.""",0.0

It wound up seeming like two distinct nights, with a protest that included Lafayette and West Lafayette mayors kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators early on, followed later by police in riot gear using tear gas canisters to push back crowds that grew unruly at the end. More than 1,000 people gathered in front of the Tippecanoe County Courthouse in downtown Lafayette to peacefully protest, before marching to Lafayette City Hall, up South Street to the Five Points intersection, across the Wabash River to the West Lafayette Village and to other points around the community. More: Tear gas came without warning, followed explosion as courthouse rally gave way to chaos The planned protest called ""Lafayette Peaceful March...Downtown"" began 8 p.m. Sunday and ended at 9 p.m., although large crowds were gathering and chanting phrases including ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""I can't breathe"" — something Floyd uttered as a police officer kept his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes the night he died — before the official start time. According to a Facebook post from one of the organizers, anything that happened after 9 p.m. was not part of their event.

(Photo: Nikos Frazier | Journal & Courier) ""We don’t believe this was anyway right, this was a horrendous act,"" Roswarski said of Floyd's death. ""We’re both law enforcement and we both wanted to be here today to show our support, and actually come out to the group and talk to them directly and give them a chance to talk to us. I’m not sure how many other places have had a unified front like this."" More: Crimes showed up in other parts of Lafayette after protesters dispersed from downtown The march itself remained largely peaceful, with the crowds quickly singling out any potential instigators and calming them down. At various points, the marching crowds were large enough to fill city streets for three and four blocks. More: IMPD chief: 'Please go home' as curfew takes effect One of the acts of transparency both Roswarski and Dennis pointed to in local law enforcement was the use of body cameras, which cannot not be turned off by the officer wearing it. ""As mayors, we understand the challenges that are going on out there,"" Dennis said. ""We understand the mistrust between the citizens and the police department. We're in the right position to be able to hear those complaints, educate the public and educate the police officers."" Brown said Sunday night's demonstration was a time for him to listen. ""Clearly, everyone has a lot of expectations of us,"" Brown said. ""And they're going to have a scorebook out to see what we do. ... What that is, at this point, I haven't got my head wrapped around that, yet."" Tiffany Pickett, a Lafayette resident, stood near the chanting at the courthouse, and was at the protest because she believes that ""black lives do matter."" ""We do need to help and support everyone's lives matter, but right now, black lives matter because we are the ones that are getting hurt, and our children, under the influence of the police,"" Pickett said. ""It shouldn't have to happen like that."" Eventually, protesters made their way across the Wabash River, up Chauncey Hill Mall and were briefly on Purdue’s campus before returning to the courthouse. As they marched back, the crowd stretched along State Street from the intersection of Northwestern Avenue to River Road. ""I think the country is having a visceral reaction because so much has built up for such a long time,"" a protester who asked to be identified by her first name, Hannah, said. ""Being there to support your community, being a body just showing up is great. And if you're able to, using your dollars to help as well is really important."" The crowd was still large, filling much of Columbia Street though not as thick as it had been an hour earlier, by the time people arrived back at the courthouse and lined the steps to a second-floor entry. Close to 11 p.m., there was commotion on the Tippecanoe County Courthouse landing, with people banging on the large, wooden doors and appearing to break a window. There were several scuffles on Columbia Street, as well, at the same time. Moments later police dropped several canisters of tear gas. If there was a warning from police to disperse, it wasn't clear to J&C reporters on the scene. Much of the crowd ran. Some, though, stayed and knelt in the street, chanting, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" Police coming from the east fired more tear gas, as police mobilized around the courthouse lawn.

Police blocked streets around the courthouse and slowly pushed crowds out of downtown, as clouds of tear gas billowed around lingering protesters — the majority of them white — taunted police. That scene was in contrast to earlier in the evening, when Tippecanoe County Sheriff Bob Goldsmith talked about how well the rally was going and how it had been a conscious decision not to have his deputies go shoulder-to-shoulder to greet demonstrators. That went, Goldsmith said early in the evening, when demonstrators went through orange snow fence meant to keep crowds off the courthouse steps. ""It's not really us against them,"" Goldsmith said, about an hour before things got out of hand. ""At least, it shouldn't be."" By 12:30 a.m., downtown had largely quieted, with police in tactical gear were supplemented by an arriving fleet of Indiana State Police cruisers. Overall damage to downtown was fairly minimal, compared with that in Indianapolis and other major cities in recent nights, with courthouse windows and a window of Purdue Federal Credit Union shattered near the corner of Fourth and Main streets.

A tally of arrests during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday was not immediately available. Police planned to release that information later Monday, said Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He said the city “was relatively quiet” during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. Several hundred people took part in a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon that started at the Indiana Statehouse. The group marched several blocks to outside the City-County Building, where those taking part laid on the ground while the names were read off of African Americans who have died in confrontations with police. The overnight curfew imposed by Mayor Joe Hogsett came after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, has sparked protests nationwide. Hogsett announced Monday that he was extending the city's curfew order for an additional night. His new order will begin at 8 p.m. Monday and will end at 4 a.m. Tuesday — two hours earlier than the mayor's first order – because Tuesday is Indiana's primary election, with voting starting at 6 a.m. Hogsett's order also includes an exception allowing people to travel during the curfew period for “election-related activities."" The mayor said in a statement that he was “proud of our residents, the vast majority of whom abided by Sunday night’s curfew order.” “My thanks go out to the men and women who helped keep Indianapolis peaceful overnight,"" Hogsett said. Two people died amid several shootings late Saturday and early Sunday, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. Police said no officers had fired their guns. One of those fatally shot was Chris Beaty, who was a defensive lineman on Indiana University’s football team from 2000 to 2004 and has recently managed Indianapolis nightclubs, The Indianapolis Star reported. Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting Saturday night a few blocks from downtown Indianapolis’ Monument Circle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Young said the circumstances of Beaty’s fatal shooting remained under investigation. “It’s still early on in the investigation and I don’t believe we have any suspects at this point. We have very limited information,” he said Monday morning. Beaty recently launched Worldwide Masks – a company that sells one-piece face coverings to prevent the spread of germs, with fellow entrepreneur Joe Babish, The Indianapolis Star reported. Indiana University football coach Tom Allen said in statement Monday that he was stunned by Beaty's death and heartbroken for his family. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating. Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me!"" Allen said. “His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" Large protests happened elsewhere in Indiana on Saturday, with police in Hammond using tear gas to break up protesters and officers blocking marchers from going onto Interstate 80/94. Fort Wayne police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd after Friday night’s demonstration resulted in some protesters throwing rocks at officers and breaking dozens of windows on downtown businesses.",0.0
1621935457,2020-06-01 01:00:00,US sees pockets of violence,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200601/us-sees-pockets-of-violence,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – Protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with violence flaring in pockets of largely peaceful demonstrations fueled by the killings of black people at the hands of police. A truck driver – apparently deliberately – drove into demonstrators in Minneapolis nearly a week after George Floyd died there after pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Protests sprang up from Boston to San Francisco, with people stealing from stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia, cities across California and elsewhere. In Minneapolis, the tanker truck sped into a peaceful crowd of thousands on a closed highway, but no one appeared to have been hit, authorities said. The Minnesota State Patrol tweeted that the driver was apparently trying to provoke protesters and was arrested. Protesters swarmed the truck and jumped on the hood, even as it kept moving. Police then came in force to clear the highway in the city where violence erupted after the death last week of Floyd, who was black. The protests spread to dozens of cities, and have lasted for days. The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck for several minutes has been charged with murder, but protesters demand the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We're not done,” said Darnella Wade, organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota's governor brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. On Sunday, in a display of force, lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them. For a second day, the protests reached to the White House, where chants could be heard from around 1,000 demonstrators just across the street in Lafayette Park as they faced police in riot gear behind barricades. The scene was defiant but peaceful, though police used flash bangs to stop another group from reaching the park. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force.” Across America, demonstrators called again for an end to police violence and many joined police in pleading for an end to the looting. Many also joined in pleading for a stop to fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and hundreds others through downtown Boston. “I'm so sick and tired of it.” Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.",0.0

Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back. “I was just horrified by what I saw,” Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.” Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city's Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer – subsequently charged with murder – pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we're seeing, I think it's deeper than that as a culture that's deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That's just my honest opinion. I think it's really ... part of a culture where it's deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days. Sefolosha – a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the Houston Rockets – considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I'm mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That's for sure. I mean, it's 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It's hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha's perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha's leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders' organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system, and I'm really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, 'OK, this is my duty as a human being,' the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, 'We are a clan, we stick together no matter what.' It should be the other way around.” The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. For obvious reasons, Sefolosha's mind isn't there yet. “I'll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,” Sefolosha said. “But you know, we're human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it's definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.”",0.0

The Minnesota Timberwolves have also taken a head-on approach. Both Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Okogie were part of a rally Stephen Jackson held in Minneapolis. Floyd was a friend of Jackson's for 20 years. “It just tells us that as a black whole that we're tired. We're tired of being treated like we're less than,” Okogie told The Athletic. “We're tired of being alienated. And also just to tell people that we're not going to normalize this. We're not going to feel desensitized to this and we're not going anywhere. I feel like this is very important letting people know that we belong here as well.” Meanwhile in Philadelphia, 76ers forward Tobias Harris took part in the Philadelphia protest of the death of Floyd. Harris was recorded on video by 6ABC during the march. While he was marching toward the Art Museum, Harris had teammate Mike Scott on Face Time.

The facility's most valuable trophies and artifacts were moved to a secure facility in case additional trouble breaks out amid nationwide unrest over the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded to police that he could not breathe as an officer kneeled on Floyd's neck. Kimberly Beaudin, the hall's chief executive officer, said the extensive glass facade of the nearly 95,000-square-foot building was shattered Friday night. Rioters also broke into the street-level gift shop, stole merchandise and left it “pretty trashed,” she added. But, other than some broken glass that fell into a large exhibition area shaped like a football field, the interior of the hall was not breached by the protesters. “All of it can repaired. All of it can be recovered. All of the merchandise can be replaced,” Beaudin told The Associated Press on Sunday. “We're very thankful.” Previously located in South Bend, the Hall of Fame opened a $68.5 million facility in Atlanta in 2014, taking a prime spot adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center and across the street from Centennial Olympic Park. It is part of a hub of downtown tourist attractions that also includes the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, CNN Center, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, and a giant Ferris wheel. That area became the epicenter of Atlanta's protests over Floyd's death. Thousands of people jammed the streets, clashing with police and damaging businesses. The Hall of Fame had been making plans to reopen after shutting down in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Beaudin said those plans likely will be pushed back because of the time needed to make repairs. “We had been working through scenario A and scenario B,” she said. “Now, we have scenario C.” More protests were staged Saturday in Atlanta, but no additional damage was reported to the Hall of Fame or other businesses around Centennial Olympic Park. The city was under a curfew and a heavy presence of police and National Guard soldiers curtailed a repeat of Friday night's carnage.

And it's not just in the U.S. – London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday that certainly violated government social distancing rules. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that's killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Violent protests over the death of George Floyd by police have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. City officials ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 in Minneapolis saying “I can't breathe” after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “Whether they're fired up or not, that doesn't prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen more than 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed.",0.0

Brake spoke by telephone Sunday from his Lutheran Hospital room and said he was standing in the street just off the curb on Clinton Street near the Allen County Courthouse as police officers in riot gear approached. He had been separated from two of his friends, who later tracked him through a phone app and discovered he was at Lutheran Hospital. Brake said two men carried him to a police car at the protest scene and begged an officer to call medics. Brake “saw (the canister) hit the ground after it hit him,” his mother, Rachel Simonis, said Sunday after after her son's early-morning surgery. She said doctors told her that there was “nothing left but the shell of his eye.” An ophthalmologist and plastic surgeon operated on Brake. Sofia Rosales-Scatena, public information officer for the Fort Wayne Police Department, issued a statement Sunday denying that an officer targeted Brake. “According to our officers on the ground, the protester was still in the area after commands to leave the area were given. Gas was deployed in the area and the protester bent over to pick up the canister to throw it back at officers as many others were trying to do. When he bent over, another canister was deployed in the area and that canister skipped and hit the protester in the eye. There was no deliberate deployment of gas to any persons head,” the statement read. Brake, a weekend editor at a local television station, and his mother heard a different story from his employer, who had reporters on scene. “The owner of (the station) called to see how things were going with Balin. When Balin was struck in the eye, he said a couple of his newscasters saw Balin get hit in the eye. Balin fell to the ground and they (police) left him laying on the ground and two men picked him up and took him to safety, towards the police, and a police officer called an ambulance. They just left him laying there in the street,” Simonis said. Brake said he made no attempt to pick up the canister and throw it back at police. “Absolutely not,” he said. “I was not wearing gloves. Those canisters are hot as hell. I would not try to pick them up with my bare hands. In fact, one of them hit my shoe and burned my laces off.” In a few weeks, Brake, a Northrop High School graduate who is studying communications with a concentration on journalism and broadcasting, will undergo another operation to repair facial fractures and be fitted for a prosthetic eye, Simonis said. A Facebook page labeled “Balin's medical fundraiser” was set up to help cover medical costs. Simonis said her son is a gentle person who went downtown to stand up for what he believes in. Brake said losing his eye was “small collateral for the battle we're fighting.” He said he believes white privilege is real and “if you're not going to use it to advocate for your fellow people, then that is just wrong.” In Brake's reckoning of the events, “police need policing,” and when police use tear gas, it should be aimed at the ground and “not at people's bodies and heads.” jduffy@jg.net",0.0
1621935398,2020-06-01 01:00:00,Majority of arrested from city,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/police-fire/20200601/majority-of-arrested-from-city,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"Two weekend protests in downtown Fort Wayne ended in arrests for almost 100 people, most of whom call the Summit City home, according to information police provided Sunday. The Friday and Saturday protests began peacefully but ended in police using measures including tear gas against the crowds, which interfered with traffic, vandalized downtown buildings and assaulted officers with rocks, bottles and other items, police said. The Fort Wayne Police Department provided the names, ages and towns of residence for 97 adults arrested in connection with the protests. Of those, 22 were from out of state or from other Indiana cities including New Haven, Bluffton, Warsaw, Kendallville and Indianapolis. Two juveniles also were arrested, police spokeswoman Sgt. Sofia Rosales-Scatena said by email Sunday. Mayor Tom Henry insisted in a news conference Saturday that the trouble came from elsewhere. “We stand behind our belief from the information that was presented to our office and law enforcement that there were groups of out of town individuals who were not protesting peacefully,” mayoral spokesman John Perlich said by email Sunday evening. More people from outside Fort Wayne were arrested Saturday compared to Friday, Perlich added. Six out-of-towners, including two from Michigan, were arrested Friday, and 16 non-city residents were arrested Saturday, according to police. Protesters spoke against police violence and, in particular, last week's death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. “Not everyone who was taking the protests to unsafe levels was able to be arrested due to the number of people in the crowds,” Perlich said. “We do recognize that the vast majority of residents arrested were from Fort Wayne. That's why we want to continue to have open dialogue to get a better sense for why some of the protests turned aggressive and violent.” The ages of those arrested ranged from 18 to 48. Rosales-Scatena did not provide detailed charges for each person but indicated most faced charges of disorderly conduct, rioting and/or failing to leave an emergency area. One officer was taken to a hospital with injuries that were non-life-threatening, Rosales-Scatena said in a statement about Saturday's protest. Injuries to protesters also were reported, she said. One person was injured when he bent to pick up a gas canister to throw it back at officers, like many were trying to do, she said. “When he bent over, another canister was deployed in the area and that canister skipped and hit the protester in the eye,” Rosales-Scatena said in a statement. “There was no deliberate deployment of gas to any person's head.” The city supports protests as a way for people to express their feelings and concerns, Perlich said, but officials want to ensure demonstrations are done peacefully. “We continue to mourn for the Floyd family and everyone who has been treated unjustly,” Perlich said. “It's critical to come together as a community united with a commitment to gaining a better understanding of the pain and hurt people are experiencing.” asloboda@jg.net",0.0
1621935395,2020-06-01 01:00:00,Day 3 features calmer tone,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20200601/day-3-features-calmer-tone,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"Rodney Rothgeb didn't come to the Allen County Courthouse lawn Sunday looking for trouble. The Fort Wayne man instead hoped his family's participation in the afternoon protest would leave his 5-year-old daughter, Sydney, with a memory of standing up for a cause. “We can't keep losing lives,” Rothgeb said, his daughter nearby. Sunday marked the third day protesters in Fort Wayne rallied against police violence and last week's death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. Previous protests began peacefully but ended in police using measures including tear gas against the crowds, which interfered with traffic, vandalized buildings and threw rocks and bottles at officers, police said. That did not happen Sunday, at least not before sunset. In fading sunlight, police officers and citizens talked in small groups near the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. bridge at Clinton and Fourth streets. “I'm so glad we've had the opportunity” to speak, one police officer said to those around him. He noted the atmosphere was different Saturday, when some protesters threw items at police. “That's a hard time to have a conversation,” the officer said. It appeared protesters came prepared for another day of tear gas. Some on the MLK bridge held jugs of milk and at least one man had a gas mask. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Sunday directed the Indiana National Guard to be on standby. He also verbally activated the Indiana National Guard Reactionary Force company to be available to help communities Saturday, but no deployment was requested. “Organized protests have taken place across the state without incident but the events that have followed, particularly in Indianapolis, have devastated businesses, defaced public monuments that are centuries old, and resulted in loss of life,” Holcomb said in a statement. Sunday, more than 100 people gathered along Clinton Street within the demonstration's first hour. Many clutched signs with messages including “Let Us Breathe,” “White Silence is Racism,” “Blue Lives Murder,” “Police Gas Peaceful Protests!!!!” and “Am I next?” Songs including the Black Eyed Peas' “Where is the Love?” and “This is America” by Childish Gambino provided a soundtrack. Protesters cheered as passing vehicles, including an ambulance, honked their support and as drivers raised fist and thumbs-ups through opened windows and sunroofs. They roared – and called out thanks – to drivers who delivered water and snacks. Those gestures of support illustrate that Fort Wayne has a community, protester Tee Cook said. Cook, a black woman with six black sons, attended the previous two protests and stressed that those who prompted police interference did not represent the protesters as a whole. “The majority of us just want some change,” she said. She noted she was best friends with DeMarcus Walker, the Fort Wayne man who was attacked with a baseball bat as he walked out of the Apple Glen Walmart in March and later died. His family believed it was racially motivated and called it a hate crime. The man accused of beating Walker is white; Walker was black. “It's deeper than police brutality,” Cook said when asked about her participation Sunday. At least twice Sunday, the protesters lay on the grass and sidewalk eight to nine minutes, the same length of time Floyd was pinned down by the officer. He could be heard in a video saying, “I Can't Breathe,” as he lay in the street nearly face down. Cook wanted to bring her 9-year-old but said was afraid what might transpire. “I'm hoping I don't get gassed today,” she said. As the protest – which went at least six hours – continued downtown, about 300 people gathered Sunday evening for a prayer walk for peace and justice nationally. The gathering, which started at the Imani Baptist Temple parking lot, 2920 Indiana Ave., included people from a wide range of churches. “At the end of the day, faith matters,” said the Rev. Bill McGill, pastor of Imani and one of the event's organizers. Fort Wayne resident David Mertz, a member of Pathway Community Church, said he was drawn to the event by the Holy Spirit, a desire to be more informed and “to pray for God to be more present in everyone's life.” His wife, Krishna, said it was an opportunity to “lead by praying” and let people know about God. “With Him, this can be healed, everybody can be healed,” she said as the couple waited to begin the short walk west to Lutheran Park, where the crowd would gather in a sprawling circle and hear from multiple people. “We're created in His image,” Krishna Mertz said. “We should love everybody.” Margaret Jordan, a member of Imani Baptist, said she had other obligations and could not make it downtown for the initial demonstrations. She didn't realize “it had taken a turn for the worse” until seeing the news. “I believe in the power of prayer,” Jordan said. Mary Cobbins, another member of Imani Baptist, agreed people need to come together and pray. “And if we're going to protest, it should be non-violent. It doesn't have to be like it was downtown, and I think the age difference has a lot to do with it,” she said, referencing the younger crowd that seemed to be most clashing with police. During the speaking portion at Lutheran Park, the Rev. Anne Epling, pastor of First Presbyterian Church, said, “George Floyd died a brutal death at the hands of police,” prompting the street protests that occurred nationwide over the weekend. She said while most people spent weeks not long ago “sheltering in place” to guard against the novel coronavirus, there's another disease that has an unfortunate 400-year history – racism. asloboda@jg.net Lisa Green of The Journal Gazette contributed to this story.",0.0

(WEHT) A peaceful rally in Evansville turned confrontational and now organizers are looking at what they can do differently moving forward. A change of plans during Saturday’s rally was to move to the Civic Center from the Four Freedoms Memorial, which rally organizer Ebon Ellis said was a decision made by the people. “I can’t take credit for that. The people encouraged me we had to go to the courthouse. We had to have our voices be heard. They are police brutality so we had to go there and let them hear the message,” Ebon Ellis said. After four hours of protesting in front of the police line, the two sides collided and four people were arrested. Despite the violence that came out of the event, Ebonique Ellis says she hopes people can continue to find the good in others and overcome division. “From everything that we did yesterday, I just think it’s really important that from everything we still come together and love and we don’t have to protest out of anger, we can still get together and do things out of love,” Ebonique Ellis said. Even 24 hours after the events of the rally yesterday, protesters continue to stand outside of the Civic Center. The remaining protesters say they will continue to fight for racial justice until change is made in the river city. The street in front of the Civic Center is blocked off with barricades, preventing oncoming traffic. As for Ebon Ellis, he says that he and other organizers are working to plan another peaceful rally in Evansville soon. “The protest never ends, even if you’re not marching. So with that, we’re still working, we’re still gaining momentum, this is only the beginning,” Ellis said.

1621957378,2020-05-31 13:31:31,Officials blame 'outsiders' for violence as Trump says Antifa to be labeled a terror group,https://www.wthr.com/article/officials-blame-outsiders-violence-trump-says-antifa-be-labeled-terror-group,en,False,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the ""outsiders"" -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country prepared over the weekend for another round of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels ""are trying to take advantage of the chaos."" John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. ""But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we've seen cells of white supremacists in the area,"" he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to ""far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was ""being led by Antifa and other radical groups."" Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump send out a tweet where he wrote simply, ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020  Attorney General William Barr has seemed to echo Trump's assertions, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that ""a number of different groups are involved in these whether it's Antifa or it's others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn't normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn't elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. Some observers believe a move to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization also carries with it some ulterior motives. Journalist Jeremy Scahill tweeted Sunday that Trump's announcement means a ramping up of domestic spying against protesters is on the horizon. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd's death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. ""We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,"" Craig told reporters. ""If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community."" Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he'd been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. ""I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,"" said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. ""It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard."" It's exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. ""The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can't rebuild then the only thing we've done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You're talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer."" Trump vowed Saturday that the ""radical left criminals, thugs and others"" would ""not be allowed to set communities ablaze."" ""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,"" he said. ""Won't happen."" ___ Hennessey reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Michael R.

Chiara de Blasio, 25, was taken into custody around 10:30 p.m. after cops declared an unlawful assembly at 12th Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan, the sources said. She had allegedly been blocking traffic on Broadway and was arrested after refusing to move, the source said.

There were thousands of people in that area at that time,” the source said. Chiara gave a residence on East End Avenue as her address — otherwise known as Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s Upper East Side home. But she didn’t tell cops she was the mayor’s daughter. The arrest came about an hour before Hizzoner told protesters it was time to “go home.” “We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but now it is time for people to go home,” de Blasio said at a press conference at 11:30 p.m. at the NYC Emergency Management headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn.

It is well organized, even though many of the people are associated with the anarchist movement,” de Blasio said in a City Hall press briefing of the outside opportunists he blamed for the now-nationwide demonstrations devolving into chaos. “Some come from outside of the cities.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) (AP) — Target and CVS are temporarily closing certain locations after some were damaged during weekend protests over the death of George Floyd. Target said it was closing 105 stores in 10 states, including 46 stores in California and 33 in Minnesota, where the company is based and where the protests over Floyd’s death began. Target is also closing some stores in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, Georgia, Oregon, Michigan and Texas. CVS didn’t say how many stores it had closed, but it said the shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for the company said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “Employee and customer safety is our top priority, so we are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Floyd, who was black and handcuffed, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The other three officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven’t been charged. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums they are earning due to the coronavirus pandemic. They will also be able to work at Target locations that remain open.",0.0

The 27-second video, which was posted to Twitter, shows an NYPD truck in front of a crowd throwing objects at the vehicle. There is a barricade in front of the truck. The truck then appears to drive into the barricade, knocking over protestors.Screaming and yelling are heard while a person is seen jumping on top of the truck. It’s unclear if there were any injuries. The incident further fuels the flames of negative interactions between police and the people they’re sworn to protect. A lot of the protests erupting in major cities across the US are the result of people’s anger boiling over after the death of Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the incident is under investigation, but emphasized that the officers may have had no other choice. “I’m not going to blame officers who were trying to deal with an absolutely impossible situation. The folks who were converging on that police car did the wrong thing to begin with, and they created an untenable situation,” he said. “I wish the officers had found a different approach, but let’s begin at the beginning. The protesters in that video did the wrong thing to surround that police car, period.” But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York slammed de Blasio’s comments as “unacceptable.” “As mayor, this police department is under your leadership,” she tweeted Sunday morning. “Defending and making excuses for NYPD running SUVs into crowds was wrong. Make it right. De-escalate.” The mayor emphasized late Saturday that he had spoken with community leaders and there is a possibility that there areprotesters who are intentionally trying to incite violence including those who have come to New York City from other places. “People who represent the communities of our city and the residents of our city are not joining negative and violent protests,” de Blasio said. CNN has reached out to the NYPD, and the offices of the New York governor and attorney general for comment. Earlier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had ordered the attorney general to independently review the events of Friday’s protests that included protesters clashing with police in Brooklyn and other boroughs.",0.0

1622006246,2020-05-31 19:21:45,More journalists injured covering George Floyd protests,https://www.wthr.com/article/more-journalists-injured-covering-george-floyd-protests-1,en,False,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP/WTHR) — The first time officers shot rubber bullets at MSNBC host Ali Velshi and his crew Saturday night in Minneapolis, he was willing to believe that the officials didn’t know they were press. The second time, Velshi said, they knew and shot anyway. “We put our hands up and yelled, ‘We’re media!’” Velshi said. “They responded, ‘We don’t care!’ and they opened fire a second time.” Velshi, who said he was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet, is just one of many journalists across the country who sustained injuries from police or protesters while covering the George Floyd protests this weekend. And this occurred after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with following the Friday arrest of a CNN crew on live television and other reports of violence against reporters from the city where Floyd died, including freelance photographer Linda Tirado, who said she is blind in her left eye after being shot at by police. NBC News' posted a photograph on Instagram of one of its photographers who was bloody after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd. ""NBC News' Ed Ou is seen bleeding after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets during a protest over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,"" the post says. Dan Shelley, the executive director and chief operating officer of the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), said while all the attacks on journalists were “outrageous and unacceptable"" that he was particularly upset about the Minneapolis incidents that happened after the Governor made his reassurances. “They started deliberately attacking journalists who were clearly identifiable and identifying themselves as journalists,” Shelley said. “We’ve heard a number of instances of police officers, either through their words or actions, saying that they just didn’t care. To be a journalist in the Twin Cities last night, particularly in Minneapolis, if you were just arrested, you were lucky.” Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter Chris Serres tweeted Sunday that he was twice ordered at gunpoint to hit the ground. Serres wrote that he was, “Warned that if I moved “an inch” I’d be shot. This after being teargassed and hit in groin area by rubber bullet. Waiving a Star Tribune press badge made no difference.” His Star Tribune colleague Ryan Faircloth’s car was also hit by what were “likely rubber bullets,” which shattered his window and left him with cuts on his arm and brow. Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessey-Fiske said in a video message on Twitter that she and about a dozen other press had identified themselves as such and that Minnesota State Patrol officers still “fired tear gun cannisters on us at point blank range.” Hennessey-Fiske said she got hit in the leg. She said she asked the officers where they should go but they didn't give the reporters any direction. “They just fired on us,"" she said. It wasn’t just Minneapolis where reporters found themselves in harm’s way. Saturday there were journalist injuries reported in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit and Denver. Although the situation is fluid and developing, the RTDNA has counted more than 60 incidents across the country in the past 48 hours in which reporters have been, “injured, assaulted or harassed by either protesters or police officers.” In Chicago, Vice reporter Michael Adams had a similar interaction to Velshi and Hennessey-Fiske when police raided the gas station he and his crew were sheltering at and said they “didn’t care” that they were press. “After shouting press multiple times and raising my press card in the air, I was thrown to the ground,” Adams wrote on Twitter. “Then another cop came up and peppered sprayed me in the face while I was being held down.” Huffington Post reporter Christopher Mathais was arrested Saturday while covering protests in New York. And in Denver, 9NEWS reporter Jeremy Jojola tweeted that he got hit with, “Something fired by police” even though he was holding a camera and lights. I just got hit with something fired by police who were standing at the Capitol. I was clearly with a photographer just after I went live with a large camera and light. Whatever they fired hit my backpack. — Jeremy Jojola (@jeremyjojola) May 31, 2020  Sunday, he reflected that he’ll, “Never truly know if we were intentionally targeted or not. I’ll just say we were not doing anything wrong as we were in an area under curfew.” Since the protests began, eight AP journalists have been hurt, though none seriously. Three have been hit by rubber bullets, one was punched, another was knocked down and others fell. The acts of violence and deliberate harassment are further distressing to Shelley because it’s distracting from the real story. “Journalists shouldn’t be the story,” Shelley said. “It is calamitous to see all of these journalists who are merely serving the public by covering these incidents of civil unrest being wantonly attacked...Journalists are representatives of the public and are there to serve the public and to tell the stories of the protesters and of the elected and other public officials trying to deal with the situation."" He added: “It is really harming the public at large, not just the journalist. It’s interfering with their ability to be eyewitnesses and chroniclers of what’s occurring in this country right now.” CNN commentator Keith Boykin was also arrested by the NYPD Saturday after he identified himself as press. In Los Angeles, Lexis-Olivier Ray said an LAPD officer hit him in the stomach after he’d identified himself as a journalist “multiple times.” In Washington D.C., Huffington Post reporter Philip Lewis tweeted that he was hit in the leg with rubber bullets. Detroit Free Press news director Jim Schaefer said several of their journalists showing their media badges were pepper-sprayed by Detroit police.",0.0

He was there for a little under an hour, according to CNN. Demonstrators gathered on Friday and Saturday nights at Lafayette Square outside the White House to protest police brutality. The gatherings, which began as peaceful demonstrations during the day, gave way to violence at night. Uniformed Secret Service officers made six arrests Friday night after ""Justice for George Floyd"" protests. A total of 11 Secret Service officers were taken to hospitals in the D.C. area, according to officials. With 60 uniformed officers protecting the area around the White House, the Secret Service said its officers were kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids. Bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items were also reportedly thrown at the Secret Service, who with U.S. Park Police, held the area by using riot gear, pepper spray and rubber bullets to deter violent riots that ensued after peaceful protests. ""Demonstrators repeatedly attempted to knock over security barriers on Pennsylvania Avenue,"" a Secret Service statement said. ""Some of the demonstrators were violent, assaulting Secret Service Officer and Special Agents with bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items. Multiple Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers and Special Agents suffered injuries from this violence. The Secret Service respects the right to assemble, and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all."" No one crossed the White House Fence and no Secret Service members were ever in danger, according to the agency. President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to express his thanks to Secret Service for their handling of the crowds outside the White House. ""Great job last night at the White House by the U.S. @SecretService,"" the Tweet said. ""They were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn’t have felt more safe.

1622006226,2020-06-01 00:32:43,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.wthr.com/article/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-protests,en,False,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. ""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. ""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues."" There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. (Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

1622006219,2020-06-01 00:56:48,World alarmed by violence in US; thousands march in London,https://www.wthr.com/article/world-alarmed-violence-us-thousands-march-london,en,True,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"LONDON, UK (AP) — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America's closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words ""How many more?"" at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as ""Stop Killing Black People."" The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital's Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like ""Silence is Violence,"" ""Hold Cops Accountable,"" and ""Who Do You Call When Police Murder?"" No incidents were reported. Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline ""This killer-cop set America ablaze"" with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death, with his knee on Floyd's neck. The newspaper's story reported ""scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd's killing was ""different"" than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. ""There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,"" Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor's warning that ""anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials' criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: ""I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?"" Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting ""I can't breathe,"" which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed ""a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters."" Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of ""setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,"" without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of ""systemic problems in the human rights sphere.'' It denounced Floyd's death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. ""This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.'' There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio's working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called ""Black lives matter,"" was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. ""I can't breathe"", said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That's a play on the slogan for Lebanon's protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. (Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

LOUIS — Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy’s store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd’s death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy’s flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama’s largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work. Live video showed workers attaching straps to the peak of the obelisk so it could be lifted away with a crane. Within a few hours they had removed the top of the monument. Woodfin said the city would see if the memorial could be given to a museum or another group. Woodfin said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. ___ CICERO, Ill. — Two people have been killed during unrest in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania says 60 people were arrested in the town of about 84,000 located west of Chicago. Hanania didn’t provide additional information about those killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff’s Office were called in to help local police Monday as people broke into a liquor store and other businesses and stole items. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a George Floyd demonstration Monday night in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Video from the scene shows the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackle a protester on the street and handcuff him. Officers are seen scattering to avoid the SUV as it drives off on Buffalo’s east side. Apparent gunshots are heard. The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said they were in stable condition. ___ WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officers used tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters to turn back demonstrators in Washington protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters remained on the streets well past the 7 p.m. curfew that had been imposed by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. They had spent hours marching peacefully around the nation’s capital before they were buzzed by the helicopters, which kicked up debris. A standoff developed within site of the Capitol. Protesters smashed windows at the Teamsters building as they dispersed. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from Louisville’s downtown Jefferson Square, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. Riot police with batons at the ready stood shoulder to shoulder as they advanced down key streets before breaking up the protest after a brief standoff shortly after 10 p.m. Demonstrators shouted at police as authorities on a microphone ordered the crowd to disperse before loud bursts of tear gas crackled and spread acrid, choking smoke over the area. Protesters began running and military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the key square fronting a courthouse complex. Some protesters gasped and held wet cloths to their faces as they ran from the wafting gas and advancing police. A helicopter clattered overhead amid the bursts of tear gas fire, and streets appeared to largely empty out. ___ Tiger Woods is speaking out for the first time since George Floyd’s death, saying his heart goes out to Floyd, his family and everyone who is hurting right now. The golfer says he has always had the “utmost respect for our law enforcement,” but Floyd’s death crossed a line. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. Referencing the protests in his statement, Woods says, “We can make our points without burning the very neighborhoods we live in.” ___ ATLANTA — Protesters were still in the streets of downtown Atlanta on Monday night as curfew neared, and police officers and the National Guard used tear gas, starting shortly before 9 p.m. Protesters largely dispersed after that, though some remained, and officers were making arrests, apparently for curfew violations. A similar scene played out the night before. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The fatal shooting of the popular owner of a Louisville barbecue spot has prompted a massive march to the site where the restaurateur was killed early Monday. David McAtee died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests in the Kentucky city. Mayor Greg Fischer revealed earlier Monday that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation. The large group marched peacefully Monday evening as some honked horns in solidarity and marchers raised clenched fists. Louisville’s police chief was fired by the city’s mayor on Monday after the mayor learned that officers failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene were McAttee was shot. ___ NASHVILLE, Tenn. — More than 60 National Guard troops put down their riot shields Monday evening at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol in Nashville to honor George Floyd. Guardsman had initially rushed to grab their shields and form a hard line to block the slowly moving crowd — which was singing and chanting — from advancing up the Capitol steps. As the National Guard began moving, Tennessee State Police grabbed batons and formed a line behind them. However, the crowd remained calm. Democratic lawmakers leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd. As the crowd continued to sing and call for justice for black Americans, slowly the shields began to drop. The state troopers declined to drop their batons but backed farther away from the crowd. Monday’s peaceful vigil was a marked difference from several protests that turned violent in Tennessee over the weekend. ___ At least 5,600 people have been arrested in cities around the country since demonstrations broke out protesting the death of George Floyd, according to a tally compiled by AP journalists from police department press releases, police agency Twitter activity and media reports. The protests began after the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The arrests come as protests in some cities become more violent and as police and governors are urged by President Donald Trump to take a stronger hand in quelling the demonstrations. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, some 155 arrests have taken place. Some of the biggest cities in the U.S. have made a significant number of arrests, including nearly 800 in New York City and more than 900 in Los Angeles. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters took a knee in the middle of a downtown Washington street Monday night, chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” They applauded as they rose to their feet and declared that the streets were theirs. Over the past few nights, demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota had asked black police officers to take a knee to show their support. The march Monday night was peaceful as nightfall approached. There was no apparent effort to get protesters off the streets even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. Earlier, law enforcement officers on horseback and foot aggressively pushed the protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House so President Donald Trump could visit a church that was damaged by fire during the protests Sunday night. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters marched on the National Mall and D.C. streets after being driven from the White House by law enforcement officers on horseback and foot so President Donald Trump could visit St. John’s Church, which was damaged during the demonstrations Sunday night. The demonstrators passed the Lincoln and World War II Memorials and the Washington Monument on the Mall before heading back to the streets near the White House. There was no apparent attempt to disburse the protesters even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. At Farragut Square, a few blocks from the White House, there were about two law enforcement officers for every civilian. Multiple helicopters buzzed overhead, a relative rarity in the District of Columbia, which is normally a no-fly zone for helicopters and drones. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Heavy equipment arrived Monday night at the Birmingham park where protesters tried but failed to topple a more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone Sunday. It could be the first step toward removing the obelisk. Mayor Randall Woodfin has vowed to remove the monument, which was at the center of a court fight between the city and state over an Alabama law protecting rebel memorials. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday evening slammed President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. In an emailed statement in response to the president’s comments, the Democrat said Trump “has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office.” “He cowers at the feet of authoritarians around the world,” Inslee said. “Now he uses the most supreme power of the presidency in a desperate attempt to hide his timidity and vapidity. I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” The Seattle area has seen several days of violence, including vandalism in the city’s downtown core. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that “is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a Monday news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations. Trump spoke to governors via video teleconference. Brown said having National Guard soldiers on the streets was the wrong way to go. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. “Trump wants governors to deploy the national guard to intimidate the public.” Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. nightly. Police arrested 11 adults during protests Sunday and early Monday morning after authorities said projectiles — including “large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks” — were thrown at officers. “Having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants,” Brown said. ___ Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay for George Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, and the family has accepted the offer. Mayweather personally has been in touch with the family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. He will handle costs for the funeral on June 9 in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, as well as other expenses. TMZ originally reported Mayweather’s offer. “He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, he is definitely paying for the funeral,” Ellerbe told ESPN.com on Monday. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is visiting the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire as demonstrators clashed with police over the weekend. Beginning with James Madison, every person who has held the office of president has attended a service at St. John’s Church. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. Trump is urging the nation’s governors to get tougher with violent protesters and to deploy the National Guard. He said in the Rose Garden that he is an ally of peaceful protesters, but he stressed that “I am your president of law and order.” ___ PHILADELPHIA — Police fired non-lethal bullets and tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia on Monday just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. The crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs across the Delaware River. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted. More than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to block the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from downtown the city’s imposing art museum.",0.0

(Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) (CNN) — Government leaders and health officials have expressed their concern that coronavirus could rapidly spread during protests over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died after since-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for over eight minutes. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. People across the country have taken to the streets to vent their frustrations over the seeming lack of value for the lives of black men. It was the same week the nation crossed the 100,000 death count from coronavirus. Sunday alone saw an increase of almost 20,000 cases, according to the CNN count compiled with data from John’s Hopkins. As of Monday morning at least 1,790,191 Americans have contracted the virus and 104,383 have died. But some expect a jump in cases following days of demonstrations. With large groups of people out in hoards close together during the protests, Minnesota Governor Walz said he expects a sharp increase in cases of Covid-19 in his state “I am deeply concerned about a super-spreader type of incident,” Walz said. “We’re going to see a spike in Covid-19. It’s inevitable.” Officials in New York shared the governor’s worry about a potential for rise in coronavirus among protesters. “I would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather it’s inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic, and I’m going to keep urging people not to use that approach and if they do they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday. The mayor said he recognized the need to demonstrate following the death of Floyd but “It’s a very, very complicated reality.” “You cannot see overt racism, you cannot see overt racist murder and not feel something profoundly deep, so I understand that,” de Blasio added. “But the last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings.” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that while people have the right to protest, even during a pandemic, they also have a duty to protect the health of themselves and others. “You have a right to demonstrate you have a right to protest, God Bless America,” Cuomo said at a Saturday press conference. “You don’t have a right to infect other people, you don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” “Demonstrate with a mask on,” he said nodding to its effectiveness. “You’re wrong not to wear a mask, I think you’re disrespectful, I think you’re putting other people’s lives at risk needlessly.” Cuomo also noted how the coronavirus has brought long standing health disparities for the African American community to light once again. “The coronavirus crisis has created a depth of pain that still has not been accounted for. So many New Yorkers have lost someone but that is particularly true in communities of color and particularly true in the African American community,” Cuomo said. “That loss is being felt so deeply because every knows it’s not based on equality … communities of color lost so much more.” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said she’s worried about the impact the virus is having on the community during the protests. She told CNN she’s been so busy with ongoing unrest in her city that she neglected to look at infection data for days. “Last night I realized I hadn’t looked at our coronavirus numbers in two days,” Lance Bottoms told CNN’s Jake Tapper during State of the Union. “That’s frightening because it’s a pandemic and people of color are getting hit harder.” “I am extremely concerned when we’re seeing mass gatherings. We know what’s happening in our community with this virus,” the mayor explained. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan shared a similar sentiment saying the priority has been to keep people safe during the demonstrations but the focus has to also include the months long fight against the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to Jake Tapper on State of the Union, Hogan said he, too, is concerned about the coronavirus amidst the fallout from the death of Floyd. “There’s no questions that when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity when we’ve got this virus all over the streets is not healthy,” Hogan said. “Two weeks from now across America we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up.” “Most states had rules about no crowds of ten or more and now we’re seeing thousands of people jammed in together in close proximity,” Hogan added. Health experts have also spoken out about the need for masks and other protective measures in light of racial disparities in the data showing minorities have an increased risk for catching the virus. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration under President Donald Trump, said during CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday that these demonstrations will create further spread of Covid-19, especially in a state that was trending upward before this week’s events. “There’s going to be a lot of issues coming out of what’s happened in the last week, but one of them is going to be that chains of transmission will have become lit from these gatherings,” Gottlieb said. “And Minnesota, one of the hard hit states by the protests where you’ve seen large mass gatherings, that state has been seeing an uptick in cases to begin with. Even before these protests started, we saw rising hospitalizations in that state.” Other doctors told CNN that the racial disparity in the way coronavirus spreads will only be compounded by the protests. “I think this week, more than any week, it is so important to call attention to the racial disparities that many of us in the public health community, John, have been talking about for months,” Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and researcher at Brown University, told CNN’s John King. “We know that blacks are two to four times more likely to die from Covid-19 compared to whites. And of course, other communities, like Native Americans and Hispanics, are disproportionately affected, as well. “It’s so tied up with our country’s history of structural racism, historical injustices, as well as ongoing problems,” Dr. Ranny noted. Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, said on the same show that he wished demonstrators would wear masks to protect themselves and others.",0.0

(Photo by Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for the Celebration of Black Cinema) (CNN) — Actor Kendrick Sampson said he was shot seven times with rubber bullets by police in Los Angeles on Saturday during a protest over the death of George Floyd. “He pointed the gun DIRECTLY AT ME,” Sampson wrote on Twitter, linking to an news report about his experience. “I actually got hit 7 times with rubber bullets and many with batons. My boy has stitches.” Sampson, a vocal activist, was among thousands of people across the US who protested Floyd’s death this weekend. Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last week at the hands of police. Four officers were involved in the incident and all have since been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. One former officer, Derek Chauvin, is seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes. He was charged with with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Protesters say they want to see charges for all four police officers involved in the death of Floyd. Video of the event Sampson described was posted to Twitter by a friend of Sampson. The actor reshared the video to his own social media. The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. “If LAPD didn’t know cameras were on they would’ve done much WORSE,” Sampson wrote on Twitter about the incident. “They’re organized crime, continuing the legacy of slave catching.” Sampson said he went to the emergency room after the incident for his injuries, photos of which he also posted on Instagram. Sunday marked the sixth day of protests. Though many of the nationwide protests began peacefully, some turned violent. At least 40 cities have imposed curfews and National Guard members have been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC.",0.0

Amid this civil unrest, celebrities have used their platforms to educate, raise awareness, and demand change. Oprah: “Those of us who have the ability to be seen or heard in our lives—whether you are Black or white, Asian or Hispanic—it is incumbent on all of us to not just be outraged when we see injustice. It’s not enough to just say ‘It’s so terrible.’ We can’t tolerate hate crimes perpetrated by authorities in this country. We need to speak up and say ‘That will not happen on my watch.’ We’re going to do the work that it takes to dismantle in our own way.” Reese Witherspoon: The actress tweeted, “It was as hard for me to reconcile the difference between what I was taught in church and what I see in the world. I don’t want that for my kids. Or for yours.We have to be held accountable for what is happening in this country. What happened to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery – and countless others – can not go without justice.” We have to be held accountable for what is happening in this country. What happened to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery – and countless others – can not go without justice. — Reese Witherspoon (@ReeseW) May 30, 2020 Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson: “Past few days I’ve been stunned trying make sense of George Floyd’s death. The video. The plea for breath. The callous response. The racism. The killing. This is our ongoing disease. I’ve had cops in my family. Good men. And there’s a cop code, granting you the authority to use force if your life is in danger. But when a man is handcuffed, on the ground, no longer a threat… These officers will be charged, I’m positive of that. Held accountable. But then where’s the greater accountability? The leadership to healing. More importantly, the leadership to EQUALITY. We ultimately win when we can normalize equality…” Jennifer Aniston: She expressed on Instagram, “This week has been heartbreaking for so many reasons. We need to acknowledge that the racism and brutality in this country has been going on for a long time – and it’s NEVER been okay. As allies, who want equality and peace, it’s our responsibility to make noise, to demand justice, to educate ourselves on these issues, and more than anything, to spread love. How much more time are we willing to let pass without change? HOW MUCH MORE TIME?” Kevin Hart: “You can’t ask for peace if your not willing to give JUSTICE….people want JUSTICE. It’s that simple….Throw all of those cops in jail NOOOOOWWW. That’s taking action….Point blank!!!! This is what we want to see…..JUSTICE.” You can’t ask for peace if your not willing to give JUSTICE….people want JUSTICE. It’s that simple….Throw all of those cops in jail NOOOOOWWW. That’s taking action….Point blank!!!! This is what we want to see…..JUSTICE. — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) May 31, 2020 Jessica Biel: “The past few weeks have been heartbreaking… mostly because the racism and blatant injustices we’ve seen lately have happened many times before. We have allowed inequality to be part of America for too long – and it has NEVER been acceptable. As allies, we have to do more. While the obvious and understandable reaction is to be angry, and to fight back with hate – we also need to remember we are most powerful together. Please speak up. We want EVERYONE to live freely and peacefully. This hatred we are seeing is a result of a deep systemic problem, but we are not powerless.” Chrissy Teigen: After pledging $200,000 to bail out protestors, she wrote, “I stand with our heroes out there in support and solidarity… Silence is betrayal.” Katie Holmes: Alongside a quote of Floyd’s last words the actress quoted James Baldwin: “It is certain, in any case, that ignorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have,” and added, “I send love to his family and friends. This is heartbreaking.” Viola Davis: “This is what it means to be Black in America. Tried. Convicted. Killed for being Black. We are dictated by hundreds of years of policies that have restricted our very existence and still have to continue to face modern day lynchings. Here’s the thing……America will never be great until we can figure out a way for it to work for EVERYBODY!!! “I define connection as the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard and valued”……. RIP George Floyd.” Lebron James: Next to a side by side photo of Colin Kaepernick kneeling and Floyd being pinned down by a police officer’s knee, the NBA star explained, “Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you??” Steph Curry: “If this image doesn’t disturb you and piss you off, then idk. I’ve seen a lot of people speak up and try to articulate how fed up and angry they are. All good and well but it’s the same same same reality we live in. George Floyd. George Floyd. George has a family. George didn’t deserve to die. George pleaded for help and was just straight up ignored, which speaks loud and clear that his black life didn’t matter. George was murdered. George wasn’t human to that cop that slowly and purposefully took his life away.” Ava DuVernay: “You deserved your breath, your dignity, your life. Not to die in the street, murdered by a white cop’s knee on your neck. You deserve our tears, our prayers, our rage, our action.

Kim Kardashian: “For years, with every horrific murder of an innocent black man, woman, or child, I have always tried to find the right words to express my condolences and outrage, but the privilege I am afforded by the color of my skin has often left me feeling like this is not a fight that I can truly take on my own.

The National Guard has been activated in Washington, D.C., and 17 states: Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Utah, North Dakota, California, Missouri, Virginia, Kansas, Illinois and Nevada. In the wake of Floyd’s death, murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the day Monday. Please check back for updates: 3:01 a.m.: Seven police officers hospitalized in Boston, 40 people arrested As of 3:00 a.m. this morning, the Boston Police Department has confirmed that seven injured officers have been transported to the hospital with many more treated on scene. A total of 21 police cruisers have been damaged and about 40 individuals placed under arrest during the protest. The situation remains active and the numbers are subject to change, according to the BPD. 2:22 a.m.: Derek Chauvin moved to state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell has confirmed that Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of killing George Floyd, is now in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota. Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchison made the request to move him over concerns about the large number of people who could possibly be booked into Hennepin County Jail tonight and concerns over COVID-19. Chauvin’s court date has also been pushed back a week to next Monday, June 8 at 2:30 p.m. local time. 1:40 a.m.: In several cities, protesters and police share a hug Although Sunday’s protests included much of the looting and violence of the previous week’s demonstrations, there were signs throughout the country that relations between protesters and police were warming. In Orlando, Florida, photos on social media showed two police officers holding hands with protesters through a barricade. A video on Twitter showed a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in Miami detach himself from a security line to offer a hug to a woman sitting on a motor scooter, who said, “I appreciate your patience” after troopers remained calm when protesters approached them. Elsewhere in Miami, video showed a group of protesters shattering the glass door of a CVS as they prepared to loot the store — only to be stopped by a group of peaceful protesters who formed a line to prevent them from entering until the police arrived and dispersed the crowd. In New York City’s Foley Square, a cheer went up among protesters when a group of NYPD officers took a knee in a show of solidarity. In Oklahoma City, cameras also captured sheriff’s deputies taking a knee, with some hugging protesters near the Oklahoma County Jail. And in Flint, Michigan, video showed Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson telling a crowd of protesters that he’d ordered his deputies to lower their batons and that he wanted to make the event “a parade, not a protest.” The crowd then applauded the sheriff and invited him to join the march. 1:12 a.m.: Entire Washington, D.C. National Guard now activated The entire Washington, D.C. National Guard has been activated by Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to assist U.S. Park Police in the city, says Master Sergeant Craig Clapper, a spokesman for the DC National Guard. Clapper says the additional forces will be unarmed and in a support role to U.S. Park police and that they will be equipped in protective riot gear. Last night, elements of the D.C. National Guard were sent to Lafayette Park in front of the White House and to other landmarks on the National Mall. The Army Secretary is in charge of the D.C. National Guard because it is the nation’s only federalized National Guard since it is not run by a state governor due to the fact that the district is not a state. Clapper would not disclose the number of additional guardsmen that would be activated. The size of the entire D.C. National Guard is 3,400 personnel. 12:41 a.m.: Clashes continue in some cities, while others are more calm Arrests during Sunday’s protests have driven the total number of demonstrator arrests to more than 4,000 since protests began early in the week, according to reports. Confrontations between police and protesters continued for another night in Brooklyn, New York, where demonstrators clashed with officers outside Barclay’s Center. In Boston, an SUV drove through a crowd of protesters but officials said no one appeared to be seriously hurt. In Washington, D.C., members of the U.S. Marshals Service and DEA agents were called in to assist National Guard troops responding to protests near the White House, a Department of Justice official said. In Atlanta, two police officers were fired for using excessive force during an arrest of two college students during Saturday night’s protests. Video of the incident appeared to show officers Tase the two students as they sat in their vehicle, and then forcefully drag them out of the car. Protests in other cities, however, remained largely peaceful Sunday. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said protesters were “largely cooperative” in his state. Large crowds surrounded the State Capitol in Denver but stayed calm, according to reports. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

The president on Friday tweeted a message suggesting protesters in Minneapolis could be shot if the demonstrations devolved into looting, which Twitter annotated with a warning that the message glorified violence. He later tweeted that the Secret Service was ready to respond to protesters gathered outside the White House on Friday with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons.” Stephanopoulos pressed the speaker about the president’s tweets, noting that he has criticized mayors for their response to the protests and blamed antifa and the radical left for encouraging violence. “You ignore him, but at the same time, he’s been continuing to tweet and speak out. Today, he’s attacking the protesters saying it’s part of the far left. He’s attacking the mayors of Minneapolis and the mayor of Washington, D.C.,” Stephanopoulos said. “What should the president of the United States be doing right now?” “He should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along,” Pelosi said, adding that Trump’s predecessors brought Americans together during times of unrest, and did not “fuel the flame.” When asked whether the arrest of a single officer for third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter is sufficient for justice to be served in response to Floyd’s death, Pelosi said she has concerns about whether the charges are severe enough. “I said right from the start that it was murder. We saw an execution of a person on TV,” she said. “There are others there who witnessed it, who were — would be considered, in other circumstances, accomplices to it,” Pelosi added. “I have my own concern about a murder-three charge.” Americans, Pelosi said, “should be very prayerful about how we can come together to meet the challenges that we face, as our hearts are broken over losing 100,000 Americans — more than that — to the coronavirus tragedy.” “Let’s be prayerful, especially on a Sunday morning, about how we can put our differences aside, because this is the greatest country in the world, and we want to live up to the legacy of America,” she continued. Asked how the House would respond to Floyd’s death, Pelosi pointed to a new resolution condemning police brutality and racial profiling that calls for policing reforms at the local, state and federal levels authored by Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass, D-Calif. She also referenced a measure from Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., that would establish a commission to conduct a “systematic study of the conditions affecting black men and boys.” A proposal to ban police chokeholds, first introduced by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in 2015, has not moved in the House since Democrats took control of the chamber, but could be considered by the House Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks. As protests over Floyd’s murder continue across the country, Pelosi noted that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is also “taking undue tolls among people of color.” “This is happening at a time of other injustices,” she said. Negotiations between the House and Senate over the next round of coronavirus response funding and economic relief are at a standstill, after Democrats passed a $3 trillion measure earlier this month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Friday that the Senate would begin reviewing proposals in “about a month.” “Senator McConnell says we need a pause. Well, the virus isn’t taking a pause, the hunger in America isn’t taking a pause,” Pelosi said. “But they’ve changed their tune, they’re getting closer to (saying) uncle.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

Ahead of Friday evening protest Bloomington Police Chief Diekoff issued the following statement in regards to the Floyd case. “The death of George Floyd is deeply disturbing and I want to express my sympathy to Mr. Floyd’s family and community. This tragedy was absolutely unnecessary. Law enforcement officers are trained to treat all people with dignity and respect. These officers’ actions are inconsistent with the training of our profession. The Bloomington Police Department works continuously to build trust and understanding between our agency and the community we serve. The actions of the officers in Minneapolis are a reminder of how quickly that trust can be destroyed. All law enforcement must do a better job of holding ourselves accountable and to the highest ethical standards. The Bloomington Police Department instituted the recommendations from President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Six years ago we were one of the first agencies in the State to institute body-worn cameras for our officers. Those cameras come on when an officer is interacting with a member of the public, providing transparency with each interaction. Constant training is conducted throughout our department on topics like de-escalation skills, implicit bias, crisis intervention, and mental health first aid. Officers receive 4 and a half times the State mandated training hours. Fourteen data sets are regularly released on the Cities B-Clear portal and to the Police Data Initiative as a means of transparency for the public to see what we do. Bloomington Police Officers work every day to serve and help our community. We hold ourselves to a high standard of professionalism and will continue to earn the trust of the people we serve.” There were no damage reports to businesses or property during the protest on Friday in downtown Bloomington. Most protestors stayed on city streets and sidewalks. Another protest is being organized for this Friday by the Indiana University Black Student Union.",0.0

Police said those arrests occurred shortly before officers deployed gas canisters in the area. Barker said one officer had minor injuries. Fire officials also confirmed a small fire occurred at a bank building, but the Star reported that some protesters tried to extinguish the flames. Much like Friday, Saturday’s demonstration began peacefully but turned violent as the sun began to set. Police Chief Randal Taylor said that on Friday, at least 30 businesses were damaged and 27 people were arrested during demonstrations that continued through at least 4 a.m. The violence in Indianapolis and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement earlier Saturday that he, like many people, “was horrified by the needless killing of George Floyd,” but urged protesters to refrain from violence. “I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,” Hogsett said. “But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love.”",0.0

Demonstrations that started in Minnesota in the wake of Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, have multiplied as well as escalated from peaceful to violent and police chiefs from departments of all different sizes told ABC News that they have had to rely on their training procedures to get through each wave. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said that her agency is focused on making sure that people can express themselves freely and without any reservations. “Part of it is making sure that we have the right training that we are able to approach this in a way that minimizes risk to the people who are, exercising their free speech but also minimizes risk to officers,” Best explained to ABC News by phone. “Responding to civil disturbances like we have seen is always a complex and difficult situation for any police agency,” Steve Casstevens, the president of the International Chiefs of Police told ABC News. “It is easy to see the difficulties that situations like these present and the complexity of law enforcement’s action in response — which require a fine balance of response to the range of emotions and reactions — while working to restore peace and prevent the further escalation of violence and destruction of property.” Friday night in Oakland, California, one contracted Federal Protective Service (FPS) officer was shot and killed and another was wounded after a shooter opened fire on the federal building, the FBI told ABC News in a statement. A senior Department of Homeland Security official told ABC News that the shooting and the overnight protests were related, but the investigation is still in its preliminary stages. On Saturday night, outside the White House, the Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Secret Service made 18 arrests. According to MPD, 11 officers were injured, with one sustaining a compound leg fracture. More than 60 U.S. Secret Service uniformed division officers and special agents were injured during protests in Washington Friday night through Sunday morning. Eleven Secret Service employees were transported to local hospitals and treated for non-life threatening injuries during that period. In Seattle, the police chief said in a statement that 27 people were arrested Saturday night during demonstrations in the downtown area. That same night in Miami, authorities said there were 44 arrests during protests. Miami Chief Jorge Colina told ABC News that when the police department expects a lot of people, they don’t immediately go out in riot gear but rather wait and asses the situation. “If I can avoid a confrontation, I want to avoid it. Obviously, you’ve got to protect property. You’ve got to protect life. And I understand that. But I can’t stress enough how important it is to have those relationships built in where either the chief, or your community relations people can speak to the organizers, the unofficial leaders of those movements and say, hey, man, you too can be heard,” Colina told ABC News. Chief Edwin Roessler of Fairfax County, Virginia, stressed to ABC News that he also works with the community to quell tensions and provide support. “It comes down to having robust relationships with community advocates, regardless of their position. And we can’t as police chiefs and police departments exclude anybody’s opinion or use off-duty bias or implicit bias,” Roessler said. “We need to be aware, we need to work with everyone so if someone wants to exercise their first amendment rights in Fairfax County our goal is to work with that group, provide them a space and a place to do it.” Roessler said that his department is always actively engaging with community leaders to better improve relations — something that started when he first arrived as chief in 2013 because the police department was facing a challenge with transparency. “We know our advocates who helped us design the policy,” he said, “and we get to continually do that with each policy on an annual basis — have a transparent report card on our web site.” While “pop-up protests” don’t provide time to plan for a large-scale demonstration, Roessler said there is a specific civil disturbance unit in Fairfax County, that trains for these types of incidents. “Sometimes you’ve got to use discretion. Just because they’re blocking the road doesn’t mean that you necessarily have to go lock everybody up. There’s options, we could divert traffic and let the protest evaporate once (protesters) are satisfied,” he said. “You don’t necessarily need to arrest your way out of that.” On Friday morning, Americans woke to the news that a CNN reporter was arrested on live TV, and the police chiefs who ABC News spoke with said that while they did not want to judge without having been in the situation, they expressed frustration. “I’m sure that if you were to ask anyone in the Minneapolis Police Department, who has any rank, I can’t imagine that anyone there was happy with the decision that was made by whoever was in charge in the field. And I hope that it wasn’t even that. I hope it was just that officer who made that decision — a bad one — and not a decision from the leadership,” Colina said. Roessler said that as soon as he saw that video of the reporter getting arrested, he talked to his command staff to ensure that a situation like that doesn’t happen in Fairfax County. “When I observed that immediately to my civil disturbance unit commander, that we need to make sure this doesn’t happen to us, (Rossler urged the unit commander to) look at our policies, look at our training syllabus and make sure this is in the next level of training,” he explained. Best said that her department learned from instances like the 1999 protests of the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle. “We learned a lot of lessons then, which really was a milestone for our organization, in learning how to address some of these more volatile protests. We took a beating at that time in 1999. We have learned a lot of lessons since then about how to structure better,” Best explained. In a recorded message to Miami police officers, Colina called the video of Floyd’s death “disturbing” and he told ABC News that it sets police back. “It puts us back as a profession, decades. And quite frankly, it’s embarrassing as a nation,” he said. In Seattle, Best said that their goal during the protests is looking out for the safety of everyone. “On a human level we really want everyone to be safe, and I realize that people are very upset about the obvious indifference to human life that we saw, most recently, in Minneapolis, but generally speaking, the officers that come to work every day are just men and women trying to do the right thing and trying to do good work,” Best said.

The police killing of George Floyd and the civil and political unrest that’s rocked the nation in the week since has the potential to reshape Joe Biden’s vice-presidential selection process. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. “A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,” she said. “But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward.” Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Floyd, who after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. (Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the U.S. in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people. “To the American people, the world has … heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran. So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere. Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, … not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jill Lawless in London, Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Colleen Berry in Milan contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

On Saturday and Sunday, crowds gathered outside the U.S. embassies in London and Berlin to protest against the death of Floyd and show solidarity with the protests in the U.S. with chants of “I Can’t Breathe” a regular feature of the weekend demonstrations. In London, hundreds took part in a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration beginning with protesters taking a knee for nine minutes in Trafalgar Square before marching onto the U.S. Embassy. “Well, we’ve seen for hundreds of years black people and people of color be absolutely abused and killed on the streets and it’s just getting worse and worse,” one London protester said. “We’ve had enough, and if they’re not going to listen we’re just going to scream louder and louder.” London’s Metropolitan Police announced they arrested 23 people for “various offenses” across the U.K. capital on Sunday, and said they were on hand to make sure crowds complied with social distancing regulations. Two black soccer players in Germany referenced the protests after scoring goals in weekend games. Jadon Sancho, an English player for Borussia Dortmund, wore a shirt underneath his jersey saying “Justice for George Floyd.” Marcus Thuram took a knee after scoring a goal for Borussia Mönchengladbach in tribute to the U.S. protests. In Canada, thousands took to the streets in Vancouver and Montreal, echoing the chants heard across the U.S. in mostly peaceful protests Sunday. In the Montreal gathering, crowds were dispersed after projectiles were thrown at police later in the evening. And in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, crowds chanting “I Can’t Breathe” were dispersed by police in riot gear outside the state government palace on Sunday as anti-government protests against police brutality in Brazil fed off the global sentiment felt by the killing of Floyd. Last year in Rio, up to 1,402 people between January and September were killed by police, particularly in operations in the favelas, according to Human Rights Watch. In Iran and China, two countries in which the U.S. has been heavily critical of human rights abuses, state run media and foreign ministers criticised the American handling of the George Floyd protests. Manslaughter charges have been brought against Derek Chauvin, the white police officer accusing of kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nine minutes, and the National Guard has been activated in Minneapolis and 17 states.

1622270510,2020-06-01 09:00:04,Deadly police raid fuels call to end 'no knock' warrants,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200601/deadly-police-raid-fuels-call-to-end-no-knock-warrants,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. – It’s the stuff of nightmares: Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door. Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor's family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville's police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. “These changes, and more to come ... should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,” Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor’s apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor’s address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city’s top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. ""Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can’t knock and announce,” Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor’s mother says neighbors didn’t hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor's trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family’s home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation’s war on drugs. They have become the “norm” for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. “It’s an abuse of authority across the board,” said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who's been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn’t always justified. “If you’re going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn’t be there with a search warrant in the first place. It’s not worthwhile,” said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. “Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,” Kraska said. “At the end of the day, banning them probably won’t accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.” Kentucky has a “stand your ground” law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven’t protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker's dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor’s death could be an “ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,” Kraska said. “These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,” he added. “There’s been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.” ------ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.

1622270507,2020-06-01 09:00:07,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/politics/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden’s campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. ""Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward,"" Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. “It doesn't really matter what I think,” she said. “What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks.” Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. “As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?” Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” ""And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden’s running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has “proliferated.” “The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,” he said. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. ---- Barrow reported from Atlanta.

1622270498,2020-06-01 09:10:03,Use of force criticized in protests about police brutality,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200601/use-of-force-criticized-in-protests-about-police-brutality,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"As protests grip the nation, officers have doused crowds with pepper spray, struck protesters with batons, steered police cars into throngs, shoved demonstrators and screamed curses. Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand – like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren’t surprised because they’ve endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, “What’s happening, it’s the way American society has always been,” White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against “passionate” young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. “Too much force is not the answer to this,” said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. “It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” he said. “That’s wrong on its face and that hasn’t happened in the history of protests in this city.” Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.” In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light 'em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” ------ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

CHRISTO, ARTIST KNOWN FOR HUGE, EYE-POPPING ART DISPLAYS, DEAD AT 84 Fox News crews on the scene in SoHo reported hundreds of people stealing from luxury stores – including Chanel and Dior – for hours on Sunday night going into the early hours of Monday morning. The looters were seen piling shoplifted merchandise into vehicles while others rode off with the merchandise in black garbage bags balanced on CitiBikes. Eyewitnesses told Fox News the looting started before 11 p.m. Sunday, following a day of protests demanding justice for the death of George Floyd while in police custody. The daytime demonstrations had been largely peaceful, according to NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea. “Most of the day we had large crowds throughout the city in multiple boroughs [on Sunday]. But when it got dark, things changed and it changed rapidly,” Shea said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning. “We anticipated it, but you saw large groups of people had no inclination to all this protest once it got dark, particularly in the area of SoHo between Canal and West Broadway. We had a number of stores broken into.” Fox News reported nearly two dozen stores destroyed, defaced or broken into, and looters emptying the shops while throwing debris at news crews and littering the streets with discarded shoeboxes and miscellaneous clothing items. Meanwhile, de Blasio took to Twitter before midnight on Sunday to say he had been at Union Square and Barclays Center but saw little protest activity. Looters were seen on the scene past 3 a.m. The NYPD avoided scrimmages with thieves and instead focused on clearing the streets, which saw thousands of demonstrators throughout the weekend. A spokesperson for the NYPD told Fox News over 250 arrests were made on Sunday and seven officers were injured in the process. Additionally, 11 police vehicles were vandalized, the NYPD said.

Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just beginning to reopen their businesses after the coronavirus shutdowns, to clean up their shattered stores. In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes. Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district's entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd's killing. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform.

All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd's death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district's entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd's killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said.",0.0

Workers boarded up a Chanel store in Soho, one of many in the historic district known for cobblestone streets and cast iron buildings where people smashed windows and plundered shops overnight. “There were hundreds and hundreds of arrests in a very short time in that area,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said on NBC's “Today.” A 21-year-old man was shot in the neighborhood around 12:30 a.m. and was taken to a hospital, police said. They said his injuries were not life-threatening. Mobs of people rampaged down the sidewalks in Soho and other neighborhoods including Union Square, breaking into Rolex, Kate Spade and Prada boutiques as well as electronics stores. “This is like a dream. Like a movie,” said New York City resident Sean Jones as he watched the destruction. “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this ... again."" For the third day in a row, protests across New York City over the May 25 death of Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck — were largely peaceful during the daylight hours Sunday but turned violent at night. “ When it got dark, it got ugly and it got ugly quick,” Shea said. There were gestures from police officers earlier Sunday intended to show sympathy with marchers. Some officers knelt with protesters in an intersection as an organizer called out the names of people killed by police. But the police department has come under criticism for other interactions with demonstrators over the weekend including a confrontation in Brooklyn on Saturday when two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. Shea said the confrontation is one of “about six"" that the department’s internal affairs bureau is investigating. Similar protests have flared up around the nation in response to Floyd's death and other recent racially charged killings. Mayor Bill de Blasio has rejected the idea of a curfew like those adopted in several other major cities. Shea said he didn't think curfew would work. “We could impose a curfew today,” he said. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen. If people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on.”",0.0

Hundreds of people were at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in Bryan, Texas, including Quincy Mason Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sons. “I’m really excited about all this,” Floyd said. “Everyone is coming out and showing him love. I love this. My heart is really touched by all this.” Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Mason said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It’s going to be tough to get over this day by day.” The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area.",0.0

A tally of arrests during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday was not immediately available. Police planned to release that information later Monday, said Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He said the city “was relatively quiet” during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. Several hundred people took part in a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon that started at the Indiana Statehouse. The group marched several blocks to outside the City-County Building, where those taking part laid on the ground while the names were read off of African Americans who have died in confrontations with police. The overnight curfew imposed by Mayor Joe Hogsett came after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, has sparked protests nationwide. Shortly after the curfew took effect Sunday night, police Chief Randal Taylor urged protesters during a news conference to return home in compliance with the mayor’s order. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. “Go home for yourself, go home for your family, go home for your city,” Taylor said. “There is nothing you will prove tonight by violating this order.” Two people died amid several shootings late Saturday and early Sunday, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. Police said no officers had fired their guns. One of those fatally shot was Chris Beaty, who was a defensive lineman on Indiana University’s football team from 2000 to 2004 and has recently managed Indianapolis nightclubs, The Indianapolis Star reported. Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting Saturday night a few blocks from downtown Indianapolis’ Monument Circle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Young said the circumstances of Beaty’s fatal shooting remained under investigation. “It’s still early on in the investigation and I don’t believe we have any suspects at this point. We have very limited information,” he said Monday morning. Beaty recently launched Worldwide Masks – a company that sells one-piece face coverings to prevent the spread of germs, with fellow entrepreneur Joe Babish, The Indianapolis Star reported. Large protests happened elsewhere in Indiana on Saturday, with police in Hammond using tear gas to break up protesters and officers blocking marchers from going onto Interstate 80/94. Fort Wayne police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd after Friday night’s demonstration resulted in some protesters throwing rocks at officers and breaking dozens of windows on downtown businesses.",0.0

The S&P 500 index fell 0.4% in the first few minutes of trading Monday, led by declines in technology and health care companies. The index is coming off its second month of solid gains. Overseas, Hong Kong’s market rose after President Donald Trump didn’t pull out of a trade truce reached earlier with China. But traders still worried that more trade friction was on the way. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: Global stock markets mostly rose Monday after President Donald Trump avoided reigniting a trade war with China, though U.S. indexes appeared set to open lower amid concerns about the violent protests erupting across the country. Hong Kong’s stock market surged more than 3% and European shares traded higher, while Wall Street futures were down slightly. Investors appeared relieved that Trump avoided pulling out of a truce in a tariff war with Beijing in his response to Beijing’s security law on Hong Kong. In the U.S., that seemed overshadowed by the civic unrest, where protests against police brutality and racism have become violent in multiple cities. The protests come at a time of surging unemployment and just as the country was looking to ease its lockdown measures. Some fear the demonstrations could lead to a new increase in coronavirus contagions. Futures for the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down 0.1%. In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London added 1% to 6,139 and the CAC 40 in France advanced 1.1% to 4,747 after new surveys showed a recovery in manufacturing activity, though it is still contracting due to the pandemic lockdowns. German markets were closed for a holiday. Earlier, in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 3.4% to close at 23,732.52. The Shanghai Composite Index rose to 2,915.43 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.8% to 22,062.39. A monthly gauge of Chinese manufacturing issued by a business magazine, Caixin, edged up to a four-month high, but new export orders fell from an already low level in a sign of weak global demand. In Seoul, the Kospi in Seoul added 1.7% to 2,065.08. Australia’s S&P-ASX 200 was 1.1% higher at 5,819.20 and India’s Sensex added 3.2% to 33,474.98. Singapore gained 1.9% and Bangkok rose 0.6%. U.S.-Chinese tension has weighed on investor optimism about the global economy’s recovery from its deepest slump since the 1930s. As China and some European countries revive economic activity, stock markets have been regaining much of this year’s losses despite rising numbers of virus cases in the United States, Brazil and some other countries. Before the virus outbreak, the global economy already was under pressure from the U.S.-Chinese dispute over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus. The world’s two biggest traders had raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods. They signed a truce in January but Trump has added to market jitters by threatening to pull out if China doesn’t buy more American goods. On Friday, Trump said Washington would begin eliminating agreements that gave Hong Kong privileges that China lacked, including exemption from some import controls. That followed the ceremonial Chinese legislature’s endorsement of a security law for Hong Kong that pro-democracy advocates say undermines the autonomy promised to the former British colony. It is unclear how the decision might affect U.S. companies in Hong Kong or the territory’s status as a finance and business center. Business groups say the uncertainty might hurt its appeal to foreign investors. In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 8 cents to $35.41 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained $1.78 on Friday to settle at $35.49.

In the wake of Floyd’s death, murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the day Monday. Please check back for updates: 10:24 a.m.: Minnesota AG ‘seriously looking’ at prosecuting other officers Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on SiriusXM’s “The Joe Madison Show” on Monday that he’s “very seriously looking at” prosecuting the three other officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death. “I’m not prepared to announce anything at this moment,” Ellison said, adding, “I will say that we are going to hold everybody accountable for what they did wrong and what they did that’s illegal.” “We are reviewing the video tapes, the audio tapes, all the evidence, and we will make a charging decision based on the facts that we can prove,” he said. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Sunday that he has asked Ellison to help with the case. At a Sunday night news conference Ellison said he wanted to give people “a dose of reality.” “Prosecuting police officers for misconduct is very difficult,” Ellison said. “We are pursing justice relentlessly and we are pursuing it on behalf of the people of Minnesota.” 9:36 a.m.: 481 arrests in Twin Cities over the weekend In Minnesota’s Twin Cities — the epicenter of the protests — 481 people were arrested over the weekend, state officials said. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter is imploring the public to remain focused on what caused the protests to begin in the first place: the death of George Floyd. “The situation in our city continues to be an enormous amount of rage and frustration, thankfully we’ve been able to work with many of our community members as we’ve called for peace but not for patience,” Carter said. Speaking about the violence during the protests, the mayor said that while “anger is really the only human compassionate response … we also know that those of us who are disgusted by injustices against black and brown people in our community cannot exercise that disgust by furthering those injustices.” Carter said there are clearly people from outside the community that are coming in to join the protests, but the more important thing is how the acts of violence amid the demonstrations is taking the focus away from Floyd’s death. “George Floyd ought to still be alive. All four of those officers need to be held accountable,” Carter said. “All four of those officers are complicit in his death.” “We have deep soul searching work to do in our country to make sure this pattern stops,” he added. 9:13 a.m.: Miami-Dade County mayor wants to honor protesters who stopped potential looters  In Miami, video overnight showed a group of protesters shattering the glass door of a CVS as they prepared to loot the store — only to be stopped by a group of peaceful protesters who formed a line to prevent them from entering. Police then arrived and dispersed the crowd. Monday morning, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he wants to meet and commend the protesters who kept the potential looters from breaking in. “Anyone who can identify the people responsible for keeping the peace as they, themselves, properly exercised their right to assemble and protest, please reach out to the Mayor’s office via social media on the Mayor’s Facebook page Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez, or on Twitter @mayorgimenez,” he said in a statement. 7:05 a.m.: St. Paul mayor wants focus to remain on George Floyd While acknowledging the “anger,” “rage” and “frustration” from protesters, St. Paul, Minnesota Mayor Melvin Carter implored the public to remain focused on what caused the protests to begin in the first place: the death of George Floyd. “The situation in our city continues to be an enormous amount of rage and frustration, thankfully we’ve been able to work with many of our community members as we’ve called for peace but not for patience,” Carter said. Speaking about the violence during the protests, the mayor said that while “Anger is really the only human compassionate response … we also know that those of us who are disgusted by injustices against black and brown people in our community cannot exercise that disgust by furthering those injustices.” Carter said there are clearly people from outside the community that are coming in to join the protests, but the more important thing is how the acts of violence amid the demonstrations is taking the focus away from Floyd’s death. “George Floyd ought to still be alive. All four of those officers need to be held accountable,” Carter said. “All four of those officers are complicit in his death.” “We have deep soul searching work to do in our country to make sure this pattern stops,” he added. 6:45 a.m.: Over 250 arrested in NYC protests overnight; St. Patrick’s Cathedral vandalized More than 250 people were arrested during protests overnight Sunday in New York City, which included significant looting, vandalism and theft of luxury stores in SoHo in the early morning hours, the NYPD said on Monday. A half dozen police officers were hurt. None of the injuries are considered life threatening. The NYPD believes the destruction of property, particularly at high-end retail stores, is part of a preconceived plan by agitators who have co-opted the demonstrations related to Floyd’s death. Destruction of police vehicles is also part of that plan, the NYPD has said. St. Patrick’s Cathedral was also defaced on Saturday, police said. Of the more than 1,000 arrested since protests began in New York City on May 28, approximately 1 in 7 is from outside the city, the NYPD said. “We’re seeing a lot of outside and independent agitators connected with anarchist groups who are deliberately trying to provoke acts of violence,” Deputy Police Commissioner John Miller said on Sunday. Arrested protesters have come from 10 states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Jersey, Nevada, Virginia, Maryland, Texas and Minnesota Miller said the NYPD has “high confidence” certain anarchist groups anticipated the eruption of protests over Floyd’s death in custody and began to raise bail money and recruit medics. “We believe that a significant number of people from out of the area, as well as the advanced preparation, advanced scouts, having resupply routes for gasoline and accelerants, the raising of bail, the placement of medics, taken together is a strong indicator that they planned to act with disorder and violence,” Miller said. These “agitators” came prepared to commit property damage, Miller said, and directed followers to do so selectively, only in wealthier areas and at high-end stores. The NYPD is now investigating which individuals and groups have been behind it. Miller said they appear to be only loosely affiliated and skilled at using encrypted communication. 3:01 a.m.: Seven police officers hospitalized in Boston, 40 people arrested As of 3:00 a.m. this morning, the Boston Police Department has confirmed that seven injured officers have been transported to the hospital with many more treated on scene. A total of 21 police cruisers have been damaged and about 40 individuals placed under arrest during the protest. The situation remains active and the numbers are subject to change, according to the BPD. 2:22 a.m.: Derek Chauvin moved to state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell has confirmed that Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of killing George Floyd, is now in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota. Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchison made the request to move him over concerns about the large number of people who could possibly be booked into Hennepin County Jail tonight and concerns over COVID-19. Chauvin’s court date has also been pushed back a week to next Monday, June 8 at 2:30 p.m. local time. 1:40 a.m.: In several cities, protesters and police share a hug Although Sunday’s protests included much of the looting and violence of the previous week’s demonstrations, there were signs throughout the country that relations between protesters and police were warming. In Orlando, Florida, photos on social media showed two police officers holding hands with protesters through a barricade. A video on Twitter showed a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in Miami detach himself from a security line to offer a hug to a woman sitting on a motor scooter, who said, “I appreciate your patience” after troopers remained calm when protesters approached them. Elsewhere in Miami, video showed a group of protesters shattering the glass door of a CVS as they prepared to loot the store — only to be stopped by a group of peaceful protesters who formed a line to prevent them from entering until the police arrived and dispersed the crowd. In New York City’s Foley Square, a cheer went up among protesters when a group of NYPD officers took a knee in a show of solidarity. In Oklahoma City, cameras also captured sheriff’s deputies taking a knee, with some hugging protesters near the Oklahoma County Jail. And in Flint, Michigan, video showed Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson telling a crowd of protesters that he’d ordered his deputies to lower their batons and that he wanted to make the event “a parade, not a protest.” The crowd then applauded the sheriff and invited him to join the march. 1:12 a.m.: Entire Washington, D.C. National Guard now activated The entire Washington, D.C. National Guard has been activated by Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to assist U.S. Park Police in the city, says Master Sergeant Craig Clapper, a spokesman for the DC National Guard. Clapper says the additional forces will be unarmed and in a support role to U.S. Park police and that they will be equipped in protective riot gear. Last night, elements of the D.C. National Guard were sent to Lafayette Park in front of the White House and to other landmarks on the National Mall. The Army Secretary is in charge of the D.C. National Guard because it is the nation’s only federalized National Guard since it is not run by a state governor due to the fact that the district is not a state. Clapper would not disclose the number of additional guardsmen that would be activated. The size of the entire D.C. National Guard is 3,400 personnel. 12:41 a.m.: Clashes continue in some cities, while others are more calm Arrests during Sunday’s protests have driven the total number of demonstrator arrests to more than 4,000 since protests began early in the week, according to reports. Confrontations between police and protesters continued for another night in Brooklyn, New York, where demonstrators clashed with officers outside Barclay’s Center. In Boston, an SUV drove through a crowd of protesters but officials said no one appeared to be seriously hurt. In Washington, D.C., members of the U.S. Marshals Service and DEA agents were called in to assist National Guard troops responding to protests near the White House, a Department of Justice official said. In Atlanta, two police officers were fired for using excessive force during an arrest of two college students during Saturday night’s protests. Video of the incident appeared to show officers Tase the two students as they sat in their vehicle, and then forcefully drag them out of the car. Protests in other cities, however, remained largely peaceful Sunday. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said protesters were “largely cooperative” in his state. Large crowds surrounded the State Capitol in Denver but stayed calm, according to reports. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

The white officer, shown wearing a helmet, face shield, and bulletproof vest, stood in front of Bearno’s By-the-Bridge, a pizza chain restaurant near the Second Street Bridge and the Yum Center. A group of men, reportedly the initial protest organizers, wore face masks and linked arms to prevent other members of the crowd from reaching the officer while he waited for his squad to return, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FEAR WORST AFTER RIOTING, LOOTING DESTROY STOREFRONTS DURING PANDEMIC “Last night in Louisville. Protesters protected an officer separated from his squad,” one Louisville native, Nancy Duncan, tweeted, sharing the newspaper’s photos. “I hope the news covers this.” Duncan, trying to shift the narrative, responded to tweets from MSNBC contributor Joyce Alene and AM Joy’s Joy Reid. “Remarkable info coming out of this presser: Gov. Tim Walls, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and now MN attorney general Keith Ellison ALL alleging outside forces, domestic and possibly foreign, have post-Tuesday infiltrated the state, and are,” Joy had written. Alene, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama who was nominated by President Obama, responded: “The DOJ I worked in would be investigating this already. But we would’ve also tried to avoid this fever pitch, by using the Community Relations Service to listen & give the community a strong voice. There would be a pattern and practice investigation into the police departments.” The photos shared in Duncan’s tweet were taken Thursday, the same day between 500 and 600 people marched through downtown Louisville chanting Breonna Taylor’s name and demanding the officers involved in her death be charged. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who busted down her front door on March 13. Her boyfriend shot at the officers, and Taylor was struck by their returning gunfire. No drugs were recovered from the scene. Crowds came out Thursday after The Courier-Journal obtained and released the 911 call made by Taylor’s boyfriend, 27-year-old Kenneth Walker, who can be heard saying: “I don’t know what is happening. Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend.” The “no-knock” warrant does not require law enforcement to announce or identify themselves during a raid.

Hundreds of people were at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in Bryan, Texas, including Quincy Mason Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sons. “I’m really excited about all this,” Floyd said. “Everyone is coming out and showing him love. I love this. My heart is really touched by all this.” Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason Floyd, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Connie Mason Floyd said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Quincy Mason Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It’s going to be tough to get over this day by day.” The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area.",0.0

The message from Obama, who previously decried Floyd's death last week when he said the killings of black men at the hands of police ""shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"" follows a weekend that saw an escalation in protests nationwide. ""Let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it. If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves,"" Obama wrote in an essay on Medium. He added, ""The bottom line is this: if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn't between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."" In his statement on Friday, Obama called for officials in Minnesota to bring justice in Floyd's death. ""It falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station -- including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day -- to work together to create a 'new normal' in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts,"" Obama said at the time.

One officer was shot, but is doing “OK,” Sikorski said. Another officer returned fire but the police chief did not specify if the suspect was hit. A police chase involving several law enforcement agencies ensued to pursue the suspect’s vehicle as they fled the scene. The vehicle later crashed, and several occupants were arrested, Sikorski said.

Matson condemned the shooting violence saying it was “not about promoting justice and they were not about honoring the memory of George Floyd.” “Let it be known that the perpetrators of tonight’s activities will be held accountable for the damage and harm that they’ve caused,” he added. “Our police department is committed to the safety of our citizens and this community and will not let the perpetrators from this last night continue to terrorize this city without consequences.” Sikorski echoed the mayor’s sentiments calling the shooting incidents “unacceptable.” Several stores and establishments near the mall, including a Dick’s Sporting Goods and Burger King, were defaced and damaged. “It’s not who we are as Davenport, it’s not who we are in the Quad Cities. And as the police chief, I commit to you, and the sheriff is here as well, we will be here tonight, today, tomorrow, the next day, to make sure our community’s safe. We will be here.” The mayor has issued a citywide curfew to tamp down on violence.

Hundreds of people were at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in Bryan, Texas, including Quincy Mason Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sons. “I’m really excited about all this,” Floyd said. “Everyone is coming out and showing him love. I love this. My heart is really touched by all this.” Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason Floyd, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5 years old, when he last saw his father. It wasn’t until after Memorial Day when news of George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis made it to his son. “I didn’t recognize who it was until Mom called and told me,” he said. “She said, ‘Do you know who that guy was?’ I said no. she said, ‘That’s your father.'” Floyd said people in Bryan have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He said some people at first questioned it. “They kept asking, ‘Do you have any proof?’ and I said ‘Yeah, look at my face and look at his face,'” he said. “You can tell.” Both Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. “The violence is not the right way to do it,” Connie Mason Floyd said. “Now, this is beautiful, but the violence, it won’t solve nothing.” “Tearing up things, it’s not going to solve anything,” Quincy Mason Floyd said. “My dad is in peace and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It’s going to be tough to get over this day by day.” The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area.",0.0
1622422897,2020-06-01 11:33:19,Music industry calls for Black Out Tuesday amid unrest,https://www.wane.com/entertainment-news/music-industry-calls-for-black-out-tuesday-amid-unrest/,en,True,"recordings (audio), blacks, music",94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"NEW YORK (AP) — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as riots erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and the worldwide riots. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.” Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

1622422896,2020-06-01 06:15:22,US heads into a new week shaken by violence and pandemic,https://www.wane.com/news/us-heads-into-a-new-week-shaken-by-violence-and-pandemic/,en,True,"labor, police, demonstrations and riots",94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people. All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and several other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security.

(Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March, which also attracted national attention in May. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags, while a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said.",0.0

The “bottom line,” he wrote, is that “if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn’t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.” The nation’s first and only African American president began by acknowledging that “the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,” noting that most people demonstrating have been “peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring.” He also noted that “police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood” that the protesters “deserve our respect and support.” He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations. In his post, Obama requested people “not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it.” From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that “the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.” He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it’s up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best. “The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,” he wrote. Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic. “I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting — that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,” he wrote. “But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful.” He said the next moment in American history can be “a real turning point” if “we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action.” I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 1, 2020 The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, “to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action.” This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation’s unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. “This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. “It can’t be ‘normal.’ If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.” My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend. Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that “thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd” and, referencing the military, that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet was flagged by Twitter as “glorifying violence.” Trump on Sunday blamed “ANTIFA” for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear.

Demonstrations on city streets — some peaceful, some violent — from coast to coast have taken place since the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The unrest comes as people around the world gradually try to return to normal. The first day of June saw coronavirus restrictions ease from Asia to Europe. The Colosseum opened its ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh, golfers played in Greece, students returned in Britain and Dutch bars and restaurants were free to welcome hungry, thirsty patrons. Here are some of AP’s top stories Monday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities. ___ What’s Happening Today: — Countries around the Mediterranean Sea tentatively kicked off a summer season where tourists could bask in their sunny beaches while still being protected by social distancing measures from the coronavirus. Greece lifted lockdown measures for hotels, campsites, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while beaches and museums reopened in Turkey, and bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums came back to life in the Netherlands. Commuter trains, taxis, ride-sharing cars, special shuttle buses and motorcycles rumbled back on the roads in the Philippine capital, Manila, but were only allowed to carry a fraction of their capacity as a safeguard. — Protests erupting across the U.S. are threatening to upend efforts by health officials to track and contain the spread of coronavirus just as those efforts were finally getting underway. Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert others who may have been exposed and prevent them from spreading the disease further. — Primaries Tuesday in eight U.S. states are the biggest test to date of campaigning during the coronavirus era, a way for parties to test-drive new ways of getting out the vote during a time when it can be dangerous to leave your home. Voters in Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota will cast ballots in both the Democratic presidential contest and a host of down-ballot primaries for everything from governors to state representatives. — COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted black Americans, infecting and killing them at higher rates across the nation. Experts say the pandemic has also exacerbated existing economic disparities and raised fresh concerns about the survival of black businesses, many of which have been the backbone of cities like Detroit and Atlanta for years. — A California biotech company says its experimental drug remdesivir improved symptoms when given for five days to moderately ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Gilead Sciences’ drug is the only treatment that’s been shown in a rigorous experiment to help fight the coronavirus. ___ WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. Here are the symptoms of the virus compared with the common flu. One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water.

You have to dominate.” “You have to know what you’re dealing with,” the president told the nation’s governors. “And it’s happened before, this happened numerous times and the only time it’s successful is when you’re weak and most of you are weak.” Trump said they were making a mistake by letting looters destroy property and called for arresting and prosecuting those captured on camera, saying they should be put in jail for 10 years. “Law enforcement response is not gonna work unless we dominate the streets, as the president said, we have to control the streets,” Barr added in his own set of remarks. “We have to control the crowds and not to react to what’s happening on the street and that requires a strong presence.” The president said many governors were slow to call on the National Guard. “Why you’re not calling them up I don’t know — but you making a mistake and making yourselves look like fools.” “These are terrorists,” President Trump said of the protesters. “Antifa and the radical left.” In his opening remarks, he made no mention of George Floyd, the African American man killed in police custody last week in Minneapolis, and did not address the protesters concerns about racial inequality. While many of the governors on the call avoided directly criticizing the president over his response to the protests, Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker confronted Trump over his recent rhetoric, saying he was in many cases making the situation “worse.” “I’ve been extraordinarily concerned about the rhetoric that’s been used by you,” Pritzker said. “It’s been inflammatory and it’s not okay for that officer to choke George Floyd to death, but we have to call for calm. We have to have police reform called for.” Pritzker added, “the rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House is making it worse. People are feeling real pain out there. And we’ve got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we’re addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protesters. That will help us to bring order.” Trump shot back, defending his comments made thus far about Floyd and attacking Pritzker over his response to the spread of coronavirus in Illinois. “I don’t like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus and I don’t like your rhetoric much either,” Trump said. “I think you could have done a much better job, frankly, but that’s okay we know we don’t agree with each other.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

The National Guard has been activated for civil unrest response in Washington, D.C. and 23 states: Arizona, Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio,, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In the wake of Floyd’s death, murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the day Monday. Please check back for updates: 12:17 p.m.: 1 dead from police shooting in Louisville The Kentucky State Police will independently investigate a deadly shooting that took place overnight at the hands of police, Gov. Andy Beshear said Around midnight, officers with the Louisville police and the Kentucky National Guard were trying to disperse a crowd when they “were fired upon,” Beshear said. The local police and National Guard returned fire, “resulting in a death,” Beshear said. Additional details were not immediately released. 12 p.m.: Nearly 700 arrested in Chicago Just on Sunday, 699 people were arrested in Chicago, primarily for looting, David Brown, superintendent of the Chicago Police, said Monday. Brown addressed the rioters and looters directly, saying, “you disgraced the name of Mr. Floyd by your actions.” “Hate can never drive out hate,” Brown said, and he vowed, “we will hold you accountable.” Brown also address the late George Floyd directly, saying, “We are embarrassed by the cops in Minneapolis’ use of force, asphyxiating you on the streets.” “We stand with Mr. Floyd’s family,” he said.  11:38 a.m. Barr sending riot teams to Miami, DC A senior Department of Justice official says U.S. Attorney General William Barr has directed the Bureau of Prisons to send riot teams (Special Operation Response Teams) to Miami and Washington, D.C. to help with crowd control, a senior DOJ official said. The team was already present in Miami over the weekend, this official said. On Sunday night, Barr also dispatched the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team to help D.C. police. All FBI field offices have been instructed to set up command posts to deal specifically with the protests in nearby communities, the official said.  11:25 a.m.: 2-day curfew ordered in DC Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has ordered a two-day curfew, beginning at 7 p.m. Monday. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham warned, if you are not a member of the media or performing an essential function, “local and federal police will take you into custody.” Police arrested 88 people related to the violent demonstrations Sunday night, Newsham said. Of those, 44 were charged with felony rioting. Newsham said the city is looking at federal statutes that might be used to prosecute some of those arrested. Clapper said the additional forces will be unarmed and in a support role to U.S. Park police and that they will be equipped in protective riot gear. 11:12 a.m.: NYC mayor addresses his daughter’s arrest for protesting More than 250 people were arrested during protests overnight Sunday in New York City, which included significant looting, vandalism and theft of luxury stores in SoHo in the early morning hours of Monday. Looting is rare for New York City and Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday condemned the behavior as “unacceptable.” The NYPD believes the destruction of property, particularly at high-end retail stores, is part of a preconceived plan by agitators who have co-opted the demonstrations related to Floyd’s death. “We’re seeing a lot of outside and independent agitators connected with anarchist groups who are deliberately trying to provoke acts of violence,” Deputy Police Commissioner John Miller said on Sunday. These “agitators” came prepared to commit property damage, Miller said, and directed followers to do so selectively, only in wealthier areas and at high-end stores. More than 1,000 people have been arrested since protests began in New York City on Thursday. Of those arrested, about one in seven is from outside the city, the NYPD said. Arrested protesters have come from at least 10 states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Jersey, Nevada, Virginia, Maryland, Texas and Minnesota. Among the 345 arrested Saturday night was de Blasio’s 25-year-old daughter, Chiara. She was arrested for unlawful assembly and given a desk appearance ticket, according to NYPD sources. “I love my daughter deeply,” the mayor said Monday. “I’m proud of her that she cares so much.” “She was acting peacefully. She believes that everything she did was in the spirit of peaceful, respectful protest,” de Blasio said. “I will let her speak for herself … But I admire that she was out there trying to change something that she thought was unjust.” The NYPD overall “showed restraint” as they worked to keep the peace and allow demonstrators to continue to protest on Sunday, the mayor said. But De Blasio did condemn what he called the rare act of officers acting inappropriately, bringing up the “troubling video” of two police cars moving through a crowd in Brooklyn Saturday night. Video showed one police SUV being blocked by a group of protesters behind a barricade as various items and objects can be seen striking the vehicle. Another NYPD SUV then pulled up alongside the first vehicle before both of them can be seen accelerating into the crowd of people knocking many of them over as the screaming and yelling from the crowd began to intensify. “Not acceptable,” the mayor said, stressing that there’s “no situation where a police vehicle should drive into a crowd of protesters or New Yorkers.” The incident is under investigation. De Blasio also called for the officer who pulled a gun on a group of protesters to be fired. “Any officer who does the wrong thing there needs to be consequences and they need to be fast,” the mayor said. 10:24 a.m.: Minnesota AG ‘seriously looking’ at prosecuting other officers Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on SiriusXM’s “The Joe Madison Show” on Monday that he’s “very seriously looking at” prosecuting the three other officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death. “I’m not prepared to announce anything at this moment,” Ellison said, adding, “I will say that we are going to hold everybody accountable for what they did wrong and what they did that’s illegal.” “We are reviewing the video tapes, the audio tapes, all the evidence, and we will make a charging decision based on the facts that we can prove,” he said. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Sunday that he has asked Ellison to help with the case. At a Sunday night news conference Ellison said he wanted to give people “a dose of reality.” “Prosecuting police officers for misconduct is very difficult,” Ellison said. “We are pursing justice relentlessly and we are pursuing it on behalf of the people of Minnesota.” 9:36 a.m.: 481 arrests in Twin Cities over the weekend In Minnesota’s Twin Cities — the epicenter of the protests — 481 people were arrested over the weekend, state officials said. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter is imploring the public to remain focused on what caused the protests to begin in the first place: the death of George Floyd. “The situation in our city continues to be an enormous amount of rage and frustration, thankfully we’ve been able to work with many of our community members as we’ve called for peace but not for patience,” Carter said. Speaking about the violence during the protests, the mayor said that while “anger is really the only human compassionate response … we also know that those of us who are disgusted by injustices against black and brown people in our community cannot exercise that disgust by furthering those injustices.” Carter said there are clearly people from outside the community that are coming in to join the protests, but the more important thing is how the acts of violence amid the demonstrations is taking the focus away from Floyd’s death. “George Floyd ought to still be alive. All four of those officers need to be held accountable,” Carter said. “All four of those officers are complicit in his death.” “We have deep soul searching work to do in our country to make sure this pattern stops,” he added. 9:13 a.m.: Miami-Dade County mayor wants to honor protesters who stopped potential looters  In Miami, video overnight showed a group of protesters shattering the glass door of a CVS as they prepared to loot the store — only to be stopped by a group of peaceful protesters who formed a line to prevent them from entering. Police then arrived and dispersed the crowd. Monday morning, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he wants to meet and commend the protesters who kept the potential looters from breaking in. “Anyone who can identify the people responsible for keeping the peace as they, themselves, properly exercised their right to assemble and protest, please reach out to the Mayor’s office via social media on the Mayor’s Facebook page Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez, or on Twitter @mayorgimenez,” he said in a statement. 7:05 a.m.: St. Paul mayor wants focus to remain on George Floyd While acknowledging the “anger,” “rage” and “frustration” from protesters, St. Paul, Minnesota Mayor Melvin Carter implored the public to remain focused on what caused the protests to begin in the first place: the death of George Floyd. “The situation in our city continues to be an enormous amount of rage and frustration, thankfully we’ve been able to work with many of our community members as we’ve called for peace but not for patience,” Carter said. Speaking about the violence during the protests, the mayor said that while “Anger is really the only human compassionate response … we also know that those of us who are disgusted by injustices against black and brown people in our community cannot exercise that disgust by furthering those injustices.” Carter said there are clearly people from outside the community that are coming in to join the protests, but the more important thing is how the acts of violence amid the demonstrations is taking the focus away from Floyd’s death. “George Floyd ought to still be alive. All four of those officers need to be held accountable,” Carter said. “All four of those officers are complicit in his death.” “We have deep soul searching work to do in our country to make sure this pattern stops,” he added. 6:45 a.m.: Over 250 arrested in NYC protests overnight; St. Patrick’s Cathedral vandalized More than 250 people were arrested during protests overnight Sunday in New York City, which included significant looting, vandalism and theft of luxury stores in SoHo in the early morning hours, the NYPD said on Monday. A half dozen police officers were hurt. None of the injuries are considered life threatening. The NYPD believes the destruction of property, particularly at high-end retail stores, is part of a preconceived plan by agitators who have co-opted the demonstrations related to Floyd’s death. Destruction of police vehicles is also part of that plan, the NYPD has said. St. Patrick’s Cathedral was also defaced on Saturday, police said. Of the more than 1,000 arrested since protests began in New York City on May 28, approximately 1 in 7 is from outside the city, the NYPD said. “We’re seeing a lot of outside and independent agitators connected with anarchist groups who are deliberately trying to provoke acts of violence,” Deputy Police Commissioner John Miller said on Sunday. Arrested protesters have come from 10 states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Jersey, Nevada, Virginia, Maryland, Texas and Minnesota Miller said the NYPD has “high confidence” certain anarchist groups anticipated the eruption of protests over Floyd’s death in custody and began to raise bail money and recruit medics. “We believe that a significant number of people from out of the area, as well as the advanced preparation, advanced scouts, having resupply routes for gasoline and accelerants, the raising of bail, the placement of medics, taken together is a strong indicator that they planned to act with disorder and violence,” Miller said. These “agitators” came prepared to commit property damage, Miller said, and directed followers to do so selectively, only in wealthier areas and at high-end stores. The NYPD is now investigating which individuals and groups have been behind it. Miller said they appear to be only loosely affiliated and skilled at using encrypted communication. 3:01 a.m.: Seven police officers hospitalized in Boston, 40 people arrested As of 3:00 a.m. this morning, the Boston Police Department has confirmed that seven injured officers have been transported to the hospital with many more treated on scene. A total of 21 police cruisers have been damaged and about 40 individuals placed under arrest during the protest. The situation remains active and the numbers are subject to change, according to the BPD. 2:22 a.m.: Derek Chauvin moved to state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell has confirmed that Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of killing George Floyd, is now in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights, Minnesota. Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchison made the request to move him over concerns about the large number of people who could possibly be booked into Hennepin County Jail tonight and concerns over COVID-19. Chauvin’s court date has also been pushed back a week to next Monday, June 8 at 2:30 p.m. local time. 1:40 a.m.: In several cities, protesters and police share a hug Although Sunday’s protests included much of the looting and violence of the previous week’s demonstrations, there were signs throughout the country that relations between protesters and police were warming. In Orlando, Florida, photos on social media showed two police officers holding hands with protesters through a barricade. A video on Twitter showed a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in Miami detach himself from a security line to offer a hug to a woman sitting on a motor scooter, who said, “I appreciate your patience” after troopers remained calm when protesters approached them. Elsewhere in Miami, video showed a group of protesters shattering the glass door of a CVS as they prepared to loot the store — only to be stopped by a group of peaceful protesters who formed a line to prevent them from entering until the police arrived and dispersed the crowd. In New York City’s Foley Square, a cheer went up among protesters when a group of NYPD officers took a knee in a show of solidarity. In Oklahoma City, cameras also captured sheriff’s deputies taking a knee, with some hugging protesters near the Oklahoma County Jail. And in Flint, Michigan, video showed Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson telling a crowd of protesters that he’d ordered his deputies to lower their batons and that he wanted to make the event “a parade, not a protest.” The crowd then applauded the sheriff and invited him to join the march. 1:12 a.m.: Entire Washington, D.C. National Guard now activated The entire Washington, D.C. National Guard has been activated by Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy to assist U.S. Park Police in the city, says Master Sergeant Craig Clapper, a spokesman for the DC National Guard. Clapper says the additional forces will be unarmed and in a support role to U.S. Park police and that they will be equipped in protective riot gear. Last night, elements of the D.C. National Guard were sent to Lafayette Park in front of the White House and to other landmarks on the National Mall. The Army Secretary is in charge of the D.C. National Guard because it is the nation’s only federalized National Guard since it is not run by a state governor due to the fact that the district is not a state. Clapper would not disclose the number of additional guardsmen that would be activated. The size of the entire D.C. National Guard is 3,400 personnel. 12:41 a.m.: Clashes continue in some cities, while others are more calm Arrests during Sunday’s protests have driven the total number of demonstrator arrests to more than 4,000 since protests began early in the week, according to reports. Confrontations between police and protesters continued for another night in Brooklyn, New York, where demonstrators clashed with officers outside Barclay’s Center. In Boston, an SUV drove through a crowd of protesters but officials said no one appeared to be seriously hurt. In Washington, D.C., members of the U.S. Marshals Service and DEA agents were called in to assist National Guard troops responding to protests near the White House, a Department of Justice official said. In Atlanta, two police officers were fired for using excessive force during an arrest of two college students during Saturday night’s protests. Video of the incident appeared to show officers Tase the two students as they sat in their vehicle, and then forcefully drag them out of the car. Protests in other cities, however, remained largely peaceful Sunday. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said protesters were “largely cooperative” in his state. Large crowds surrounded the State Capitol in Denver but stayed calm, according to reports. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

David McAtee, known in the Russell neighborhood for his popular barbeque stand outside of Dino's Food Mart, was killed early Monday morning as Louisville Metro Police and National Guard were trying to break up a ""large crowd"" in the parking lot of the mart at West Broadway and 26th Street. He was 53. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting, which will be a joint effort between the FBI Louisville Field Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District, federal officials said. More: 5 takeaways from Beshear on fatal shootings of David McAtee, Breonna Taylor in Louisville Hours after the governor publicly asked Louisville officials to release a ""significant"" amount of body camera footage from the incident ""as soon as possible,"" the city announced there wasn't any. Two LMPD officers involved in the shooting either had failed to activate or were not wearing body cameras during the incident, Mayor Greg Fischer told the public Monday night. The mayor also said Monday he fired LMPD Chief Steven Conrad, who announced he would retire at the end of June amid mounting public pressure following the police killing of 26-year-old ER technician Breonna Taylor. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Fischer said. On Monday morning, Conrad told the public that at about 12:15 a.m., someone from the crowd in the Dino's parking lot area at 26th and Broadway shot at authorities. When the police and guardsmen returned fire, they struck McAtee. No one else was injured. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, Louisville business owner, killed by authorities Conrad said it wasn't clear that it was McAtee who fired at officers, but ""several persons of interest"" were being interviewed following the shooting. Surveillance footage and police radio transmissions released by LMPD Monday evening offered no clear-cut answers. However, ""dozens"" of officers were at the scene, according to the recordings. Several protesters and Russell residents there Monday afternoon questioned why so many officers and troops were present in the first place before the shooting. The most significant protest Sunday night was roughly 20 blocks away downtown. Officials haven't said whether the crowd was made up of protesters or customers, and some activists have questioned whether there was a protest there at all. They said they were trying to enforce the curfew and that the site had a history of violent incidents. Acting LMPD Chief Rob Schroeder said the department will review the incident to determine whether any other policy violations occurred, and there ""will be discipline"" for failing to use cameras. ""That is completely unacceptable,"" Schroeder said. ""And there is no excuse for their clear failure to (follow) our policy."" The two LMPD officers involved in the shooting are Katie Crews and Allen Austin, neither of whom have any disciplinary records, according to LMPD. Austin joined in 2016 and Crews in 2018. The names of the National Guard troops have not been released. McAtee's body was at the scene until at least Monday afternoon. A group of LMPD officers in face shields formed a line just behind the crime scene tape, facing neighbors and protesters who came out throughout the day. By evening, there was still a crowd. Several folks gathered across from Dino's said they knew McAtee or have eaten his barbeque. A group of about 100 people lined the sidewalk across the street from the LMPD line throughout the day. Some said they'd been at other protests this weekend, but many said they just lived in the neighborhood. Metro Councilwoman Barbara Sexton Smith said Kentucky State Police was at the scene Monday afternoon, and that their investigations typically take more time. A State Police spokesman hadn't returned a request for comment from The Courier Journal. On Monday afternoon, the Rev. Steve Frank, president of Louisville's Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition, could be seen speaking with McAtee's family across the street from where he was killed. ""(His) mother wants to see her son,"" Frank told The Courier Journal. Carlos ""Bossfam"" Nolen, who often holds promotional events at a bar across from Dino's, said he knew McAtee well. ""This is a strong loss. A lot more would have happened on this corner if he wasn't here,"" Nolen said. ""Time after time I've witnessed him stop the escalation of violence with food."" The shooting outside Dino's Food Mart came after a curfew had taken effect at 9 p.m. Sunday as protests and unrest over the death of Taylor continued. Fischer extended the 9 p.m. through 6:30 a.m. curfew through June 8. On Saturday, Beshear announced that he was sending roughly 350 Kentucky National Guard personnel to Louisville to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" Although protests in downtown Louisville have started out peaceful each evening, the scenes have turned more chaotic after sunset. Seven people were shot and wounded during Thursday night's protest. Looting, vandalism and damage to physical and private property exploded Friday night. Sunday night had the fewest protesters overall, police said. ""And now our mission is to work fast, to be thorough and to get full results so that this family can have full accountability and the truth,"" Beshear said.

Chiara de Blasio was taken into custody in Manhattan after allegedly blocking traffic and then refusing to move, law enforcement sources told the New York Post. NYC POLICE COMMISSIONER ON NIGHT OF VIOLENT RIOTS, LOOTING: ‘IT TURNED DARK AND IT TURNED UGLY’ Yet De Blasio said when he and his wife Chirlane asked their daughter to explain the situation on Monday morning, she shared a different story. “She was very clear that she believed she was following the instructions of police officers and doing what they were asking,” de Blasio told reporters. “Absolutely she was abundantly clear — she was peacefully protesting, not doing anything that would provoke a negative response,” he added. New York City was hit hard by looters Sunday night who targeted high-end retail stores and left a trail of destruction in their wake. De Blasio said he wasn’t aware of his daughter’s arrest until a member of the media sent an inquiry to his office seeking his comment. “It’s a reality that every parent faces — that you never know when your kids become adults, how they are going to go about their lives,” he said. “Sometimes you get surprises.” LUXURY STORES LOOTED IN NEW YORK CITY PROTESTS The mayor said Chiara had participated in a peaceful protest a few nights before her arrest. “And when I found out she had been arrested, I finally reached her with Chirlane and I asked her recount the whole story and look – I love my daughter deeply, I honor her. She is such a good human being. She only wants to do good in the world,” he continued. “She wants to see a better and more peaceful world. She believes a lot of change is needed. I’m proud of her that she cares so much and that she was willing to go out there and do something about it.” However, a law enforcement source that spoke to the New York Post described the scene where Ciara was arrested as being a “real hotspot” where police cars were getting burned and “people were throwing and yelling, fighting with cops.” “There were thousands of people in that area at that time,” the source added, describing how officers declared the scene an unlawful assembly. RIOTING, LOOTING LINKED TO GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS LEAVES TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION ACROSS AMERICAN CITIES Upon arrest, Chiara listed her address as being the mayor’s mansion – but did not tell police that she was de Blasio’s daughter, the sources added. She was given a desk appearance ticket – and the arrest happened an hour before her father told demonstrators during a late-night press conference to “go home,” the New York Post reports. The NYPD Sergeant’s Benevolent Association union, which has been a longtime critic of de Blasio, tweeted out Chiara’s arrest report. The tweet reportedly contained her personal information, but Twitter ended up taking it down for violating its terms of service. “How can the NYPD protect the city of NY from rioting anarchist when the Mayors object throwing daughter is one of them,” the now-deleted tweet read. “Now we know why he is forbidding Mounted units to be mobilized and keeping the NYPD from doing their jobs.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP De Blasio ripped the tweet Monday as being “unconscionable.” “Police unions could be part of the change and the improvement in this city and this country,” he said. “They really should re-evaluate what they are doing at this moment in history.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of another night of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with looting and mayhem, and fires ignited in historic park Lafayette Park across from the White House. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds, and urged them to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis. As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Secret Service protocol would call for all those under the agency’s protection to be in the underground shelter. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

As he worked, the bristles of the plastic brush turned red. Blood washed down Vermont Street, mingling with a puddle by the yellow curb. The stain left in the alley was stubborn. It was the stain of two nights of rioting and police confrontation that overshadowed daytime peaceful protests. It was the stain of one of two killings Saturday night near the protests in Indianapolis, both by bullets. There were flames in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, New York City. People died in St. Louis, Chicago and here on this patch of concrete Downtown. Ben Jafari didn’t know whose blood he was scrubbing, or whether the person was black or white. He knew George Floyd had died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, the economy has left millions of people out of work, 100,000 people in the U.S. were dead from COVID-19 and that the country was a tinderbox. Victims identified:Former IU football player Chris Beaty, 18-year-old killed amid Downtown violence Jafari, who lived a few blocks away, didn’t know who was supposed to clean up the mess. On a Sunday morning in a week where it felt like the world was erupting and it was hard to say or do anything to make it better, he figured he could do this much. “Somebody had to,” he said. A startling discovery Only later would Jafari learn that the blood had come from Chris Beaty, someone he knew. It didn’t matter to him then who it was, he would have done it for anyone. Jafari, 36, is a real estate developer and the managing partner of the nearby Colonial Apartments. He does not consider himself a political person, but he had marched in the peaceful protest Downtown Saturday afternoon. He’d never cleaned up after a death before. “So, he got shot over there,” Jafari said, pointing to Talbott and Vermont streets. He traced the blood, which spread across the alley for at least 40 feet, and gave his best hypothesis. “Then he ran here, wounded, and must’ve circled back,” he said, eyes following the red splotches as they increased in size. The metallic smell was overpowering, and the flies were buzzing. “He must’ve died here,” Jafari said, pointing to the biggest stain at his feet. “I really don’t know what to say.” An eerie calm the morning after Chris Beaty's death The Circle City was waking up. The morning sunshine tinted the destruction golden. The shards of shattered windows winked in the light. Jafari scrubbed. People, mostly white, were out on Massachusetts Avenue getting their Starbucks fixes and ordering Sunday brunch. A woman, pointing at her menu, said, “Oh, maybe hash browns? Let’s do that!” Graffitied buildings declared, “I can’t breathe.” Jafari scrubbed. Further down on Mass Ave., a couple held hands with their little boy and little girl, the daughter’s pink dress a splash of color against the plywood that covered the windows of a looted Walgreens. In the alley, a discarded protest sign demanded justice for George, Breonna, Ahmaud, Philando, Sandra. Jafari was still scrubbing. “I wipe it down, ” he said, pouring more ammonia. “But it never goes away.” 'I felt like it was my duty to clean it' Death was not familiar to Jafari. He’d only ever been to a single funeral. He typed “How to clean up blood” into Google. The internet suggested bleach. The grocery store down the street didn’t have any. The coronavirus pandemic had depleted the shelves. The next best and available option was ammonia. Jafari made his way back to the crime scene with two bottles and the plastic brush, along with a broom. “I felt like it was my duty to clean it,” he said. “Out of respect for the victim, out of respect for the city and the people.” He didn’t think twice about it, he said. The realization would hit him later — he was cleaning up what had spilled from somebody’s son, who nine hours earlier, had been alive, right here. It’s one thing to see the violence on TV, another to hear it in your own neighborhood, and something else altogether to kneel in someone else’s blood. “George Floyd can’t happen again,” he said. “We’re all just trying to put things back together.” When he gathered his things to go home, the stain was lighter, but still there. He looked down and saw that he’d carried the dead man’s blood home with him, on his shoes. The stain wasn't the blood of a stranger That Sunday night, he got a text from the property manager at Colonial Apartments. A tenant was missing. Jafari, lying in bed, read the unit number and knew, right away, who it was. Chris Beaty was an IU football player and one of the program’s most supportive alums. In Indianapolis, he became a well-known business leader and entrepreneur. He and Jafari had attended IU at the same time. Jafari had been to plenty of football games, so he probably saw Beaty play, but they never crossed paths until later. They met at an Indianapolis nightclub and learned how many friends they shared. Beaty had a huge smile and a million friends, and Jafari became one of them. Whenever they saw each other, they’d greet with a shake up, asking about each other’s lives, family, work. “Hey, what’s good, Brother?” Jafari teared up. The stain he’d been cleaning was not the blood of a stranger, and he could not leave a drop of it in the street. He set out Monday at 7 a.m. He returned to the grocery store and bought a heavy duty brush with thicker bristles. He picked up a bouquet of daisies. He knelt again beside the stubborn stain. He started to scrub. This story first appeared in the Bloomingtonian.",0.0

Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do.

One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Mayor Frank Jackson’s order, issued Sunday, had said the downtown area was off limits to everyone except those who live or work there and people going to medical appointments. Some people drove around the roadblocks, WEWS-TV reported. Gov. Mike DeWine had called out the National Guard and highway patrol Saturday to help enforce laws in Cleveland and Columbus, where the mayors said more than 100 properties were damaged. In Cincinnati, a nighttime curfew was extended through Monday. More than 100 people were arrested Sunday during protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

A tally of arrests during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday was not immediately available. Police planned to release that information later Monday, said Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He said the city ""was relatively quiet"" during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. Several hundred people took part in a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon that started at the Indiana Statehouse. The group marched several blocks to outside the City-County Building, where those taking part laid on the ground while the names were read off of African Americans who have died in confrontations with police. The overnight curfew imposed by Mayor Joe Hogsett came after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, has sparked protests nationwide. Shortly after the curfew took effect Sunday night, police Chief Randal Taylor urged protesters during a news conference to return home in compliance with the mayor's order. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. ""Go home for yourself, go home for your family, go home for your city,"" Taylor said. ""There is nothing you will prove tonight by violating this order."" Two people died amid several shootings late Saturday and early Sunday, though it wasn't clear their deaths were related to the protests. Police said no officers had fired their guns. One of those fatally shot was Chris Beaty, who was a defensive lineman on Indiana University's football team from 2000 to 2004 and has recently managed Indianapolis nightclubs, The Indianapolis Star reported. Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting Saturday night a few blocks from downtown Indianapolis' Monument Circle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Young said the circumstances of Beaty's fatal shooting remained under investigation. ""It's still early on in the investigation and I don't believe we have any suspects at this point. We have very limited information,"" he said Monday morning. Beaty recently launched Worldwide Masks — a company that sells one-piece face coverings to prevent the spread of germs, with fellow entrepreneur Joe Babish, The Indianapolis Star reported. Large protests happened elsewhere in Indiana on Saturday, with police in Hammond using tear gas to break up protesters and officers blocking marchers from going onto Interstate 80/94. Fort Wayne police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd after Friday night's demonstration resulted in some protesters throwing rocks at officers and breaking dozens of windows on downtown businesses.

For several journalists across the country, the demonstrations were taking an ominous, dangerous turn. A television reporter in Columbia, S.C., was hurt by a thrown rock Saturday and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. A television news photographer in Pittsburgh said he was beaten by demonstrators, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew. Fox's Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. ""We took a good thumping,"" he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington's Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew's equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn't answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. ""The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,"" he said, ""and that was a very different feeling."" He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, ""Fox News hates Muslims."" A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert's microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, ""I can't breathe,"" a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was ""extremely grateful"" to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini's camera was smashed. ""They were putting themselves at risk,"" he said. ""It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,"" he said. ""I'm proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We're going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we're doing."" Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. ""We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,"" Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was damaged later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo. Ian Smith, a photographer for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, said that he was attacked by protesters who stomped and kicked him at a demonstration there. Smith, who said other protesters jumped in to save him, posted a picture on Twitter showing him with a bruised face and bloody hand. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, ""I've been shot! I've been shot!"" and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. Two Associated Press photographers have been hit by projectiles while documenting protests, one in Minneapolis on Thursday and another in Los Angeles on Friday. Neither was seriously injured. Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. Rocks were thrown and Miranda Parnell, a television reporters from WIS-TV, was injured and taken to the hospital, according to a tweet from network anchor Judi Gatson. It was not clear who threw the rock that hit Parnell. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. Later Saturday night, a CNN crew said some of its members were hit with rubber bullets.",0.0

President Donald Trump spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge ""law and order"" and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. ""He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,"" said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. ""America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it."" Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America's systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden. There are some signs that Biden is looking to take on a more active role. On Sunday, his campaign released a photo of him visiting the site of protests in Wilmington. Biden, wearing a mask to protect from COVID-19, knelt down to talk to a man and a young child. ""The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,"" Biden wrote in a message attached to the photo. ""And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen."" On Monday, Biden plans to venture out again to meet with community leaders in Wilmington. Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. ""What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,"" she said. ""We're going to discuss ideas and make recommendations."" Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his ""Plan for Black America,"" an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. ""I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. ""There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.""",0.0

Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. ___ LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are ""very concerning."" James Slack said Monday that ""journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence."" He said the violence of the past few nights was ""very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully."" Slack said ""the footage of George Floyd's death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected."" Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said ""we would hope and expect justice to be done."" ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city's curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. ___ SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. ___ PARIS — In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday's protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore's sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation ""at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd."" She said ""they had the same words, their last words: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'"" She denounced the latest medical experts' report as ""racist"" and ""untrue."" The family wants the officers in charge of Traore's arrest to go on trial. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico's largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, ""Say his name: George Floyd"" and ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be ""different."" When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by ""different,"" he said: ""A general never gives out his tactics."" ___ SYDNEY — Fearful of conflict, organizers have canceled a peaceful protest planned for Sydney over the death of George Floyd in the United States. A rally planned at Sydney's downtown Hyde Park for Tuesday was canceled on Monday after people threatened to create ""havoc and protest against the event,"" an organizer said on social media. The rally was presented as a peaceful protest against the overrepresentation of indigenous Australians in Australia's criminal justice system as well as in solidarity for Floyd who was ""brutally and inhumanly murdered."" Organizers posted that ""although Australia is far from where the murder took place, we have a voice."" Thousands of protesters are expected at similar rallies planned for the Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide on Saturday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB on Monday ""there's no need to import things ... happening in other countries here to Australia,"" referring to U.S. riots. ___ TEHRAN, Iran — In Iran, which has in the recent past violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi urged the U.S. government and police to stop the violence against their own people during a press conference in Tehran on Monday. ""To American officials and police! Stop violence against your people and let them breathe,"" Mousavi said and also sent a message to the American people that ""the world is standing with you."" He added that Iran is saddened to see ""the violence the U.S. police have recently"" set off. ___ BEIJING — Chinese state media has weighed in on the protests in the U.S., comparing them to last year's violent anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong that Beijing accuses the U.S. and other foreign forces as encouraging. In an editorial Sunday, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might ""think twice"" before commenting again on issues in Hong Kong, knowing that ""their words might backfire on them one day."" That followed a commentary on state broadcaster CCTV Saturday that described the violence between police and protesters in the U.S. as ""cup of bitter wine distilled by the U.S. politicians themselves."" Racism, the commentary said, is the ""darkest shadow on American history and the scar that will not heal."" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the protests in various American cities ""once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems."" China hopes the U.S. will ""safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities,"" Zhao said at a daily briefing on Monday The protests are an opportunity for China to allege double-standards and counter criticism from foreign governments and the Western media over its handling of the Hong Kong protests, its treatment of Muslim minorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang and other human rights issues. ___ SAN FRANCISCO — The state Department of Human Resources sent a directive to close all California state buildings ""with offices in downtown city areas"" on Monday, a sweeping mandate that covers everything from Department of Motor Vehicles offices to those that license workers and provide health care. ""After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,"" said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. ""Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,"" the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ BOSTON — A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when protesters clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit had been called in to help quell the clashes. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence ""criminal and cowardly"" in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrations marching peacefully. ___ SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters ""harshly condemned"" a white police officer's ""lawless and brutal murder"" of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting ""No justice, no peace."" It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as ""I can't breathe"" and ""The Real Virus is Racism."" Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ",0.0

Many people around the world have watched with growing unease at the civil unrest in the U.S. after the latest in a series of police killings of black men and women. Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck until he stopped breathing. The officer was fired and charged with murder. The protesters in Auckland marched to the U.S. Consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans like ""I can't breathe"" and ""The real virus is racism."" Hundreds more joined the peaceful protests and vigils elsewhere in New Zealand, where Monday was a public holiday.

He also told the American people that ""the world is standing with you."" He added that Iran is saddened to see ""the violence the U.S. police have recently"" set off. At a gathering in central London on Sunday, thousands offered support for American demonstrators, chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words ""How many more?"" In other places, too, demonstrators wove solidarity with the U.S. protesters with messages aimed at local authorities. In Brazil, hundreds of people protested crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio de Janeiro's working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. Police used tear gas to disperse them, with some demonstrators saying ""I can't breathe,"" repeating Floyd's own words. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. Police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. In authoritarian nations, the unrest became a chance to undermine U.S. criticism of their own situations. Iranian state television repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems. And state-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong's anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing ""their words might backfire."" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters ""harshly condemned"" a white policeman's ""lawless and brutal murder"" of a black citizen. It printed three large photos of protest scenes from recent days in the city where Floyd was killed. The article said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting ""No justice, no peace,"" and that demonstrations were occurring in other cities and were expected to grow. It did not make any direct comments about the Trump administration.",0.0

Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said Monday that after a review of the cases, he has decided not to file charges against 41 nonviolent protesters arrested on Friday and Saturday. “We will not file criminal charges against those who came downtown to stand against injustice and make their voices heard through peaceful demonstrations,” Mears stated. “For us, the unfortunate choices by a few will not dilute the critical message carried by the majority.” Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Randal Taylor said Monday that the arrests were valid but the decision to file charges is up to Mears. ""Prosecutor Mears and I have a good relationship and if there was concern on our part, we would certainly talk with him,"" he said. Two people were killed during the violent unrest that followed peaceful demonstrations held Downtown earlier on Saturday and scores of businesses were vandalized in incidents which included broken windows, graffiti and stolen property.

1622569271,2020-06-01 13:00:53,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://decaturdailydemocrat.com/content/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-running-mate,en,True,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, mayors, police brutality and misconduct",175953,decaturdailydemocrat.com,http://decaturdailydemocrat.com/,"By ALEXANDRA JAFFE and BILL BARROW Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a ""transition"" candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. ""The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden's campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. ""Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward.” Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. ""It doesn't really matter what I think,"" she said. ""What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks."" Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. ""As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?"" Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring ""you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution."" ""And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,"" she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. ""Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,"" he said. ""I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same."" Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. ""This is very tough timing for her,"" said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden's running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has ""proliferated."" ""The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,"" he said. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. ""It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,"" said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair.",0.0

Protesters had earlier asked police to put down their batons and come join them on their walk. That walk with officers and protesters occurred shortly after 9 p.m. Some type of nonlethal bullets appeared to be fired shortly about 8:43 p.m. After that exchange, police called forward a man to talk with them. The man then returned to the crowd of protesters. Then, protesters started shouting, “Hands up. Don’t shoot.” Protesters also chanted, “Say his name / Dreasjon Reed.” Reed was shot and killed by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in May after a pursuit that was aired on Facebook Live. Protesters have been told a representative from the Indianapolis mayor’s office will meet with them to hear their concerns. Shortly before 10 p.m., IMPD issued a statement on Twitter: “We were so proud to see officers and protestors march together in solidarity. Our officers will continue to ensure the safety of demonstrators as they walk back to their cars to travel home. Our thanks to the protestors for peacefully advocating for change.” Returning home, the protesters about 10:20 p.m. passed in front of the WISH-TV station on Meridian Street on their way home. Shortly before 11 p.m., Mayor Joe Hogsett issued this statement: “At this pivotal moment in our country’s history, it is critical that we preserve the right to have voices of change be heard – and that we listen. Tonight, I was proud to watch a moving example of what that can look like. “We have a long, difficult road ahead if we are to address decades of mistrust and create meaningful change. In joining arms, these peaceful protestors and their police department came together to take a small step forward. It was an inspiring reminder of what makes Indianapolis a special place to call home. “I want to thank the men and women of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, as well as the Indiana State Police, for their continued hard work, as well as the advocacy of those who peacefully and powerfully made their voices heard today.” Below is video from the encounter with police and protesters.

(WISH Photo) (WISH Photo) (WISH Photo) (WISH Photo) (WISH Photo) (WISH Photo) Mayor Hogsett: ‘serious concerns’ about use of force with protesters Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a news conference Monday that he has “serious concerns” about some of the interactions between officers and protesters from this weekend. He said he expects to investigate if those actions were within policy, and that the city has plans to make changes to its police review board. “Our use-of-force review board will have jurisdiction over nonlethal incidents such as we saw yesterday, and that board will have significant civilian participation in the process. That is a step in the right direction. But, those reviews will take time, and I know it will be frustrating for some. It’s frustrating for me, but I do believe that time will allow for a full review of whether these actions were within policy.” The mayor said he has also called on Randal Taylor, chief of Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, to propose an update to guidelines on how police use force within the next two weeks. Taylor said IMPD is reviewing an incident caught on video of people being arrested during the curfew. He also is reviewing the use of tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters. News 8’s Richard Essex caught some video of force being used on people Sunday night along Ohio Street outside the Salesforce Tower. News 8 also caught tear gas being used on protesters Sunday. Taylor apologized to anyone inadvertently impacted by the tear gas. Taylor deferred to Josh Baker, IMPD deputy chief, to answer questions about operations by the department. “We did not lose control. I don’t think that that’s an appropriate characterization. Now obviously we were all down here, and there were times where officers were scrambling to reassess situations in a very rapid manner, and it looked like there was some disorganization on our part. However, there was clear communications with the command center and we were redeploying those resources as rapidly as possible, not only to monitor the riotous crowds but to answer the calls for services and the calls for assistance that were coming in throughout the downtown area.” A replay of the news conference can be view in a post on the WISH-TV Facebook page. The mayor had earlier Monday announced Marion County will be under curfew for the second night in a row. Peaceful protest on Monday afternoon Around noon Monday, peaceful protesters near Indianapolis City Market silently protesting while raising signs. Many of them later headed to Monument Circle and began chanting. There were at least 100 protesters who marched to the Statehouse and around downtown. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers were on foot and their patrol cars blocked off streets and monitored the area. Protesters circled back to Monument Circle to hear words from organizers. News 8’s Aleah Hordges read one sign that mentioned how the city can enforce a curfew but not change, and how that’s the problem. Many protesters have said that they’re disappointed that IMPD has been using obsessive force and throwing tear gas during the peaceful protests over the weekend, but it’s not stopping them from demanding justice. Protester Aaron Smith said, “It is definitely way long overdue. There’s been countless examples of people who have succumb to police brutality and violence. We’re sick of it. It’s time that we act real lasting change and that’s why we’re out here.” People protest peacefully on the afternoon of June 1, 2020, in downtown Indianapolis.

Marion County announces 8 p.m. curfew for Monday night Marion County will be under curfew for the second night in a row. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced a one-day extension of the curfew on Monday. The order begins at 8 p.m. Monday and goes to 4 a.m. Tuesday. “I am proud of our residents, the vast majority of whom abided by Sunday night’s curfew order,” said Mayor Hogsett said in a statement. “My thanks go out to the men and women who helped keep Indianapolis peaceful overnight. Throughout our history, the most basic mechanism for systemic change has been the ballot box. At a time ripe with the potential to change our institutions and empower the will of the people, tomorrow presents a powerful opportunity for residents to make their voices heard through the exercise of their constitutional right to vote. Today I am reinstating the curfew order to ensure we can preserve and protect that right.” Exceptions to the order: Travel directly to or from work Those seeking medical care Those “fleeing from dangerous circumstances” Law enforcement; News media Federal, state or local public officials “conducting necessary work” Homeless individuals Election-related activities Hogsett announced a curfew for Sunday night after rioting on Friday and Saturday nights. As part of the curfew, Indiana State Police will again close some interstate ramps downtown starting at 7 p.m. Those include I-70 westbound to Fletcher, Ohio and Michigan streets; I-65 southbound to Fletcher, Ohio and Michigan streets; I-65 northbound to Washington Street; and I-65 northbound and southbound to Dr. Marling Luther King Jr. Drive. WIBC, a newsgathering partner of WISH-TV, reported about 5:15 p.m. that two of the ramps were already closed: Exit 116 for I-65 southbound to King Drive, and I-65/70 collector exit to East Street. Carmel to sue Minneapolis to recover protection expenses Carmel’s mayor announced Monday the city plans to sue Minneapolis for negligence so the Hamilton County city can recover expenses for protecting itself as a result of police actions in Minnesota. Then he backed down a few hours later. Mayor James Brainard initially said in a news release, “but for the negligence of the police department in that city, many communities, including Carmel, would not have incurred the costs of responding to the resulting riots and looting.” Brainard said in the initial release that the city has hired outside counsel for the case. He also asked other cities to join Carmel in its lawsuit. “Those in power need to understand the far-reaching consequences of their actions,” Brainard said in the initial release. Carmel Mayor James Brainard has decided to put his idea to sue Minneapolis on hold. He issued this statement in a post on Facebook about 8:30 p.m.: “After some additional consideration, I have decided to put on hold the idea of a lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis. I still feel that the Minneapolis Police Department was recklessly negligent, given the officer’s disciplinary history, in allowing him to remain in uniform patrolling the streets of Minneapolis. My intent was to send a message that their negligence cost many lives and millions in property damage across the country. “America has a long history of correcting behavior though the legal system and I felt this would be another opportunity to do so. “This is not about inflicting more pain to the good people of Minneapolis. It is about sending a message to its leaders and to leaders of across the U.S. that we will no longer tolerate the violence and damage that results from their inability or unwillingness to treat all people with respect.

Whiteland police: no threats in town Whiteland Police Department in Johnson County tweeted at 6:39 p.m., “At this time there is no threat to any resident or business in town.

Ball State president to walk with students, faculty Ball State University’s president, Geoffrey S. Mearns, said in a post on Facebook that he will “walk in solidarity” with students, faculty and staff, and friends and neighbors on Thursday evening. “People all across our country and all around the world have expressed outrage at this most recent manifaestation of racial injustice. I share those sentiments, and I condemn the actions of the police officers who killed Mr. Floyd.” Gov. Holcomb speaks about violence, plans ahead Gov. Eric Holcomb spoke Monday afternoon in a virtual news conference from the State House. Holcomb said peacefully protesting is noble and protected by the First Amendment. “I hope the peacemakers continue to express themselves and not allow their message to be overwhelmed by the troublemakers seeking to administer pain on the innocent.” Holcomb also said the time for discussions and town halls are over. “We must harness, not squander the energy generated in the aftermath of the Floyd injustice by creating a to-do list and prescribe those action steps that address better health care access, affordable housing, educational opportunity, job training and placement, urban economic development, access to capital, and, yes, criminal justice reform as well as policing standards, and race relations for those disproportionately affected.” The entire news conference from Gov.

A crowd of protesteres marched through the city on Sunday starting around 6 p.m. local time. The mayor shared the following statement: “As a nation and in our community, we have witnessed and shared in the grief over the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. We also have seen the protests and sometimes violence and destruction that has occurred in some cities. I was notified by our Police Chief, Dion Campbell, of a planned peaceful protest scheduled for Sunday at 6:00 pm. Our Police Chief and his staff prepared for this event and developed a strategy to have a peaceful protest with minimal incident. I spent the afternoon and evening at the M.C. Police Station and was kept informed of what was happening in our City. As your Mayor, I would like to personally acknowledge Chief Dion Campbell and his staff at the Michigan City Police Department along with the countless assisting agencies and staff including the Indiana State Police, Sheriff John Boyd, and the LaPorte County Sheriff’s Department, along with Trail Creek and Long Beach Police Departments, Michigan City Fire Department, LaPorte County 911, and our LaPorte County Emergency Medical Service. I could not be prouder of the men and women that put themselves and our City ahead of everything else to insure a safe, peaceful protest. I want to thank the demonstrators who peacefully exercised their right to free speech. The protest was motivated by a desire for justice, equality, and accountability in the United States. I am angered and disappointed though by the individuals who chose to engage in unnecessary acts of violence and destruction, which undermined the true meaning of the protest. In these unpredicted times, we must all work together to achieve change. Again, my thanks and appreciation to Chief Campbell for his courageous leadership and the unselfish dedication of the men and women of the Michigan City Police Department and all the assisting agencies.”",0.0

He grew up in Indianapolis, went to Cathedral High School, played college football at Indiana from 2000 to 2003 and has been a vibrant part of the Indianapolis community ever since. But over the weekend he was killed during the violence in downtown Indianapolis that started as a protest over the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis. The news of Beaty's death has shattered many people in and around the state. He was loved that way. ***** BREAKING NEWS: Reliving the final moments of Chris Beaty's life. CLICK HERE ****** According to police reports, Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting reported shortly before midnight on Satuday at Talbot and Vermont streets. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Beaty was one of two people killed that night in downtown Indianapolis in separate incidents. Indianapolis police confirmed Sunday to the Indianapolis Star that one arrest has been made in connection to the fatal shootings, but officials did not say which shooting the suspect was involved in. Indiana football coach Tom Allen released on statement on Beaty late Monday morning. It read: ""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating. Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me, and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana football energized me every time we were together. ""He was one of our first alumni that displayed his unwavering support for what we are building here at Indiana and how we are building it. I am so heartbroken for his family and he will be deeply missed by all those that were blessed to call him a friend. #LEO Beaty's head coach during his first two years at Indiana, Cam Cameron, also sent out a message on how much he cared for his defensive lineman. ""... I think I can speak for everyone in our locker room as well as Indiana University that we all loved Chris. Chris was a great person and teammate, a leader, someone who always put others, black or white, before himself. ""Unfortunately, from what I've been told, it cost him his life as he was returning home from helping someone else get home safely during the riots before he was shot. He was everything we as Hoosiers hope to inspire in others. ""As a Hoosier myself, it saddens me to know we have lost one of the great young men from our own state, someone who stood for everything we as Hoosiers believe is right. ... Chris, we love you and will miss you. God's blessings.'' Beaty was a popular promoter who always had things going on in and around town during the city's biggest events every year. He was just on television two weeks ago, being interviewed for a story on fashionable masks that one of his companies was involved in producing. Beaty loved being in and around the Indiana football program, too. Many of his recent tweets were about IU football. He was a defensive lineman for Indiana during his four-year career with the Hoosiers. Beaty also had a big heart, and recently reached out to television personality Lindy Thackston, who's battling cancer right now. Beaty founded events promotion company Fresh Marketing in 2011. He was the past operating partner of Revel nightclub, general manager of Dunaway’s Palazzo Ossigeno and assistant general manager of 6 Lounge, according to reports. He also co-hosted online talk show “Digital Universe” with DJ GNO and Freddie Long. He graduated from Cathedral High School in 2000. Beaty played on the school’s football team, which won 4A state championships in 1996, 1998 and 1999.  Former IU basketball standout Eric Gordon tweeted about Beaty overnight: “R.I.P. Chris Beaty. Was a great guy, we had some good times at IU. You will be truly missed bro.” With fellow entrepreneur Joe Babish, Beaty recently launched Worldwide Masks — a company that sells one-piece face coverings to prevent the spread of germs. The Indiana football program tweeted out a note of condolence on Monday morning as well. Related stories on Indiana football",0.0

Terre Haute Police Chief Shawn Keen said they’re focused on being transparent with the community. “I wasn’t sure of the value in this honestly early on when we talked about this, throughout the weekend and even just a little bit ago I’ve gotten questions from the protesters questions about how we do things. I even got a letter from the Inter-Faith council asking about our reporting efforts as far as bias based crimes. So clearly we haven’t answered all those questions for all those people,” Keen said. Both Terre Haute Police Department and Vigo Co. Sheriff’s office both conduct crisis and deescalation training for all their officers and deputies. The police department is also working on implementing the use of body cameras. Chief Keen said there is an open door policy in place for citizens that would like to make a complaint or ask a question. “These are some things that’s been made clear to me that a lot of the general public doesn’t know that we do. We wanted to take this opportunity to get this out there to people so that they understand that. As always if you have any complaint, if you have any concerns, you can call here,” he said. John Plasse, Vigo Co. Sheriff, said law enforcement officials are always looking for feedback from the community on how to become better. “Anything that we can do or participate in to make sure that we have the public’s trust, we will look at that and see what we can do to make it better. Again, without our community’s support we can’t be effective in what we do,” Plasse said.",0.0

""I did see a lot of masks,"" Tippecanoe County Health Department Administrator Khala Hochstedler said Monday morning when asked about the risks of a COVID-19 spike among those who attended Sunday evening's protest in downtown. Many people wore masks — some didn't — and thousands stood shoulder to shoulder outside of Lafayette government buildings and police offices. They shouted their anger at how Minneapolis resident George Floyd died on May 25 with a police officer's knee on his neck without regard to the COVID-19 virus that shuttered the nation's businesses and economy for two months.

(Photo: Nikos Frazier | Journal & Courier) There wasn't a lot of social distancing, though, Hochstedler observed. “It was outdoors, so that helps,” she said. “We’ll just have to watch in the next two weeks and see what happens.” Dr. James Bien, IU Health Arnett's chief medical officer, attended the protests with his family to lend their voices to the outrage against Floyd's death. They wore masks and had hand sanitizer. “It does make me concerned that we could have some transmission last night,” he said. But also worrying Bien is a possible spread of the virus from the parties and larger gatherings that he noticed since the state started easing the stay-at-home orders — especially this past weekend when the temperatures were pleasant and the skies were sunny and clear. “There might be no impact,"" Dr. Dan Wickers, vice president of medical affairs for Franciscan Health Lafayette, said noting that the area's COVID-19 infection rate is low, so perhaps no one in the crowd of protesters carried the virus. On the other hand, perhaps there were people in the crowd who are infected and asymptomatic or have not yet shown symptoms. They might be ""super spreaders,"" meaning they'll pass the virus along to many people who, in turn, carry the virus home to family and friends, Wickert said. “No way to know if that occurred except in retrospect, and then it’s too late,” Wickert said. Since the middle of March, people have been advised to call their doctor's office if they feel sick. That's still the best thing to do, Bien said. “They’ll advise you what the next step will be based on your health condition and risks,” Bien said. No one wants to interfere with people's right to have their voices heard, Wickert said. But if there are more protests, he suggests wearing a mask — making sure it covers both the mouth and the nose. Protesters should social distance as much as possible and sanitize their hands. “We have done very well here, and we don’t want to see that go backwards,” Wickert said.

Tippecanoe County Sheriff Bob Goldsmith said he gave the order Sunday night to mobilize officers – who had largely been on the periphery of the first four hours of a largely peaceful demonstration – around the Tippecanoe County Courthouse and from perches above to start clearing crowds. Buy Photo Smoke is fired as protesters rally outside the Tippecanoe County Courthouse, Sunday, May 31, 2020 in Lafayette. Protesters marched in response to the police involved killing of George Floyd. (Photo: Nikos Frazier | Journal & Courier) Goldsmith said that came after he personally tried to negotiate with people who were spray painting graffiti on the courthouse walls, breaking glass, sending concrete pavers through a set of doors and setting off some sort of explosive near the courthouse’s Columbia Street entrance. Those in the crowd said the tear gas, dropped from a third-floor courthouse balcony, came without warning. J&C reporters on the scene did not hear a call for the crowd to disperse, either. “That was some bull----,” William Finnessey said as he retreated from the courthouse square, wiping his eyes while standing on South Street. He said he’d come from Kokomo to be part of the demonstration and had been joining a chant of, “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” when the crowd started to run. “They did it in Indianapolis. Now the cops are doing it here.” His reference to Indianapolis took in what turned out to be three nights of demonstrations that devolved into confrontations with police, complete with rounds of tear gas, looting and, by Sunday, an evening curfew. Goldsmith said Greater Lafayette police agencies had hoped to keep a low profile during an event that was scheduled to start at 8 p.m. but was in full throat before 7 p.m. And for the early part of the evening – given to taking over downtown streets to march, chant and hold up signs dedicated to George Floyd, a Minnesota man killed last week while his neck was pinned to the ground by a police officer – police stayed clear. More: Protests in Lafayette Sunday largely peaceful; police use tear gas after march Goldsmith said the tone changed by 10:30 p.m., as those remaining took to the courthouse steps on the Columbia Street side. Goldsmith said the crowd was younger, louder and “very aggressive, to honest with you.” The sheriff said he was watching from inside the courthouse until he had reports of spray painting. He said he and another officer went outside to talk, but he said he determined things were getting out of control. “I looked at the other officer and said, ‘Let’s go back in, we’re done,’” Goldsmith said. “I called on the radio, ‘Let’s start the process to shut this down. This has gone beyond spray painting.’” Tear gas coming down Columbia Street as Police mobilized around courthouse.

He said people came back and started throwing rocks and pavers. He said that seconds later, an explosion, loud and bright, went off just outside the courthouse doors. Goldsmith said he was sure people would think the explosion came from a piece of police equipment – “but it didn’t.” RAW VIDEO: Warning, explicit content CLOSE This was the scene Sunday, May 31, 2020, as protesters threw rocks, pavers and an explosive at the Tippecanoe County Courthouse as a rally to protest police brutality turned to chaos. Lafayette Journal & Courier Hakeem Bryant Twyman, a Lafayette resident and a photographer, was at the courthouse taking pictures and video as the chaos started. Earlier he said he watched an African-American woman confront a white man who was carrying a sack of bricks. Twyman said the explanation she received: The man shrugged and said he had the bricks “to protect all of you.” Twyman shared a video with the J&C of mainly white people throwing objects at the courthouse doors, punctuated by a man in a light blue bandanna lighting what appears to be a long, red explosive and dropping it at the courthouse entrance. Twyman stopped shooting when he realized he needed to move. “That night, it was very, very beautiful, the camaraderie and all that, up until right then,” Twyman said. “At these protests, I feel people are trying to do these peacefully. I feel people are taking advantage of what’s going on and trying to live out their fantasies or their anarchy ideas they have in their mind. … That’s what I saw last night.” After the explosion, Goldsmith said police started dropping canisters with oleoresin capsicum – similar to pepper spray – from the third-floor balcony. By then, Lafayette police stationed near Fourth and Columbia streets had gathered and fired tear gas cannisters into the crowd. Police spent the next several hours pushing crowds off the courthouse square, using tear gas in surrounding blocks to do it. On Monday, Goldsmith said his investigators were investigating a possible shot fired through a third-floor window, where a deputy had been stationed. As of early Monday afternoon, Lafayette police were still compiling damages, arrests and potentially related incidents across the city from late Sunday and early Monday, Lt. Matt Gard said. Gard said police pushed back an attempt to loot a Best Buy store on Sagamore Parkway. There were several dumpster fires in downtown alleys, he said. Police suspect at fire was set to a business on South Earl Avenue. And glass was shattered at a couple of downtown businesses, including a large pane at a Purdue Federal Credit Union branch at Fourth and Main streets, across from the courthouse. Gard said police responded to false reports of other looting, too. Who was the blame in each case wasn’t immediately clear early Monday afternoon. Tippecanoe County commissioners closed the county courthouse Monday so crews could assess damage and make repairs to the 19th century building. County Commissioner Tracy Brown said Monday morning that the glass doors at the main entrance off Columbia Street were “pretty much destroyed.” Glass was broken in a first-floor window on the Main Street side of the courthouse. And there was the hole in a third-floor window that Brown said police were investigating. The courthouse also had anti-police graffiti painted Sunday night, as a demonstration meant to call out police brutality went from peaceful marches for the first four hours to confrontations with police that continued into the early morning hours. Brown said the initial plan had been to close the courthouse until 1 p.m. Monday. But county officials decided by 9 a.m. to close for the day.

It was different when it got back downtown. When did it go from that to what it became? … Heartbroken is the only thing I can say.” Gard made similar comments, saying that demonstrators did a good job early in the evening to corral people who tried to instigating things. “It was the few left behind at the end of the night who were the problem,” Gard said. Goldsmith said police from Greater Lafayette agencies planned to meet Monday afternoon to address the potential for more unrest in the coming nights. He said police had heard no concrete plans that that would happen. “We’re hoping that was it,” Goldsmith said. “But we plan to be ready if it wasn’t.” Reach Dave Bangert at 765-420-5258 or at dbangert@jconline.com.

Protests due to the recent death of George Floyd took place in Bellevue in addition to Seattle, with looting in Bellevue and at least one burned automobile there. (Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images) (CNN) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he’d support laws criminalizing flag burning, saying in a call with governors that it’s time for the Supreme Court to take up the issue again as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd. Trump’s comments follow nearly a week of protests across the country that at times have turned violent over the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis. During the protests in some cities, people have vandalized buildings and looters have ransacked businesses. In Atlanta, protesters burned an American flag in front of CNN headquarters and photographers have captured images of flag burnings in Los Angeles and Washington state in recent days. Trump, who as a candidate in 2016 proposed jail time or loss of citizenship for burning the American flag, called the act a “disgrace” on Monday and pledged support for an “anti-flag burning” statute. “We have a different court and I think that it’s time that we review that again. Because when I see flags being burned — they wanted to crawl up flag poles in Washington and try and burn flags but we stopped them,” the President told governors, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. “They’re weren’t able to do it. They would’ve done it if we didn’t stop them. I think it’s time to relook at that issue, hopefully the Supreme Court will accept that.” He continued: “If you wanted to try to pass a very powerful flag burning statute again — anti-flag burning, I hope you’ll do it because we’ll back you 100% all the way. Okay? I hope some of you do it.” Back in 1989, the court divided 5-4 on the issue holding that a demonstrators’ conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment. The case concerned a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Trump has repeatedly praised, sided with the majority that ruled, “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Scalia spoke about the matter in a 2012 interview with CNN, saying that while he did not approve of flag burning, it is fundamentally protected by the Constitution and the Founding Fathers’ efforts to create a government not ruled by tyranny. “If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged — and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government,” Scalia said. “That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.” And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, wrote a 2006 op-ed for the Central Kentucky News titled “Flag stands for freedom, even to desecrate,” in which he defended the right to burn the flag. “No act of speech is so obnoxious that it merits tampering with our First Amendment. Our Constitution, and our country, is stronger than that,” he wrote. “Ultimately, people like that pose little harm to our country. But tinkering with our First Amendment might.” Still, banning flag-burning has drawn mainstream support before. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was supported at the time by President George H.W. Bush, before it was ruled unconstitutional, and the Flag Protection Act of 2005, another failed attempt to criminalize flag burning, was co-sponsored by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.",0.0

(Video courtesy WHAS11) Louisville Courier Journal LOUISVILLE, Ky. — In the end, it was one mistake too many for embattled Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad. On Monday afternoon, Mayor Greg Fischer fired Conrad, effective immediately, after learning that officers at the fatal shooting of popular eatery owner David McAtee did not have their body cameras turned on. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" said Fischer, who later added that ""an immediate change in leadership is required."" Both LMPD officers and National Guard soldiers fired their weapons early Monday morning, killing McAtee, the owner of YaYa's BBQ in western Louisville, after officials said someone shot at LMPD officers from a parking lot at 26th and Broadway. The incident is under state, federal and local police investigation. Conrad, who served as chief for eight years, had said last month he would retire at the end of June amid increasing pressure in the wake of a different fatal police shooting: that of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician who was killed March 13 in her apartment. But Fischer said it had become clear in recent days that the city could not wait for a change in leadership. Read more: Investigation launched into fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner CLOSE People say they're ""angry"" and ""want justice"" after popular a barbecue restaurant owner, David McAtee, was shot and killed Monday by law enforcement. Louisville Courier Journal He relieved Conrad of his duties and put Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder in charge as interim police chief after finding out that the officers had not activated their body cameras at the McAtee shooting, violating policy that has been the subject of much scrutiny in recent weeks. There is no body camera footage of the fatal shooting of McAtee or Taylor. The officers in the Taylor case were not required to wear body cameras because they were in the Criminal Interdiction Unit. The city has since revised that policy. Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that Conrad's firing ""had to happen."" ""Two incidences of this significance, no body cameras — it had to happen,"" Beshear said. ""It was the right move."" Council President David James, D-6th District, a frequent critic of the chief, said he was saddened ""that it took this much calamity in our city to remove the chief of police."" Fischer's decision to remove Conrad from office brings to an end several turbulent years for the former chief, who led a department through scandals and a skyrocketing homicide rate. His retirement announcement in mid-May said it had been the ""highlight of my professional career to be Louisville's police chief."" A spokeswoman for the department had said at the time that the mayor had not asked Conrad to resign. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, business owner, killed by authorities On Monday, however, Fischer made clear that he had immediately removed Conrad of his duties. Despite the firing, Conrad will still receive payment for any days earned and will still have his pension, Fischer said. Earlier in the day, Beshear had called for camera footage — ""body camera and otherwise"" — from the incident to be released so that Kentuckians could ""see for themselves"" whether the actions taken by law enforcement were justified or cause for more concern. It's not clear when he was made aware that Louisville Metro Police officers on scene were not recording body camera footage. In an evening press briefing, Beshear said he hopes that Louisville protesters see that ""steps are being taken"" and that they know he recognizes some of the facts that have come out about McAtee's fatal shooting were ""not acceptable."" ""Before people can have trust that we will work for change, they've got to see that things make you mad, too,"" he said. ""… People need to know that you care, that you're vested, that you're committed to doing what's right. ""Now is a chance to get things right. And I hope those tonight can believe in that sincerity and can give us that opportunity."" Ryan Nichols, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police representing Louisville Metro Police officers, said he didn't know all of Fischer's specific reasons for firing Conrad but said he doubts it will be a ""magic bullet"" to quell protesters. ""If it helps in any way, then that's good,"" Nichols said. Outcry over the fatal police shooting of Taylor has rocked Louisville in recent weeks and, since Thursday, has led to nightly protests with hundreds of people flocking to downtown streets to demand justice. Scrutiny on city leaders and police has led to several policy changes, including expanded body camera requirements and the suspension of no-knock warrants.

Louisville Courier Journal Criminal charges against Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were dismissed, pending further investigation. And Fischer has called for a civilian review board of the police department to have subpoena powers. But apparent violations of policy in yet another fatal police shooting proved a bridge too far for Fischer's loyalty to Conrad, who weathered several high-profile scandals. The Louisville native began with the Louisville Police Department as a patrol officer in 1980, rising to assistant chief in what later became Louisville Metro Police, before leaving to head the police force in Glendale, Arizona. He took over as chief of Louisville Metro Police in 2012. During his tenure, he was praised for some transparency efforts, but support eroded amid a spiking murder rate. The Fraternal Order of Police and Louisville Metro Council cast no-confidence votes in his leadership in 2016 and 2017, respectively. On top of the homicides, the department faced scandals that included the revelation that officers had sexually assaulted teens in the department's youth Explorer Scout program. A report by a former U.S. attorney found ""violations of police and mistakes in judgment, some significant"" by department leaders. It also reported that Conrad aborted an investigation into one of the officers, allowing him to resign instead of be fired. More recently, amid the nationwide attention on the fatal police shooting of Taylor, Fischer's support of his chief flagged and he declined to say he had faith in Conrad's leadership. Before his firing, Conrad had planned to stay on as head of the agency through the end of the budget cycle. Under a restructuring, Schroeder will report to Amy Hess, the chief of public safety, rather than directly to Fischer.

After some additional consideration, I have decided to put on hold the idea of a lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis.

My intent was to send a message that their negligence cost many lives and millions in property damage across the country. America has a long history of correcting behavior though the legal system and I felt this would be another opportunity to do so. This is not about inflicting more pain to the good people of Minneapolis. It is about sending a message to its leaders and to leaders of across the U.S. that we will no longer tolerate the violence and damage that results from their inability or unwillingness to treat all people with respect. Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard ORIGINAL STORY: CARMEL, Ind.– Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard announced Monday his administration plans to take legal action against the City of Minneapolis for expenses accrued while protecting his city. “Communities across our nation are in turmoil, sparked by protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minnesota. First, let me make it very clear that I am outraged by the actions of Minnesota Police officer Derek Chauvin and the three other officers involved. In addition to firing the officers involved and charging Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter, the officers who stood by and took no action to save George Floyd should be charged with reckless homicide and the delay to do so is unacceptable,” said Brainard. Brainard said Carmel has retained outside legal counsel to take legal action against the City of Minneapolis “for negligence for the expenses incurred protecting our community as a result of the actions by police in Minneapolis.” If not for the negligence of the Minneapolis police, Brainard says many communities, including Carmel, wouldn’t have incurred costs of responding to the resulting riots and looting. “I encourage other cities to join us in this lawsuit for recovery of our costs. Those in power need to understand the far-reaching consequences of their actions,” said Brainard. “I understand the outrage felt across this nation and agree that we all need to work harder every day to fight the injustices that still exist. I am empathetic to those who want to publicly express themselves and we will take every step necessary to protect those who want to voice their opinions. What the majority of the protestors are marching for is right, but the violence that has occurred is not. Brainard said there were messages posted on social media encouraging people to protest and destroy areas of Carmel. Those messages prompted him to quadruple the amount of officers to patrol on Saturday. The evening passed mostly peacefully, but Brainard said a few windows were broken at a Kohl’s store. “I want to also add my voice to Mayor Brainard’s and emphasize my disappointment toward the officers in Minnesota that led to the death of George Floyd. Police departments are there to protect and serve all members of their communities. That means all its residents, business owners, employees, visitors and public and private property. We train our officers and re-emphasize the importance of respect for the community. We rededicate ourselves to protecting the safety of those who want to express themselves, but will not hesitate to stop any illegal activities in our community,” said Carmel Police Chief Jim Barlow.

The City of Carmel said this was done to enable the city to take swift action against the threat of civil unrest if needed. “While we appreciate the freedom we have to peacefully assemble and voice our opinions, I will not allow these public sessions to become unlawful or endanger the lives and property of our community. Indiana law allows for mayors to declare a disaster, which includes the ‘imminent threat of widespread or severe damage, injury, or loss of life or property resulting from a human act.’ I am taking this action now to ensure that I have the legal authority and ability to take further action if necessary to protect this community. Given the threats that we have seen on social media, there may arise the need to limit access to certain areas of the city in order to keep our community safe and declaring a disaster emergency will allow me to do so,” said Mayor Jim Brainard.",0.0

The Oscar-winner called on his “Hollywood friends” to take action, advising them to get out of the comfort of their homes and let people see their faces. “You gotta get out here,” he implored. “You can’t sit back. You can’t tweet. You can’t text. You got to get out here.” He added, “When you’re here, and you see how people are hurting, you can understand what it is as opposed to being in your bedroom or your living room and saying, ‘Hey, I don’t like this.’” Foxx promised the crowd he would continue to show up for whatever they needed. “I don’t preach or anything like that,” he said. “But I just want to be here to let you know that you got somebody that you can call anytime.” He concluded by encouraging protesters to remain steadfast. “Let’s not forget that they may try to pull one on us,” he said. “Even now they say we didn’t see what we saw. And I continuously say, how can we see it as a murder and they see it as a misunderstanding? The work is still here.” The actor was joined at the peaceful protest by San Francisco Mayor London Breed, Supervisor Shamann Walton, officials from the NAACP and other leaders.

(Photo: DENNY SIMMONS / COURIER & PRESS, Denny Simmons) EVANSVILLE, Ind. — While remembering the more than 100,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19, community faith leaders on Monday also spoke about the racism and sense of injustice at the root of nationwide protests and riots. Those protests were ignited by the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man by Minneapolis police last week, while he was in officers' custody. It was, said the Rev. Adrian Brooks of Memorial Baptist Church, the latest injustice among many that have occurred time and again despite all that has been done to remedy racism in our country. Brooks and other speakers noted the disproportionate impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the African-American community. Buy Photo The Rev. Adrian Brooks offers his thoughts on both the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest following the death of George Floyd while in a Minneapolis policemen's custody during the Service of Remembrance and Hope at Temple B'Nai Israel Temple in Evansville Monday afternoon, June 1, 2020. (Photo: DENNY SIMMONS / COURIER & PRESS, Denny Simmons) ""It is also something to note that the demographic which I represent and of which I am a part has been disproportionately affected by this coronavirus that has affected our country,"" Brooks said. ""It has disproportionately affected our people, and it has also shown that racism within certain institutional sectors continues. And that has also facilitated some of the disproportionality of how this pandemic has affected us."" His remarks were part of a Service of Remembrance and Hope to honor the lives of those Americans who have died of Covid-19. Among them have been 36 residents of the Evansville-Henderson metropolitan area, including 2 in Vanderburgh County, 28 in Warrick County, 2 in Gibson County and 4 in Henderson County, Ky. The interfaith service was held at noon Monday at Temple Adath B’nai Israel in Evansville. In keeping with social distancing precautions to avoid spreading the coronavirus, it was not public but was streamed online for the public to watch on the First Presbyterian Facebook page and on Temple Adath B’nai’s Israel’s Livestream page. ""It is the duty of religious organizations to remember the dead and mourn their passing,"" said Rabbi Gary Mazo. He noted the past three months have been some of the deadliest in American history and that the pandemic has made it impossible for people to mourn their family and friends who have died. Added to that have been the frustrations of racial injustice, economic strain and isolation of social distancing and quarantining, Mazo said. ""We need to realize that our individual experiences of freedom, justice and peace are linked,"" he said. He said there needs to be a nationwide effort to acknowledge the pervasive racism in our nations and commit to resolving differences. ""We struggle as a human family to realize we are one family,"" said Omar Atia, representing the Islamic Society of Evansville. Our human fragility has been brought into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Sister Pat MaGuire of St. Benedict Cathedral. Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke summed everything up with one word — exhaustion. ""I don't know any institution, any individual, any social group that's not exhausted, initially by COVID and then, a week ago today, George Floyd was tragically killed. He should be alive today,"" Winnecke said. He said he was proud the Evansville community channeled its frustrations with a peaceful demonstration, rather than the violent protests and civil unrest in other cities. ""We can do better. We have to do better. We have to set a better example,"" Winnecke said. Brooks said he could understand the frustrations fueling the tumultuous protests. ""Here we are again having the same conversation, and I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated because we have marched. We have held forums. We've prayed. We've cried. And still, here we are in the same place after all this time. After all these lives that have been lost there are still segments in our communities that view me as less than a human,"" Brooks said. ""It is my hope and prayer that in this unsettling moment that we will emerge as a more loving, compassionate and culturally competent world.""

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: America's police officers are at the center of a national storm. They are hearing the rage over what happened to George Floyd at the same time they've been tasked with containing the violence. Some have been accused of cracking down on legitimate protesters, others criticized for being too permissive toward vandals and looters. To give us a sense of what the nation's police officers are thinking right now, we're joined by NPR's law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste, who's been talking with his police sources today. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: First, just give us a sense of the mood of the police officers that you're talking to. KASTE: The mood is gloomy. It's tense. And I think it's fair to say that there is some fear I've heard in some of the things I've heard from especially officers who are kind of on the front lines of crowd control and scenes we've seen so much in the last couple of days. There's also kind of a sense of frustration for a lot of officers when they hear what they think - what they perceive to be sort of a note of understanding or the sense that it's acceptable that this kind of violence, this looting and arson accompany these protests - they find that kind of frustrating. SHAPIRO: Are they angry just about the violence or also about the public response condemning the Minneapolis police involved in the death of George Floyd or, in some cases, about the actions of police officers that, you know, wear the badge as well? KASTE: Well, this anger I was talking about is about this violence. To be clear, when it comes to Minneapolis cops in that video, the police - it's actually struck me how unanimous they've been in condemning - from early on, from last week - condemning what they saw in that video. I've heard cops just going off on those Minneapolis police officers, saying they've made it so much harder to be a police officer in this country now. And you know, I was talking about this yesterday with Robert Hollis, who's a police patrol commander in Kent, Wash., which is a very diverse suburb of Seattle. And he told me that as a black man, he felt sick to his stomach watching that video of Floyd. But he also saw some reason for hope in this sort of widespread condemnation he was hearing from this world of policing. ROBERT HOLLIS: Numerous unions, numerous police chiefs are coming out and saying, this is not the type of officer that we want - 'cause I guarantee you five years ago, it would be more of a, let's wait and see what's going on. Let's hold off, wait for all the facts to come out. But this time, it was outcry from the get-go. SHAPIRO: And as an African American police officer, what is his take on the protesters' accusation that the police are inherently racist, that there are unfortunate trends and, you know, that it run through the institution? KASTE: Well, I mean, he took a nuanced approach to this when we were talking about it. You know, he said that policing, by its very nature, changes slowly. But he thinks, also, that in his 19 years as an officer, he has seen substantive improvements. One example he gave is his own department. A few years ago, they still permitted that knee-to-the-neck technique that we saw used on George Floyd. But a few years ago, a trainer said, this is dangerous. And the department banned it. And he also thinks the implicit bias training of just the last few years, the last five or six years has kind of shaped the views of the new generation of leaders inside of police departments, which may be behind this sort of unanimous condemnation we're hearing. But he still said that he understands that when people see something like this case with George Floyd, that they say, if one of you did it, you all did it. HOLLIS: I don't blame them. At the same time, I still would say to those community members, you need to keep working with us, and we want to keep - continue to keep working with you because we recognize that there's a need to change. We're doing our best to try and make those changes. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Martin, as somebody who's been covering these issues since before Ferguson, do you see the same kind of gradual improvement that Commander Hollis is describing? KASTE: There have definitely been policy changes. There's been sort of a change in attitude in departments on how use of force is used and documented. But you know, policing is a patchwork in this country. There's some talk now about changing the rules under which police can be sued. SHAPIRO: OK. KASTE: That's something that Congress is now maybe picking up the next few days. That might be something that unites left and right. SHAPIRO: NPR's Martin Kaste, thank you. KASTE: You're welcome.

(WEHT)- One week ago, Monday, George Floyd pleaded for his life on a street in Minneapolis pinned under the knee of a now former police officer. Since then protests have broken out all across the country. Including some locally. Evansville police are preparing for more potential protests. They tell us they’re hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Saturday the protest that started at the Four Freedoms Monument near the Evansville riverfront ended here and ended with three people in handcuffs. Now, fencing is up and these orange barriers are ready in case police need to block off Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard for another protest. Most agree Saturday’s demonstration in Evansville started peacefully. “I was really pleased that so many people came out. Please let so many people were motivated to come out to express themselves in a peaceful manner,” Mayor Winnecke says. However, three people were arrested when the protest moved to the Civic Center. Courtney Johnson says he understands why some frustrations are reaching the boiling point. “A tough time right now obviously and we’ve seen things happen over and over again and a lot of people are just tired of it and frustrated,” Johnson says. Johnson says he wants to commend protesters who stand up for what they believe, but he says there are a lot of poor comments. “I’ll speak on my experience in Evansville. It is rough to see all the comments and all the things on social media,” Johnson explains. “I hope that people watch what’s going on in other cities and say we don’t want that here. We don’t want the destruction and the mayham in the chaos that’s occurring in Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, pick a city,” Winnecke continues. Johnson says the protests are aimed at making sure what happened to Floyd does not happen again, “that’s why I feel like we’re supporting because it can happen and we don’t want it to happen.” “I’ve never walked in the shoes of a police officer. I know that our police officers are trained to do the right thing. I also know another human being and in a moment of stress anything could happen,” Mayor Winnecke says. “So I’m not so naïve to think it would never happen. I hope it does not. I hope it does not.” More demonstrations have taken place today with a group of people gathering near the Civic Center. Winnecke says if they need it EPD will have the support from the sheriff’s office and state police to keep protests from getting out of hand.

J.B. Pritzker Monday evening signed a disaster emergency declaration to provide assistance to municipalities as they respond to the escalation of protests in several counties. The counties include: Champaign, Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Macon, Madison, Sangamon, and Will. On May 31, Gov. Pritzker also sent 250 members of the Illinois National Guard to support various jurisdictions throughout the state in their work to protect communities.  He also ordered Illinois State Police to provide an additional 300 troopers to support local municipalities Monday night into Tuesday. This follows the Governor activating 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers for State Active Duty to fulfill a request for assistance from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The Guard is supporting local authorities in enforcing street closures around the city. The protest in Chicago is in response to the death of George Floyd, who died after being detained on Memorial Day in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Floyd’s death sparked outrage, national outcry, protests, and rioting in cities around the country. Related content: Comments comments",0.0

This week, they are in the midst of another. With staffs made lean by layoffs and furloughs, Marion County's restaurant operators have been problem-solving how to earn customers' trust again as they reopen in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. On May 22, they began to reopen outdoors only at 50% capacity. Monday was the first day they could invite customers back into dining rooms at half capacity. Monday also was the fourth day that people gathered Downtown to protest the deaths of black men and women at the hands of police, most recently George Floyd in Minneapolis and Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis. On Friday and Saturday nights, after organized peaceful protests ended, some people ravaged Downtown businesses and set fires in the streets. Many restaurants found themselves in the position of supporting the protesters' message against police brutality as they boarded up their windows and cleaned up what was left behind. Some have shifted their reopening plans because of the violent weekend. Others are determined to proceed as planned. Those outside of Downtown are not contending with damage, but the effects of the riots and resulting curfews are altering the way they open. The violence changed their plans On Friday night, the violence hit Michael's Soul Kitchen, spilling shattered glass on its red carpet inside. The elegant soul food restaurant and jazz club opened in 2019 at 115 E. Ohio St. While the restaurant has been shut down since mid-March, it was serving meals to vulnerable populations and started carryout about a week ago, co-owner Connie Oates-Allen said. She and co-owner Romeo Gerson had plans to open outdoor seating next week. They wanted to slowly adapt to the new normal. ""I'm still pretty afraid of the virus,"" Oates-Allen said. ""I know a lot of people are loosening up, and I just don't want to do anything that would endanger my staff or myself or any of our clients."" Instead, they're now awaiting estimates about the weekend's damage, and carryout is on hold. Supporters, including protesters, asked how they could help. So Oates-Allen and Gerson started a GoFundMe fundraiser, which had raised more than $8,200 of a $10,000 goal in just a few days. ""I totally understand the pain. I've been a black woman all of my life, and I know the pain and the frustration that everyone's feeling. I come from a family of policemen, so I know both sides,"" Oates-Allen said. ""I don't think it's good to destroy any business, not just a black business. Any business should not have to be destroyed because that's not the focus of what we're talking about."" Some restaurants are reopening on schedule The District Tap, another of Downtown's newer additions at Georgia and Meridian streets, reopened its indoor dining room as scheduled Monday. Michael Cranfill, who co-owns Cholita in Broad Ripple and the District Tap, said the business had been spared, even as nearby buildings were damaged. On Saturday, the restaurant posted signs in the window stating that ""TDT loves all."" ""We mean that, and maybe we got some respect from it,"" he said. The rioting had started before they were able to put up boards in the windows Saturday, he said, so they installed them Sunday. On Monday around lunch time, people were opting for patio seating that extended into Georgia Street because they enjoyed the weather and natural light, he said. Some are rebuilding and healing as they wait Napolese and Cafe Patachou locations Downtown saw damage to their facades and glass broken over the weekend, said Maddy Barnas, marketing director for Patachou Inc. restaurants. Neither had been operating since mid-March, and they boarded up both of the business fronts. The damage didn't alter their reopening plans, Barnas said. Napolese wasn't set to invite customers back inside until at least mid-June. Cafe Patachou has been undergoing renovations. Patachou Inc.'s locations outside Downtown are opening for carryout and outdoor seating but not indoors yet, Barnas said. Implementing new safety policies and retraining staff members returning from layoffs will take time. ""We're essentially reopening brand new businesses in a brand new landscape,"" Barnas said. In the meantime, boarded-up windows at Cafe Patachou and Napolese Downtown will soon look different. Patachou is selecting artists of color to paint them. After putting out a call on Facebook, Barnas said the response was overwhelming. ""We certainly sympathize with the protesters that were protesting peacefully, and we understand the sentiment behind the actions, whether people were protesting peacefully or violently. We get it,"" she said. ""In our initiative of doing the callout for the graffiti artist, we really wanted to create a safe space for people of color and people that were artists to come out and express themselves."" Ripple effect of the protests Many restaurants outside Downtown welcomed customers indoors across Marion County on Monday. While they did not suffer damage in the riots, the eateries still had to contend with new safety protocols and a curfew. Barbecue and Bourbon in Speedway started to build its business back up first through carryout — when a line went outside and past the roundabout, owner Marcia Huff said. Later, it opened for outdoor dining and saw wait times of an hour and a half, she said. Patrons have been loyal and bought big orders to help during a May without an Indianapolis 500, she said. Monday brought a stream of diners to the restaurant, Huff said, but it slowed when Mayor Joe Hogsett announced a curfew of 8 p.m. for a second night to quell riots after the protests. She said she understands why the mayor instituted the curfew but doesn't see how it aids Speedway businesses. ""It feels like we just can't catch a break in Marion County,"" Huff said. ""How shutting us (Speedway businesses) down is helping the situation at all, I just don't understand."" She decided to close at 5 p.m. to make sure her staff had enough time to clean the kitchen and drive home without feeling rushed. It also gives customers more time to be leisurely. ""Once people get in and get comfortable and start having a couple cocktails, trying to get them to leave without being rude is really hard,"" Huff said. ""They're just relaxing after work; they're just hitting that point where they're feeling good, and I'm going to have to walk up at 7:15 and say, 'Yeah, go.' "" The curfew came comes as restaurants were are continuing to adjust to new safety protocols. At Ale Emporium in Castleton, consistent sanitizing and disposable accoutrements, like coasters, are the norm. Staff members are wearing gloves and masks. ""Just to be able to successfully have that ... is also a feat as well,"" manager Eric Williams said. The Castleton restaurant closed at 6 p.m. Sunday and was set to do so at 7 p.m. Monday to stay within curfew, Williams said. Ale Emporium's locations are operating according to the rules of the county they're in. The Marion County curfew meant means shifting employees' schedules. Those who came in the morning closed are closing down because asking night employees to work for just a few hours didn't doesn't make sense, he said. Williams will continue tweaking the schedule depending on future announcements. ""Everybody here is very thankful — very thankful we're able to stay open because of the support that we've had,"" Williams said. ""There's not a person in here that doesn't understand the gravity of what's happening."" Looking for things to do?

They\'re all filled with National Guard troops. Credit: CNN By Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne, CNN (CNN) -- An active duty military police battalion consisting of some 200 to 250 military personnel is now in the process of deploying to Washington, DC, and could be in the nation's capital as soon as tonight, three US defense officials tell CNN. The troops are expected to provide security but not perform law enforcement duties such as the arrest and detention of protesters, according to the officials. Trump is making the move as cities across the country struggle to deal with protests, looting and rioting that began last week after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was being taken into police custody in Minneapolis. In the days since, as protests have spread throughout the country, officials and lawmakers have claimed extremist groups on the right and left are using the upheaval to foment violence and further unrest. Two defense officials said the troops will be coming from a unit at Ft. Bragg in North Carolina. Because of Washington's unique status, the deployment can be authorized by federal officials rather than the city's authorities. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump signaled the move in a call with governors earlier Monday in which he promised a demonstration of ""total domination"" in Washington, as he railed at the state leaders for looking ""weak"" and pushed them to call in the National Guard to ""dominate"" protesters and wished there was an ""occupying force"" in cities across America. ""Washington, they had large groups, very large groups. ... But Washington was under great control,"" Trump said. ""But we're going to have it under much more control. We're pouring in -- we're going to pull in thousands of people."" ""We're going to clamp down very, very strong,"" Trump said. ""The word is dominate. If you don't dominate your city and your state, they're gonna walk away with you. And we're doing it in Washington, in DC, we're going to do something that people haven't seen before. ...

As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. “We have the greatest country in the world,” Trump declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard.",0.0

(WANE) — Businesses are assessing the damage and picking up the pieces after three days of protest in downtown Fort Wayne. Over the weekend, protesters arrived on the Allen County Courthouse lawn to protest the death of George Floyd and police brutality. Friday and Saturday night went from peaceful to destructive, with police shooting tear gas at activists and nearly 100 people arrested. Sunday’s event was largely peaceful, however by Sunday night, the damage was already done. For some business owners across downtown, they spent their weekend boarding up walls, cleaning up glass from broken windows and doors, and removing graffiti. As a precaution, several businesses decided to close their doors to keep employees and patrons safe. “The escalation of it is what caught everyone’s attention,” Hoppy Gnome General Manager Peter Shuey said. “Once the tear gas started, it was, ‘What do we do now?’ Our first instinct was to keep everybody else safe.” Friday night, patrons of Hoppy Gnome on the corner of Clinton and Berry streets got a first-hand look at the escalation of the protest. Shuey said the patrons were out on the patio when the tear gas started. Shuey and other employees quickly helped get patrons inside, moved furniture inside, locked the doors, and closed down the restaurant. That night, the business choose to close for the weekend. “With the unpredictability of how it was going to unfold, we thought that risk was too much to take,” Shuey said. “We are a minority-owned business – we were with what was happening and we understand the message for sure, but for our guests and for our team, bringing more people into downtown didn’t seem like the prudent thing to do.” If more protests happen in the future, Shuey hopes they are peaceful like the one on Sunday. After Hoppy Gnome was forced to close due to the spread of COVID-19, employees say they are eager to get back to work. Shuey says that the restaurant has a plan if future protests escalate like they did Friday and Saturday. Hoppy Gnome was not damaged during the protest, but Shuey’s other restaurant, Proximo, did sustain damage. The business was closed due to COVID-19 and it was in the middle of a renovation when protesters broke two windows. Sheuy says the windows will be fixed before Proximo reopens in the next few weeks. Like many businesses, any more closures could put restaurants in jeopardy of laying off staff or closing for good. WANE 15 took a walk around downtown and spoke with owners of businesses that were damaged during the protest. Several owners say they feel torn – they understand and support demonstrators but they also support local law enforcement. What they don’t support is the protest turning destructive. Damage can be fixed but right now, owners say they are a loss for words and hope future protests are peaceful. As a precaution, many business owners choose to close for the weekend, and others chose to board up their windows. As of Monday some of the businesses have reopened.

Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday imposed an 11 p.m. curfew in an effort to prevent another night of violence in the city over the death of George Floyd. With an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, New York is joining other cities nationwide in imposing restrictions after days of unrest. The limit on the movement of 8.6 million people comes after months of restrictions already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo and de Blasio said the outbreaks of violence left them no choice, even as they advocated for peaceful demonstrators who have spoken out against police brutality and racial injustice. “We can’t let violence undermine the message of this moment,” de Blasio said. Cuomo blamed “people who are looking to distract and discredit” the protests and said they couldn’t be allowed to undermine public safety. The two leaders, both Democrats, also criticized some police actions as fueling protesters’ rage. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said earlier Monday on NBC’s “Today” that he worried about whether a curfew would be heeded. “If people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on,” he said. The announcement came after rioters overnight had smashed windows and plundered shops in parts of Manhattan, resulting in hundreds of arrests. A 21-year-old man was shot in the SoHo neighborhood around 12:30 a.m. and was taken to a hospital, police said. They said his injuries were not life-threatening. Groups of people poured down the sidewalks in Soho and other neighborhoods, including Union Square, breaking into Rolex, Kate Spade and Prada boutiques and electronics stores that have been shuttered for over two months because of the coronavirus. On Monday morning, police were visible on some of SoHo’s hardest-hit streets, and the smell of freshly cut plywood wafted as stores boarded up. “It’s disturbing because I’m 100 percent behind the protesters and against police brutality and bad cops killing people of color whenever they fricking want to, but this is a different story,” said Ruby Packard, a teacher and longtime SoHo resident. Sunday was the third night in a row of mainly peaceful daytime demonstrations, chaotic nights, hot spots of violence and arrests, with the mayor’s daughter among those arrested over the weekend. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO’S DAUGHTER CHIARA, ARRESTED AT MANHATTAN PROTEST Thousands of people have taken to the streets across the country to express outrage over Floyd’s death and other killings of black people by police and U.S. citizens. Floyd, who was black, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. On Sunday, New York City police made some gestures of solidarity with marchers during the day. Some officers knelt with protesters in an intersection as an organizer called out the names of people killed by police. But the police department has also come under criticism for confrontations with demonstrators over the weekend.

READ MORE: bit.ly/2U298ab Posted by WISH-TV on Monday, June 1, 2020 (CNN) — Declaring himself “your president of law and order,” President Donald Trump vowed Monday to return order to American streets using the military if widespread violence isn’t quelled, even as peaceful protesters just outside the White House gates were dispersed with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets. It was all, apparently, so Trump could visit a nearby church. The episode, which amounted to one of the most highly charged and discordant moments in recent presidential history, came as nationwide unrest escalates and as Trump comes under pressure to demonstrate a modicum of conciliation for a country torn along racial, ideological and political lines. He did not offer that on Monday, choosing instead to retrench. He called violent protests “domestic acts of terror” which law enforcement would “dominate the streets” to quell. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said. With the constant sound of helicopter blades overhead and a steady succession of bangs from nearby Lafayette Park, Trump declared himself an “ally of all peaceful protesters.” But as he was speaking, peaceful protesters were being urgently dispersed outside the White House gates by police using rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs. Several protesters were seen pouring water into their eyes to ease the gas’s sting. Later, Trump walked across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, a house of worship used by American presidents for more than a century that was partially burned in a Sunday evening protest. “We have the greatest country in the world,” Trump said in front of the church, holding a Bible and surrounded by aides, including national security adviser Robert O’Brien, Attorney General Bill Barr, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. He remained at the boarded-up building for a matter of minutes before returning inside the White House. Before Trump’s address, a crowd was gathering outside the White House gates ahead of a 7 p.m. ET curfew mandated by the mayor of Washington, including near the church. A large convoy of military vehicles was seen driving through the White House complex and onto Pennsylvania Avenue before Trump emerged to speak. Trump said from the Rose Garden he was committed to upholding laws and mobilizing military resources to end nationwide looting. “My first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people,” Trump said. “I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do.” In striking terms, Trump said he would use his entire presidential prerogative — including threatening to invoke a rarely used law dating back to 1807 — to ensure violent protests end, declaring he would deploy “thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers” to bring order. Trump said justice would be served for George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck as he was being arrested. He said he, along with many other Americans, was “rightly sickened and revolted” by video showing the incident. Ahead of his appearance on Monday evening, a debate had raged among Trump’s advisers over how and whether he should address protests that have spread to dozens of cities. And Trump himself was angered by coverage depicting him holed up in an underground bunker. He told aides on Monday he wanted to be seen outside the White House gates, according to a person familiar with the matter, which is part of what drove the decision to stage the photo-op at St. John’s Church. Trump and his family were rushed to an underground bunker on the White House complex as protests raged outside the building on Friday evening. Trump wasn’t seen on Sunday and spent most of Monday behind closed doors — leading to concern even from his allies that he was absent at a moment of national crisis. Many of the President’s traditional defenders — from campaign donors to Republicans on Capitol Hill to some in the conservative media — privately grumbled that Trump allowed several days to pass without addressing the nation or making any formal appeals for unity. Some outside allies reached out to the White House in recent days to push for an appearance from the President in which he would confront a crisis he has largely watched unfold from behind closed doors or in his underground bunker. One major campaign donor worried the damage inflicted by Trump’s absence during a historic weekend of violence and pain could alone imperil his reelection. A growing number of congressional Republicans, even Trump’s allies, also privately said the “caps lock” tweets about tamping down protests using harsh tactics were not helping the situation.

Tim Scott of South Carolina said on “Fox News Sunday” that he had spoken to Trump over the weekend about his inflammatory tweets, which he described as “not constructive.” Over the weekend, some aides sought to convince Trump not to use violent rhetoric after he wrote on Twitter that “when the looting starts the shooting starts,” warning language like that could inflame an already combustible situation and would not appear presidential. A senior White House aide said governors and mayors should be the ones responding to the destruction in their respective cities and states — a view at least partially shared by Trump, who has spent days going after local leaders for not calling the National Guard fast enough or cracking down on violence aggressively enough. In a heated phone call with governors on Monday morning, Trump placed responsibility on the governors for resolving the national crisis and said some of them appeared “weak” in their responses so far. Other White House officials argued over the weekend against something as formal as an Oval Office address, a person familiar said, out of concern that such a speech could “inflame the situation, not make it better.” As aides debate how and whether to confront the situation, Trump’s back-and-forth between violent rhetoric and a more measured tone has weighed in the deliberations, one official said. Some advisers wonder whether a presidential address calling for calm would be quickly erased by Trump’s own penchant for escalation and instigation.",0.0

In a piece published on Medium, Obama called on those who want to bring ""real change"" to both protest and cast ballots. Obama voiced support for the peaceful protests saying they represent ""a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States."" The former president also called out the ""small minority of folks who've resorted to violence in various forms"" writing they are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" Obama went on to say that violence should not be excused or rationalized. ""Let’s not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it. If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves,"" he wrote. Addressing those who say voting is a waste of time and protesting is the only way to bring about change for the recurrent problem of racial bias, Obama said he ""couldn't disagree more."" Instead, he said protests are meant to raise public awareness and that these ""aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices."" Obama added that local elected officials are the ones that matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system is local and state governments, not the federal government. ""Unfortunately, voter turnout in these local races is usually pitifully low, especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes,"" Obama wrote. Obama also called on local activists to research and educate citizens on their community and to determine ""what strategies work best."" On the part of local governments and law enforcement, the former president encouraged the establishment of independent review boards to investigate alleged misconduct. ""I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting — that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"" he wrote. ""But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful.""",0.0

Although many became violent in cities like Minneapolis, Chicago and even Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, the protests held in Michiana remained peaceful. The protests across the country this past weekend were held to not only speak out against the officer-involved killing of an unarmed black man named George Floyd in Minneapolis but also bring back the spotlight on police brutality and accountability. “It’s finally hitting home for people. We can’t take this anymore and it’s great that so many people showed up to the protest. So many people using their righteous rage to actually try to make some substantive change and that has been a long time coming,” Emmanuel Cannady, a Black Lives Matter activist said. While some Indiana cities like Fort Wayne and Indianapolis had protests turn into riots, here in Michiana, the demonstrations remained peaceful. “The folks that organized it wanted it peaceful so that’s what it was,” Cannady said. “Everyone has the right to protest, obviously, this tragic killing and our fop would like to thank our community for showing leadership through peaceful protest,” Harvey Mills the President of the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police. “We’re hoping that the south bend community will continue to be an example for the state and the country.” Even some local police officials in Michigan City taking in questions and talking with protestors. Now the topic of looting and rioting is highly debated across social media with some saying the riots are valid. “Personally, I think it’s justified anger at this point. When people have nothing else left, that’s what they’re going to resort to. It’s not an act of violence against their own neighborhood so to speak, it’s an act of violence against the system that has been violent to the people systemically,” Cannady said. While others say violence is never a means to an end. “Certainly we support protests however we do not support behavior that we’ve seen in other cities,” Michael Patton the President of the local NAACP chapter said. “Certainly George Floyd would be dishonored by doing that. We believe in peaceful marches protests and our city was a model for that.” Some say the reason why protests were peaceful over the weekend is because of how the police handled the situation. “One of our Black Lives Matter South Bend members was in Indianapolis. She said that the protests were actually incredibly peaceful when she first got there but it was actually when the police started tear-gassing that it became. The people fought back that’s when you saw the violence,” Cannady said. “Our police department was ready in case any lawlessness did occur. I think for the most part our officers tried to stay back and let those people protest that wanted to protest,” Mills said. The Black Live Matter Movement is having a national call to action week in response to the killing. So the local South Bend chapter is holding events this week to continue the conversation. Although BLM members locally say the protests will likely die down in the coming weeks. there is a scheduled youth-run protest that is going to be held here at the Morris Performing Arts Center on Friday. Other events include a Chalk the Sidewalk for Black Lives event outside of the county city building on Wednesday. It is being held to “discuss officer-involved murders of black men and women.” It's not only to address South Bend’s own officer-involved shooting of Eric Logan last June but for other names out there like George Floyd. There will also be several zoom seminars this week held by BLM. “The conversation for a lot of folks has never stopped. And I think for a lot of new folks that are just coming into the conversation. And we need to continue this but we need to do more than just talk. We need to act. We need to vote. We need to show up at council meetings,” Cannady said.",0.0

The mayor is ordering another curfew. And city councilors are pondering which policies may best effect change. As the city of Indianapolis braces for another potentially dangerous nightfall, it has been forced to reflect over the events of the past weekend in which hundreds of protesters joined a nationwide movement against the killing of black civilians at the hands of police. Indianapolis police are reviewing several videos of the protests from the past weekend to ensure proper Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department procedures were followed, Chief Randal Taylor announced on Monday. That includes an investigation into one video that shows use of force against several arrested individuals, he said. ""As I've repeatedly said, we swear an oath to protect the safety of the people in this community,"" Taylor said. ""And we take that very seriously."" The actions come after a rocky three consecutive nights of protests that began peacefully during the day but gradually erupted into a violent turmoil of tear gas, pepper ball bullets and vandalism that left downtown shattered. Police review The tense interactions between civilians and police throughout the weekend are just the type of situations that the department's new use of force review board would investigate, Taylor said Monday. The board was formed after years of frustration over the police shooting of Aaron Bailey and the more recent shooting death of Dreasjon Reed — the latter of which was captured on Facebook live last month. The group will review all uses of force, both fatal and nonfatal, replacing an existing internal firearms review panel that reviews shootings. Hogsett has requested a reformed use-of-force policy from the department within the next two weeks while still asking residents to remain peaceful as they protest. ""I would urge that even as we continue to work to ensure that peaceful demonstrations are permitted to the greatest extent possible, these voices of change continue to work with us to ensure that those who might do harm to our city and their movement are not allowed to destroy the march of progress,"" he said. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Ryan Mears has announced that he will not file criminal charges against 41 protesters who were arrested on Friday and Saturday. Fourteen other people, however, were charged with burglary. 'Unfortunately, I'm tired' Meanwhile, the City-County Council is forced to reckon with the civil unrest that made its way to the steps of the City-County Building this weekend. Some city councilors participated in part of the peaceful protest on Saturday — and while they don't support the looting and the vandalism of local businesses, some say they can understand the frustration. Councilor Maggie Lewis said she understands the anger, even though she does not support the approach of hurting other people or destroying property. But property can be replaced, she noted, while lives cannot. ""I am tired of having these conversations with my kiddos about being black in this community and being black in this country,"" said Lewis, who has a 13-year-old black son. ""But that's where we're at. And so I need to be honest with my child about the times that we're living in. As an elected official, I've heard from a lot of my constituents about being tired."" The council had already begun to tackle racial inequity even before the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected African Americans, and the hectic 24 hours in May in which two black men were killed by police. One council proposal introduced in February seeks to collect data to analyze how racial inequity impacts public city services. Still, the council's public safety committee could review IMPD reforms, Lewis noted, while the administration and finance committee can see how it's spending dollars in minority communities. Taking to the streets on Saturday brought Councilor Crista Carlino hope. She said she wrote down everything she heard — all of the necessary policy revisions for the city moving forward. ""I'm working to do everything that I can to make sure that those requests are being heard and taken very, very seriously,"" she said. ""And that we're putting not pencil to paper but pen to paper to get these things done."" Like some councilors, though, Carlino had concerns about the actions of police officers. ""I think it didn't go perfectly,"" she said of how local police handled the weekend. ""I think there were some actions by individual officers and groups of officers that were very disheartening to see. And I know in the coming hours and days we will probably talk more about that."" Council President Vop Osili said councilors came out to ensure that protesters knew they heard them. There was something about Saturday, he said, that began the process of normalizing the discussion that racism exists. ""These last two months have shown us that when we come out of it, it's going to have to be a new normal,"" Osili said. ""And that new normal has to be established as something that is about equity and the destruction of those things that have created these generations of disparity.""

On any given day, a National Guard spokesman said, 2,000 to 4,000 Guardsmen are on duty for a variety of missions. A president mobilizing the Guard to respond to a situation, however, is rare. In January 2017, President Trump threatened in a tweet to ""send in the Feds!"" in response to violence in Chicago. Ultimately, he didn't. National Guard historians, in response to a request by the Chicago Tribune, listed 12 times since the enactment of the 1952 Armed Forces Reserve Act when the Guard was called into duty and operated under the control of the president. Many of these incidents were during the turbulent civil rights struggles in the 1960s. This list doesn't include the many times the Guard was activated by a governor and operated under state control, and, in about half of the examples below, the governor of the state asked for help. 1957-58 Desegregation of Little Rock school On Sept. 23, 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order sending troops from the Army's 101st Airborne Division to maintain order and peace during the integration of Central High School by nine black students in Little Rock, Ark.

Despite the presence of more than 120 federal marshals who were on hand to protect Meredith from harm, the crowd turned violent. The next morning, two civilians were dead and scores more were reported injured. After spending the night of Sept. 30 under federal protection, Meredith was allowed to register for classes the following morning, and became the first black graduate from the university in August 1963.

George Wallace, who had made a campaign promise to prevent the integration even if he had to stand in the schoolhouse door, temporarily blocked the students' entrance by doing just that June 11, 1963.

1622725787,2020-06-01 17:25:00,"From Jobs To Homeownership, Protests Put Spotlight On Economic Divide",https://www.wbaa.org/post/jobs-homeownership-protests-put-spotlight-economic-divide,en,False,,74795,wbaa.org,http://wbaa.org/#spider,"The death of a black man at the hands of white police officers has sparked days of civil unrest in the United States. Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits.""  Copyright 2020 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers, that we dominate the streets. CHANG: And as President Trump made his remarks to the nation, protesters chanted outside the White House. Immediately after, the president exited the White House and walked a brief distance to St. John's Church. The historic church was damaged by a fire during the recent protests. NPR's Tim Mak joins us now from Washington with more. Hi, Tim. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: So what are you seeing right now at the moment? MAK: So I'm at the corner of Connecticut and I Street NW, not very far from the White House. And we just saw a few dozen protesters kind of get enveloped by lines of police on either side of us. It looks like they are making arrests right now. They did let the press kind of squeeze out through an exit, but they checked all badges. And basically, anyone who didn't have a press badge at that time, it looks like, is being detained. We've now been pushed about a block away from that now. CHANG: Wow, OK. Can you describe the moment that we just mentioned, when the president left the White House on foot to visit the damaged church. Tell us what happened exactly there. MAK: Well, authorities very quickly cleared protesters from Lafayette Park in order for the president to make that short walk from the White House over there. And once there, he stood holding a Bible. The president invited other officials, including the attorney general and the White House press secretary, to join him. It's not a very large distance between those two venues. That's St. John's Church. I should mention this is a church of significant historical importance and has been visited by every president since James Madison. Now, of course, Lafayette Park is the area right in front of the White House, where a lot of demonstrators have gathered in recent days. CHANG: OK. And I know that you have been out there for a while. You have been talking to protesters. What kind of things are you hearing in reaction to the president's remarks tonight? MAK: Well, I'm not sure a lot of the people who have been out here were listening to the president's remarks in real time. CHANG: Interesting. MAK: There's a - definitely a disconnect between the people who are here demonstrating today and what the president is trying to convey from the White House, from the Rose Garden and so forth. We spoke to Joseph Varrentas (ph). He's a 28-year-old who lives here in Washington, D.C. He came down, and he said that he was protesting against violence, against some of the actions of law enforcement in recent days. We saw bruises and cuts on his arms and on his forearm. And we also observed over the course of the last hour and a half or so, you know, police pushing back against protesters. We saw some minor injuries. We saw law enforcement using riot shields and using their batons in kind of rhythmic fashion to push demonstrators back away from the White House. CHANG: Well, there is now a local curfew in effect in Washington, D.C., as of 7 p.m. Eastern. It is now 8 p.m. where you are. Does it look like that curfew is going to be enforced? Does it look like that people are going to respect it? What's your sense at this moment? MAK: When we first were walking around at around 7 o'clock, when the curfew began to take effect, we did see people leaving. But it appears now that the people who are here are the people who are willing and interested in staying and not adhering to that curfew. We are not seeing - we don't know if the curfew is being enforced or whether other issues are being enforced. As I mentioned, a few dozen protesters were just enveloped and detained right in front of us here. CHANG: All right. That is NPR's Tim Mak, who's joined us from near the White House. Tim, please stay safe. Thank you very much. MAK: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

Racism is a pervasive social evil that we must be committed to fighting and eradicating wherever we find it, in ourselves and in society. It is antithetical to our Christian faith which proclaims the dignity of every human person created in the image and likeness of God. In many cities across our nation, including in Fort Wayne and South Bend, people have gathered to rightly protest the killing of George Floyd and the injustices suffered by African-Americans in our country. Sadly, violence has broken out at protests in many places. Rioting and looting only cause further injustice. Violence solves nothing and causes further harm. Substantive changes are needed in our society to eradicate racism and racial injustice, beginning with a commitment to respect for the life and God-given dignity of every human person. Let us pray that God will heal our society and help our nation to put an end to the destructive evil of racism and an end to violence in our communities. I am asking our priests to offer the special ‘Mass for the Preservation of Peace and Justice’ on a day this week.

Some of Trump's allies seem unhappy with his response to the ongoing racial unrest in the country. By Kevin Liptak and Sarah Westwood, CNN (CNN) -- Declaring himself ""your president of law and order,"" President Donald Trump vowed Monday to return order to American streets using the military if the violence isn't quelled, even as peaceful protesters just outside the White House gates were dispersed with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets. It was all, apparently, so Trump could visit a nearby church. The episode, which amounted to one of the most highly charged and discordant moments in recent presidential history, came as nationwide unrest escalates and as Trump comes under pressure to demonstrate a modicum of conciliation for a country torn along racial, ideological and political lines. He did not offer that on Monday, choosing instead to retrench. He called violent protests ""domestic acts of terror"" which law enforcement would ""dominate the streets"" to quell. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" Trump said. With the constant sound of helicopter blades overhead and a steady succession of bangs from nearby Lafayette Park, Trump declared himself an ""ally of all peaceful protesters."" But as he was speaking, peaceful protesters were being urgently dispersed outside the White House gates by police using rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs. Several protesters were seen pouring water into their eyes to ease the gas's sting. Later, Trump walked across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, a house of worship used by American presidents for more than a century that was partially burned in a Sunday evening protest. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump said in front of the church, holding a Bible and surrounded by aides, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Attorney General Bill Barr, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. He remained at the boarded-up building for a matter of minutes before returning inside the White House. Before Trump's address, a crowd was gathering outside the White House gates ahead of a 7 p.m. ET curfew mandated by the mayor of Washington, including near the church. A large convoy of military vehicles was seen driving through the White House complex and onto Pennsylvania Avenue before Trump emerged to speak. Trump said from the Rose Garden he was committed to upholding laws and mobilizing military resources to end nationwide looting. ""My first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people,"" Trump said. ""I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do."" In striking terms, Trump said he would use his entire presidential prerogative -- including threatening to invoke a rarely used law dating back to 1807 -- to ensure violent protests end, declaring he would deploy ""thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers"" to bring order. Trump said justice would be served for George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck as he was being arrested. He said he, along with many other Americans, was ""rightly sickened and revolted"" by video showing the incident. Ahead of his appearance on Monday evening, a debate had raged among Trump's advisers over how and whether he should address protests that have spread to dozens of cities. Some of the President's allies were growing increasingly frustrated with what had felt like silence from the White House. And many of the President's traditional defenders -- from campaign donors to Republicans on Capitol Hill to some in the conservative media -- privately grumbled that Trump allowed several days to pass without addressing the nation or making any formal appeals for unity. Some outside allies reached out to the White House in recent days to push for an appearance from the President in which he would confront a crisis he has largely watched unfold from behind closed doors or in his underground bunker. One major campaign donor worried the damage inflicted by Trump's absence during a historic weekend of violence and pain could alone imperil his reelection. A growing number of congressional Republicans, even Trump's allies, also privately said the ""caps lock"" tweets about tamping down protests using harsh tactics were not helping the situation. Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he had spoken to Trump over the weekend about his inflammatory tweets, which he described as ""not constructive."" Over the weekend, some aides sought to convince Trump not to use violent rhetoric after he wrote on Twitter that ""when the looting starts the shooting starts,"" warning language like that could inflame an already combustible situation and would not appear presidential. A senior White House aide said governors and mayors should be the ones responding to the destruction in their respective cities and states -- a view at least partially shared by Trump, who has spent days going after local leaders for not calling the National Guard fast enough or cracking down on violence aggressively enough. In a heated phone call with governors on Monday morning, Trump placed responsibility on the governors for resolving the national crisis and said some of them appeared ""weak"" in their responses so far. Other White House officials argued over the weekend against something as formal as an Oval Office address, a person familiar said, out of concern that such a speech could ""inflame the situation, not make it better."" As aides debate how and whether to confront the situation, Trump's back-and-forth between violent rhetoric and a more measured tone has weighed in the deliberations, one official said. Some advisers wonder whether a presidential address calling for calm would be quickly erased by Trump's own penchant for escalation and instigation.

According to multiple U.S. intelligence sources, law-enforcement officials in various departments nationwide and analysts monitoring the activity, the playbook in every city is almost the same: the peaceful protests are organized, and a point place is designated for people to gather in the daylight hours. But, as the night falls and thousands go home, the looting and discord are ignited by a fresh round of people camouflaged with dark clothing and masks, armed with spray paint for graffiti and sometimes homemade weapons, and their nefarious behavior continues well into the early hours. “The most important thing to realize is the difference between is between the protestors and the rioters. The protestors are mostly peaceful, and the rioters who come next are Antifa going into areas with Black Lives Matter [BLM] signs,” said Lorenzo Boyd, an assistant professor for diversity and inclusion and director for the Center for Advanced Policing at the University of New Haven. “It is a mob mentality, really.” Many officials concurred that while they may be a small amount of crossover between the protesters and rioters, it is generally limited. And, while the umbrella of BLM is being used, elements seemingly aligned with Antifa have been commandeering the organization’s name. GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY, COUNTY OFFICIALS RELEASE AUTOPSY RESULTS DECLARING HOMICIDE Images and footage online showed the looting and destruction were being committed by a mix of races and ethnicities, but a giant spotlight has been shone on Antifa as agitators. And, baffling officials: the level of intelligence-sharing and organization involved from what appears to be the Antifa wing. “We had no idea it was this sophisticated,” one high-ranking source within the Minneapolis Police Department, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said. Those causing the trouble seemingly would coordinate through social media and encrypted apps on the backs of the peaceful protesters late at night, the insider continued. “The rioters use different weapons like Molotov cocktails and slingshots, and even tennis rackets so they can launch rocks from a block away, and you can’t see it coming,” the source said. JOURNALIST ATTACKED BY ANTIFA SPEAKS OUT ON GROUP’S ALLEGED EXTREMISM, RADICAL IDEOLOGY There have been other tactics, as well. “We will get a lot of police calls about the KKK being somewhere, but when we go to the place, no one is there,” the source said. “But, even if it amounts to nothing, all those calls have to be documented.” President Trump this week has vowed to designate Antifa a domestic terrorist organization, and Attorney General William Barr has said that “groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda,” and that “the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.” Although Antifa is traditionally understood to be a leaderless movement, analysts and law enforcement on both state and federal levels have been working to piece together coordinating figures pulling strings. “President Trump wants to designate Antifa a terrorist group, but Antifa has no structure or centralized leadership, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t leaders now emerging,” observed Tony Schiena, the CEO of security firm MOSAIC. “I don’t believe it’s a coordinated riot but do believe that groups are utilizing it to push their agendas and misguided individuals are buying into it and being opportunistic and looting which basically becomes cop-cat rioting.” In one case, Pittsburgh police on Sunday issued an arrest warrant for a man they believed played a key role in inciting violence in the city on Saturday night. The suspect: 20-year-old Amazon employee Brian Jordan Bartels, who was facing charges of “institutional vandalism, rioting and reckless endangerment of another person.” Bartel allegedly was identified in a video donning all-black and “breaking the windows out of a marked Pittsburgh Police vehicle Uptown, against the wishes of peaceful protesters who tried to stop him,” police said. A list of others arrested in Pittsburgh on Sunday night showed at least two apparently were minors, and the others ranged in age from 19 to 54, but most were in their twenties. Around one-third of those arrested were women. Meanwhile, in New York, it is believed that the groups have operated using encrypted communications and seek external funding for bail money. One source connected to the NYPD pointed out that political and celebrity vows to bail out those arrested across the country have inflamed the situation and further emboldened the violence. Moreover, rumors were being stirred up across social media to conjure up fear and anxiety in communities even in far-reaching counties such as Suffolk County in Long Island, a common terrorist tactic, the police source said, adding that federal and local police, in recent days, have infiltrated the various rioting clusters to ascertain further information below the radar. “But, those doing the damage are from all walks of life, kids to educated adults. Some come in groups, and some come alone,” the official continued. One known Antifa offshoot in New York, as investigated by Fox News, came together for planning meetings regarding various social causes in early 2019 and was comprised mainly of university students, local writers and artists, some former U.S. military members and minority groups passionate about multiple causes ranging from LGBTQ rights and Palestinian rights to Native American and immigration issues. Ready-made “F– the Police” signs stood at the ready whenever needed, and a few of the most vocal in the group typically advised newcomers on how to deal with such things as tear gas or police pushback. The effort was led primarily by a university professor and self-proclaimed human rights activist with extensive experience in protest movements. Little vetting was done on those who joined the group, but when it came to discussing anything potentially criminal, all discussion went underground. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has stressed that “there clearly was coordination” among the looting faction and that “they were clearly listening to our radio traffic.” “The number of U-Haul trucks that magically showed up in front of stores, car caravans that dropped people off and broke windows, and they were hustling the goods out into the backs of the cars,” she added. “Absolutely, it was organized – there’s no question whatsoever about that.” Furthermore, Richmond, Va., Police Chief Will Smith emphasized during a Sunday morning news conference that “we have people from across the country who have traveled many states to be here” and that they “know that this is an organized effort.” Several officials, including Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell, have pointed to white-supremacy groups as also having penetrated the riots. He said Sunday that law enforcement was cognizant of their presence on the ground, but it remained unclear how many there were and if they belonged to a specific outfit. Ian Bradbury, the president of Terra Nova Strategic Management, a Canadian advisory and strategy firm that has enabled the counter-violent-extremism sector to better resolve complex challenges, said that the most observable of those committing violence and riot behavior included local street gangs, local and out-of-state anarchists and Antifa groupings – using black bloc tactics centered on vandalism of public property and rioting – as well as unassociated individuals. “Some far-right elements have been observed acting as provocateurs, but with only minor observable representation thus far in comparison to other actors. Should the destabilizing conditions continue, these observations may shift as more interests become involved,” he asserted. As for just how “outside” the rioters were, those on the ground contend it’s been a mixed bag of locals as well as opportunists from rural areas and neighboring states. Several sources interviewed by Fox News indicated that there was little to prove an overwhelming outside presence, as most arrests in cities seemingly were those living in and around the area. But in the case of Detroit, as per Mayor Mike Duggan, many have traveled from out-of-state to contribute to the calamity. On Friday, he claimed 65 percent of those arrested were from outside the Detroit area and even well beyond Michigan’s borders. That number jumped to 75 percent on Saturday night. And, as Boyd pointed out, many of those arrested this weekend in Boston stemmed from outside the urban hub and were from New Hampshire, Vermont and rural pockets of Massachusetts. Officials also were rushing to develop a clearer picture of the involvement of foreign actors and cyber instigators in the calamity, both in pushing narratives and as propaganda victories. “Chinese propaganda has been quick to label the American government as incompetent as the U.S. deals with an intricate network of interstate activists using technology to exploit revolutionary lessons learned since Ferguson, and perfected in places like Portland, Oregon, against unprepared communities across America,” global-risk analyst Dennis Santiago conjectured. “The Chinese clearly remain worried that their mishandling of the novel coronavirus outbreak will have severe repercussions from the global community as post-COVID-19 re-opening and realignment of supply chain dependencies plays out.” He also highlighted the role cyber has played in adding fuel to the fire. “Social-media engines have had to contend with a new series of both artificial intelligence and expert-system robotic attacks from abroad in recent times, particularly pushing the Chinese narrative that the U.S. is an incompetent government,” he said. “Born out of worry about the novel coronavirus, the extent to which it has was a contributor to domestic U.S. events remains to be seen. There are other… robotic-narrative campaigns sourced within the U.S. that are equally powerful. This is still an election year, and the presidential election is divisive.” Experts largely have concurred that the extended lockdown to squash the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, created something of a “perfect storm” that thousands of looters have been able to exploit – either driven by pent-up frustration or loss of income. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But, with mass riots and little in the way of “social distancing,” some analysts feared the worst was still to come. “The riots have underplayed the COVID-19 threat,” Schiena added. “We are potentially facing disastrous consequences with a potential severe spike in cases, forcing an extend lockdown and damage the U.S. economy even further.”",0.0

Shortly after, Trump came to the White House Rose Garden to call himself the “law and order” president, saying “domestic terrorism” was to blame for the unrest. “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property,” he said. “We will end it now.” He called on governors to use their National Guard military police units to “dominate the streets” and threatened to deploy the active duty military if governors failed to use the National Guard more forcefully. He said he may invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which permits a president to deploy military inside the U.S. to deal with civil disorder. Before Trump spoke, tear gas and flash bangs were used to clear what appeared to be peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and near St. John’s Church, which protesters set fire to briefly Sunday night. Trump and aides then walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to pose before cameras at the church, holding a Bible. “We have the greatest country in the world, we’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said, expressing resolve that the country is coming back but did not otherwise engage on reporter questions. Attorney General Bill Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joined the president for a group photo. He then began the walk back to the White House after just a minute or so in front of the church, his daughter Ivanka trailing him. “What the president did was call out the American military against American citizens,” New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday just after Trump spoke, “just so he could have a photo op of him walking to the church.” “It was just for photo opportunity. I mean it is it is amazing calling out the American military for a photo opportunity. That’s what it was. I mean it was shameful,” Cuomo told CNN. “It was really, truly shameful.” Several truckloads of DC National Guard military police had arrived near Lafayette Park where large groups of protesters had fought with police for the past three nights, at one point on Friday causing officials to have Trump taken to a bunker below the White House for his protection. A U.S. official said that active duty Army military police units from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were preparing to be on standby in the Washington, D.C. area Monday night after three days of violent protests. The National Guard troops are going to be protecting national monuments, the White House, property, and infrastructure, the official said. Not all DC Guard troops will be armed, the official said. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Barr were seen walking near the police line in Lafayette Park as military vehicles were stationed nearby. Mayor Muriel Bowser Monday afternoon declared a curfew beginning at 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. Tuesday. The curfew time roughly coincided with the dispersal of the protesters and Trump’s walkover to the photo op at the church. “During the hours of the curfew, no person, other than persons designated by the Mayor, shall walk, bike, run, loiter, stand, or motor by car or other mode of transport upon any street, alley, park, or other public place within the District,” the mayor’s order said. Earlier, as the White House geared up for another night of protests outside its gates, President Trump lashed out at governors for their handling of demonstrations over George Floyd’s death, emphasizing instances of rioting and looting that marred overwhelmingly peaceful protests across the country. As his press secretary cited Martin Luther King Jr.’s support for nonviolence, Trump shared a message from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who suggested unleashing a U.S. Army air assault division on those carrying out “anarchy, rioting, and looting.” “100% Correct,” the president wrote. Rather than focus on protesters’ grievances — such as systemic racism and police brutality — Trump has increasingly turned his focus to squelching the civil unrest that has accompanied the national demonstrations and has taken a hardline stance to restoring order. He has said, without offering evidence, that much of the rioting that has wracked American cities over recent nights has been carried out by supporters of the amorphous “antifa” movement — a loose group of people who define themselves as anti-fascist. He tweeted Sunday that the U.S. would designate the group a terrorist organization, but the White House did not say Monday under what legal authority it would do so, nor did it explain how it could prosecute its members as terrorists. The president told the nation’s governors on a call Monday that they need to “dominate” over the ongoing situation of unrest and has related the situation to a military conflict. “You have to dominate, if you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump said, according to a recording of the call obtained by ABC News. “They’re gonna run over you, you’re gonna look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.” He said at another point: “It is a war in a certain sense and we’re gonna end it fast.” In a surprising statement, the president told the governors he is putting Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley, his top military adviser, “in charge” of the response to the domestic protests. The president did not explain what he meant by putting Milley “in charge.” Press secretary McEnany did little to clarify the president’s meaning except to tell ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl that the federal government would be deploying “additional federal assets” and that Milley would play a role in a “central command center” to coordinate the responses on the local level. McEnany also sought to downplay the meaning of the president’s call for governors to “dominate” the streets, saying the president’s interest in calling for greater National Guard activation is not to squelch protests but to allow for them to proceed peacefully. “When those lines are overwhelmed, law enforcement gets on the defense so what the president has said is he wants to dominate the streets with National Guard, with the police presence and what studies have shown… that when there is an overwhelming National Guard presence it actually deescalates the situation and causes less civil unrest. So Gen Milley has really been on point in talking about the National Guard. The effectiveness and ensuring that they are utilized to great effect across the country,” she said. Some advisers have pushed the president to deliver an address to the nation about the worst civil unrest Americans have seen in decades. Trump has so far resisted, with no plan for remarks from the Oval Office, the setting for many momentous speeches during times of crises in previous presidencies. McEnany on Monday pointed to Trump’s scripted remarks about Floyd and the protests that he delivered during a trip to Florida for a space shuttle launch. She disputed the notion the president has stayed silent. “What I would note is that continual statements, as he has made day and day and day and day again, they don’t stop anarchy,” she told reporters at the White House. “What stops anarchy is action, and that’s what the president is working on right now.” For three days, peaceful protests like those nationwide have ended yards from the White House, and each night the gatherings have devolved into clashes with police. On Friday, the White House went on lockdown, and the U.S. Secret Service whisked Trump to an underground bunker to shelter in place, according to senior sources familiar with the matter. The White House has maintained an “elevated security posture,” with staffers on Monday discouraged from coming in and advised to hide their badges, according to an email sent to staff Sunday night. In a series of tweets since late last week, Trump has fanned the flames of division by threatening to sic “vicious dogs” on protesters outside the White House — evoking ugly images of dogs used on African Americans in the 1960a — and writing, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The latter, made famous by a Miami police chief in the 1960s, was roundly condemned for its racist history. Few Republicans have spoken out aside from the Senate’s lone black Republican, Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who called Trump’s tweets “not constructive.” “I do think some of his tweets have not been helpful,” Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., said Monday. “It would be helpful if he changed the tone of his message.” Over the weekend, the entire DC National Guard was called up to assist with maintaining order, and a mix of law enforcement agencies — among them Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, the Secret Service, and U.S. Park Police — pushed back protesters near the White House. Other federal units have joined, as well, including riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons and a Federal Bureau of Investigation hostage rescue team, a senior Department of Justice official said Monday. Trump on Monday said in his call with the governors said Washington would be “under much more control” because “we’re pouring in and we’re going to pull in thousands of people.” “We’re going to clamp down very strongly,” he said, later adding, “We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” He did not elaborate.

Cleaning up their city. Isaiah Rodgers didn’t have such grand ambitions in mind when he and his friends took to the streets Sunday afternoon, less than 24 hours after riots — borne of the nation-wide protests against police brutality — ravaged parts of Tampa. The Indianapolis Colts rookie cornerback and 22-year-old black man doesn’t know what will mend race relations in America. He doesn’t know how to solve the scourge of police brutality. What he does know is that Tampa is his home, and he doesn’t want to see it destroyed. “We just wanted to help the community, and we had to start somewhere,” Rodgers told IndyStar on Monday. Sunday’s good deed gone viral started when a friend proposed the idea of going out into Tampa to start clearing up the damage cause by back-to-back nights of riots. More Colts coverage: The group started small, Rodgers said. It was just him, fellow NFL players and Tampa natives Auden Tate (Bengals) and Ray-Ray McCloud (Bills), as well a few of their friends from the area. Initially they’d planned to help clean up around a mall they frequented as kids. But when they saw much of the work already done, they walked across the street to a Champs Sports store that had been ravaged by a fire. The initial group of six or seven got to work, expecting the clean-up to take half a day. But then more people started to arrive. When word started spreading around town what was happening, Rodgers said, people started pitching in. Eventually, about 30 people helped clean up around the Champs. The work was finished in just two hours. “People were pulling up, bringing us gloves and wipes and masks and water,” Rodgers said. “Some police officers even came by and started clapping for us. It was a good vibe.” Even better was that they seemed to have inspired their community. In the hours following the clean-up, Rodgers' phone blew up with people asking when he next planned to volunteer — and whether they could tag along. He’s going back out, he assures them, and there’s plenty of work to be done. Rodgers admitted that at first, he didn’t take the protests very seriously. But then he started seeing buildings burning and the livelihoods of many being destroyed. “We’re all from the area, so we kind of took it personal,” Rodgers said. “You realize people are going to have to wake up in the morning and realize they don’t have a job anymore. They were already dealing with coronavirus — so a lot of them weren’t working, but now they really don’t have a job. It’s just making lives worse.” Rodgers understands why some feel the need to protest. The anger and anguish brought about by police brutality are feelings he probably understands better than most. “My father,” Rodgers said, “passed from police brutality, so some things hit me a little harder.” When Rodgers was 16, a police officer shot and killed his father, Craig Rodgers, after responding to a kidnapping complaint made on behalf of Craig Rodgers’ girlfriend. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Craig Rodgers was shot by officer John Morningstar after Morningstar said Craig Rodgers threatened him with a pipe and charged at him. Morningstar was not charged in the shooting. Rodgers doesn’t see the merit of hate. “Look, I’m not running around saying, ‘Death to the police,” Rodgers explained. “(To make an impact), you have to continue doing the positive things, so at least you try to make them like us in some way. If that’s what you gotta do it; that’s the way you gotta do it.” If there’s one message Rodgers could get to all of those enraged by the injustice of racism and police brutality, it’s do everything you can to prevent letting that anger evolve into destruction. “When you get to burning down places … that’s not protesting anymore. Not in my eyes,” Rodgers said. “And we all felt that way about it. We wanted to show the community and we kept saying this (Sunday), ‘Let’s clean, not destroy. That was our motto yesterday. My main thing is to make people around me better. That’s what I care about. “I don’t think people realize it, but there are a lot of people who want to come together and help. That’s what we wanted to show. That’s what we why we did what we did.” Follow IndyStar Colts Insider Jim Ayello on Twitter: @jimayello.",0.0

Kira Robinson was one of those protesters. She said things were peaceful until police were called and that once they arrived, that protesters became more agitated. However, no arrests were made and no damage was done to the city. Robinson hopes other larger cities take notice, and that police listen to their message as well. “It’s important to me just because you can hear us without out us not having to use our hands without you not having to use force,” Robinson said. “We are trying to move forward and be better than that, we’re trying to let you hear us but it’s literally going in ear and out the other, like you’re hearing us but you’re not listening.” Goshen Mayor Jeremy Stutsman agrees and said that he’s proud of his city, and encourages protests to remain peaceful. “I do encourage everybody to make sure and keep them peaceful and do all you can to get your voice out there, that’s very important and that’s our right. But we do need to remain respectful of others while we try to figure out how to get ahead of this, this issue we’re having in our country,” Stutsman said. So far, there’s no word on any upcoming protests in the Goshen area but Robinson said that there is a plan to have another protest in Mishawaka on June 19.",0.0

While he headed toward the crowd, police also were nearby. Police had ordered them to stop. A few did and others ran. Using his cellphone, Essex was rolling when the protesters started running. On Monday afternoon, IMPD Chief Randal Taylor addressed the video. “One of these videos shows force being used during an arrest of several individuals. I have directed our internal affairs unit to immediately conduct a speedy and through investigation into this incident,” Taylor said. In the video, it is clear police had ordered two women to the ground; they didn’t comply. You can hear one officer say ‘Light her up.” That’s when another officer instantly shot her with rubber bullets. The woman still refused the officers commands, and she was hit repeatedly on the legs with a baton. “While I don’t have enough information yet for disciplinary actions, I can tell you that this type of incident is exactly the type of incident that the new use of force review board we are creating is aimed at reviewing,” said Taylor. The city has endured unprecedented violence, looting and civil unrest. The countywide curfew had been in effect for 30 minutes when the incident shown in this video happened. Protesters and others in the immediate downtown area had been warned several times to either go home or face arrest. Mayor Joe Hogsett was in the WISH-TV studio Monday morning. One of our questions was whether there had been complaints about police acting too aggressively toward the protesters. “Whatever needs to be investigated has been … those investigations will begin and continue, and if there are any officers who have acted inappropriately, the chief will be given a recommendation of discipline,” Hogsett said.

Andy Becker told the Rapid City Journal Monday morning. GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: CITIES FACE NEW LOOTING AMID STRONGER NATIONAL GUARD RESPONSE, CURFEWS The police believe armed civilian patrols could encourage protesters who had no plans to show up, Becker said. Instead, he discouraged armed citizens from helping, especially if any violent protests occur. “We need to be able to do our job, to contain the problem and issue, and having folks threatening to take matters into their own hand actually only makes it harder for us to do the job.” — Lt. Andy Becker, Rapid City Police Department community relations specialist Becker spoke to the newspaper as a crowd of protesters – some carrying weapons – began to gather around 11 a.m. local time at a local mall. The group, now 5,500 members since being established Sunday, expressed concern about the protesters – such as whether the protesters’ group included people from out of state and had arrived in caravans of cars and buses, the report said. However, rumors of busloads of out-of-town protesters were false.

In addition, some downtown business owners prepared for riots after being advised to do so by the police department. During the meeting of the armed patrols group outside the mall, people said they were upset about the killing of George Floyd, saying they support peaceful protests but are against rioting and wanted to show their support for law enforcement, the Journal reported. The Defend RCPD/Rapid City Facebook group was founded by Kenneth Dirk, 38, from Rapid City, who spoke out against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who is accused of Floyd’s death. “If you talk to anybody in the country, that was wrong,” Dirk said.

He mentioned footage of unarmed protesters doing the same in Sioux Falls as some other protesters began to throw rocks at officers.

The businesses that News 8 spoke with are not upset about the protest. They are upset with the damage and the timing of it all, leaving many wondering if they are going to be able to recover. “It is very, very difficult to walk through my city and see nothing but boards on windows,” said Danielle Cooney, owner of Soupremacy in downtown Indianapolis. Cooney considers herself lucky, with only one glass panel damaged from the riots over the weekend, allowing her store to remain open. But not everyone is as fortunate. “After they gained access to my store, they were coming and going for hours, and I was watching the door swing open and closed like this was the public restroom. I mean, people just came and they went and just as freely as they wanted to,” said Greg Bires, owner of Windsor Jewelry Store. Bires’ store had only been back open for three days due to the coronavirus restrictions before rioters broke in and looted his store on Friday and Saturday nights. The second time, someone broke through the boards that replaced the broken windows from the first night. “It was like, ‘What do you do?’ You are helpless and that was probably one of the things that hurt me the most — is that we couldn’t stop it,” said Bires. One thing that these two business owners want to make clear is that they are not upset with protesters who are peacefully demanding change. “I want the protesting. I want people to be able to protest. I also don’t believe the protesters are the ones who are breaking my windows,” said Cooney. With stores not only across Indianapolis but across the country in need of glass, businesses are expecting yet another delay due to high demand. “I am not comfortable taking the boards down even though we didn’t have any rioting last night. I don’t know when we are going to feel comfortable taking them down,” said Cooney. Businesses were already struggling from the pandemic. Now Windsor Jewelry, which has called Indianapolis home for more than 100 years, says they don’t know how much more they can take. “I have always been told that when you open a restaurant, that if you can make it. We have been here for six years, and I am scared that we won’t make it,” said Cooney.

Trump made the statement before leaving the White House Saturday afternoon for Florida to watch the SpaceX launch. He was talking about using military forces in Minnesota to help quell protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Floyd died when a Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd down to the ground by his neck for nearly nine minutes after taking him into custody last Monday. The incident was seen worldwide on video. During the video, Floyd could be heard pleading, ""I can't breathe."" In the nights since, protests have expanded from Minneapolis to other cities in all 50 states, leading to an increased police presence in many cities and call-ups of the National Guard in more than 20 states to help keep order. In a conference call with the nation's governors on Monday, Trump called many of them weak, saying they should request the U.S. Military Forces to put down civil unrest in their cities. However, the use of the armed forces to act as a police power on American soil is actually illegal. It was outlawed by a law enacted in 1878. The Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385), limits federal powers when it comes to using military personnel to enforce domestic policies inside the United States of America. A second federal law, the Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. § 251), was adopted in 1807. That law would permit him to deploy troops under an executive powers act, if there is a determination that an insurrection is taking place, and a governor or state legislature were to request that type of assistance. Thus far, no governors have requested this type of assistance. They have, instead, relied upon the National Guard, which has been called out in more than 20 states to assist local law enforcement. Governors prefer to use the National Guard for these types of functions since they are legally permitted to perform law enforcement duties in the United States. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits active members of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, or even the newly created Space Force from intervening in a law enforcement capacity on US soil. If Trump were to invoke the Insurrection Act, he would, however, be able to deploy active-duty troops without a request from a governor. In order to do so, the president would have to first issue a proclamation which would ""immediately order the 'insurgents' to disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time."" The last time that the Insurrection Act has been used was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots, when the move was requested by then-California Gov. Pete Wilson and invoked by President H.W. Bush. Prior to that, it had not been used since the 1960s civil rights era.",0.0

In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night, when protesters were expected to gather again. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, said the official, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said there are already some active-duty forces in the area, but they are not in D.C. They are prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops are in the region now. The officials said some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing military deployments. ------ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Sign up here. Hong Kong police on Monday blocked a candlelit vigil marking the anniversary of China’s deadly military 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. The police said it rejected the organizers’ request for a candlelight vigil because it would violate coronavirus social distancing rules that ban gatherings of more than eight people. Hong Kong has reported five local infections of the coronavirus in the last two days, breaking a nearly two-week streak of no new cases outside of those brought in from abroad. The rejection would be the first time in 30 years that the vigil, which normally draws a huge crowd to an outdoor space, is not held in Hong Kong. The decision follows a vote by China's ceremonial parliament to bypass Hong Kong's legislature and enact national security legislation for the semi-autonomous territory. Democracy activists and many legal experts worry that the law could curtail free speech and opposition political activities. The events prompted hundreds of residents to apply for passports that could allow them to move to the United Kingdom. Throngs of people lined up at DHL courier outlets across the city Monday to send documents to the U.K. to apply for or renew what is known as a British National (Overseas) passport. ""My BNO passport expired in 2004, but at the time I didn't renew it because I trusted China,"" said 40-year-old Peter Chan, who works in asset management and waited in line for more than two hours. Chan said he was worried about political and security issues in Hong Kong stemming from the national security law as well as a push by the territory's legislature to enact a bill that would make it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem. Even though there is rising anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiment in the U.K., ""it's still better than Hong Kong,"" he said. ""In Hong Kong, you never know what will happen tomorrow.” HELEN RALEIGH: WELCOME HONG KONG POLITICAL REFUGEES – 3 REASONS US SHOULD ACT NOW The rush to apply for passports came after Britain said last week that it might allow holders of the document to stay in the country for a year or more. The proposal came after China's legislature decided it would enact a national security law for Hong Kong. The move is aimed at clamping down on a pro-democracy movement that has at times resulted in violent clashes between protesters and the police. Critics say the law erodes the ""one country, two systems"" framework that promised Hong Kong freedoms not found in mainland China for 50 years. Protesters demonstrated against the security law at lunchtime Monday at a luxury shopping mall in the Central business district. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The British National (Overseas) passport, which was issued to Hong Kongers when it was a British colony, allows them to visit the country for an extended period but falls short of offering them citizenship rights. As of February, nearly 350,000 Hong Kong residents held BNO passports, although the U.K. government estimated that there are 2.9 million people in the city of 7.5 million who are eligible for the passport.

By Evan McMorris-Santoro, Kevin Brunelli and Theresa Waldrop, CNN (CNN) -- The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, has been fired after officials discovered two police officers involved in fatal shooting of a man during a protest over George Floyd's death had not activated their body cameras. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said on Monday. ""Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD)."" Fischer identified the victim as David McAtee, a local business owner. Protests, sometimes violent, have erupted across the nation after Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died while being arrested in Minneapolis last week. In Louisville, the protests have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician who was shot multiple times when three LMPD officers entered her apartment by force to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. McAtee was shot as police and the National Guard were trying to disperse the protesters, police said Monday. The officials returned fire after they were shot at. ""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man."" ""They've nurtured so many people in their bellies and in their hearts before, and for him to be caught up in this, not to be with us today is a tragedy."" The Louisville Metro Police Department and National Guard units were sent to clear a large crowd in a parking lot around 12:15 a.m., the police chief said early Monday. ""Officers and soldiers begin to clear the lot and at some point were shot at,"" Conrad said at a press conference. ""Both LMPD and National Guard members returned fire, we have one man dead at the scene."" The Louisville shooting happened in the far western part of the city, where protests hadn't taken place in previous nights. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said state police will also investigate McAtee's death. ""Given the seriousness of the situation, I have authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the event,"" Beshear said in a statement. Russell Coleman, US Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, also said on Twitter his office has started an investigation, which will be carried out alongside the FBI Louisville office and state police. Odessa Riley, a woman who was at the scene Monday, told CNN the shooting victim was her 53-year-old son. ""They killed him for no reason,"" Riley said through tears. Riley said she got a call a little after 1 a.m. that her son had been shot and killed, and she came to the scene and had been there since. ""All I want to do is just see my son before they bring him out, that's all I want."" Riley said. She said she hasn't heard anything from the police and was told to wait for the coroner. McAtee, nicknamed ""Yaya,"" was ""trying to make an honest dollar to take care of his rent and his bills,"" Riley said. ""And they gonna shoot him down like a dog, uh, uh, I don't appreciate that."" McAtee had told his mother that he fed police officers at the restaurant. Mayor Greg Fischer met briefly with Riley Monday where she stood in the crowd, close to where McAtee was killed. Fischer prayed for her, Riley said, and ""I broke down and started crying, but he, the Mayor Fischer, he's a good person."" Peace, not violence, is what she wants, Riley said. ""The protesting is good, protest, for the other people to get what they deserve to,"" Riley said. ""They killed my son. My son don't mess with nobody."" ""My son didn't do nothing,"" she said. Investigators are interviewing several people ""of interest"" and collecting video from the scene of the shooting, the police chief said. More information is expected to be released Tuesday, Conrad said. Last week, seven people were shot in the downtown area in protests related to Taylor's death after audio was released of Taylor's boyfriend's call to 911 the day of her death. Fischer said the shots came from the crowd, not the police. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.",0.0

By Josh Campbell and David Shortell, CNN (CNN) -- Federal authorities have charged an Illinois man for civil disorder, carrying on a riot and possession of unregistered destructive devices associated with recent clashes between violent protesters and police in Minneapolis. In videos allegedly posted to his Facebook account on May 29, Matthew Lee Rupert, 28, was seen passing out explosive devices to other rioters and encouraged them to throw the devices at law enforcement officers, according to the criminal complaint released Monday. After handing an explosive device to another rioter and telling the person to throw it at police SWAT officers, the complaint states that Rupert is heard on video saying ""He's throwing my bombs,"" adding, ""He's going to bomb the police with them."" After an audible explosion is heard, Rupert is heard saying, ""Good shot my boy,"" according to the complaint, as well as, ""F*** 12,"" a derogatory phrase often directed at law enforcement. On one video, the complaint alleges Rupert asked for lighter fluid, entered a Sprint cell phone store, and is later heard on video saying, ""I lit it on fire."" On May 31, the criminal complaint said Rupert posted Facebook videos depicting himself in Chicago. In one video, Rupert is heard saying, ""Let's start a riot,"" and ""I'm going to start doing some damage,"" according to the complaint. He is then seen on video entering a convenience store and placing items in his backpack, according to the complaint. Rupert was arrested early Sunday morning by Chicago police officers after allegedly violating the city's emergency curfew order, the complaint states. After searching his vehicle, authorities found several destructive devices, according to the complaint. He was subsequently transferred into federal custody, according to a Justice Department statement. Court appearance In a court appearance Monday, Rupert appeared to be incredulous at the charge he's facing for possessing an explosive device. ""A firework?"" Rupert responded to Chicago federal Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, who had asked him to acknowledge the crime he was being accused of. ""You may disagree with it but this is what the charge says,"" Pallmeyer said. ""Yes, ma'am, I understand the charge,"" he said. Prosecutors say Rupert filmed himself passing out the device at a protest in Minneapolis. ""I've got some bombs if some of you all want to throw them back,"" Rupert says in a video that he posted on Facebook, according to an affidavit from an FBI agent included in a charging document. The agent described the device as a ""commercial item with a cylindrical container, hobby fuse and a main charge capable of exploding."" It had a brown casing and a green wick, according to the affidavit, which does not refer to it as a ""firework."" Rupert did not officially enter a plea to the charge or the other two he faces during the brief initial appearance, which was held via telephone because of court closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. He agreed to remain in custody and be transported by US marshals to Minnesota, where he is charged. His public defender said he would challenge his detention once there.

Floyd, 46, died Monday night after a police officer pressed his knee against his neck for more than eight minutes. Footage released of the incident showed Floyd shouting, “I cannot breathe” and, “Don’t kill me.” In a video that went viral on Twitter, the civilians were captured holding automatic rifles outside of a local business in St. Paul, near Minneapolis — where Floyd died in police custody. CALIFORNIA LIQUOR STORE OWNER USES AR-15 TO PROTECT HIS PROPERTY FROM LOOTERS IN GEORGE FLOYD UNREST “Run up here and see what happens. … You see that? Black owned,” a person recording the video was heard saying as he highlighted the locally owned businesses Thursday. “Run up in this b—- or my momma we’re gonna do that to ya a–*” The video was retweeted by an account called The Official Grand Master Jay, a man who reportedly leads a group called the Not F—ing Around Coalition (NFAC), which is described as an all-black militia comprised of mostly ex-military shooters, according to Reason Magazine. It reportedly has upwards of 15,000 members. He has been using his social media accounts to showcase the group’s armed protests, the magazine reported. Armed white civilians have also been captured on social media protecting businesses with high-powered weapons following the looting in the Twin Cities. People self-described as “Free America” were seen armed with assault rifles stood outside a tobacco store on Wednesday, as protests — originally peaceful — turned chaotic. Fires, looting, and destruction were originally reported in area. Riots have spread nationwide in recent days.

Meanwhile, the brother of George Floyd told ABC News he wants justice handed to the officers responsible for his brother’s death, but as violent demonstrations are currently wreaking havoc in many cities across the country, he feels they are not what his sibling would have wanted. “Don’t tear up your town, all of this is not necessary because if his own family and blood is not doing it, then why are you?” Terrence Floyd told the news organization.

He tries to keep the crowd peaceful. Just tonight, when a car stopped on Clinton and began to block traffic at the Courthouse, he told the crowd to move to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Bridge and separate from the car – so police could see the protesters weren’t stopping the road. He hoped for a repeat of what happened Sunday and police say no arrests were made on Monday. “The fact that we stayed peaceful, the police even came and marched with us,” says AlienNature. “We had three officers who came and marched down the bridge with us. They held up our signs with us. It was nothing but love. Once we can do a peaceful protest then we can finally have love and unity because this isn’t about the people against the police.

She asked officers that very question, however Fort Wayne Police Department did not have an answer. “A lot of the responses that I got were ‘we do not have a clear answer’.

The first windows were broken at about 8:30 p.m. Friday as sources indicate two of the mayor’s top officials were advising IMPD Chief Randy Taylor and his staff at a command center as to their expectations of a moderate police response as a peaceful march against racial injustice quickly spiraled into chaotic mayhem that led to widespread looting, fires and vandalism before dawn Saturday. If, as one IMPD source indicated, Friday night was a “probing raid” for protestors to observe police response tactics, Saturday night the lid came off of downtown Indianapolis after another massive peaceful rally. “Frankly, we were having discussions all day Saturday with protest organizers,” said Hogsett, “and while no agreements were made, while no guarantees were extended, I had reason to believe that by my request that the protests run from 4 p.m. to 7 or 7:30 would be honored. That is what we were hopeful for. It didn’t happen the way we wanted it to happen.” While hundreds of peaceful protestors left downtown, others remained and continued marching and chanting and were joined by newcomers after the official rally was concluded. “And unfortunately, there are those who remained or came down after the sun went down who decided to engage in vandalism, looting and other forms of criminal activity,” said Hogsett. As dusk settled in, and the crowd’s enthusiasm and volume grew, downtown streets became choked with traffic as car horns and radios blared and motorists added their voices to the chorus of opposition to police brutality that led to the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer last week. What followed were assaults on the City County Building, several downtown bank branches, a report of a fire at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the torching of a CVS Pharmacy that burned the night before, the re-looting of the TJ Maxx store and several clothing merchants, dumpster fires in the middle of Pennsylvania Street, broken windows at the building housing the Marion County Prosecutors Office, a second night of burglary at Circle Centre Mall, smashed glass on the Indiana Convention Center and the Indiana Repertory Theatre and damages to more than one hundred businesses and buildings downtown in losses that are yet to be calculated, effectively destroying and closing the restaurant and retail sector of the city’s core that was already crippled by more than two months of shutdown ordered by the mayor and the Marion County Public Health Department in an attempt to protect residents from the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, friends, family and the community mourns the death of former IU football player Chris Beaty was shot to death Saturday evening near Talbot and Vermont Streets as the rioting raged throughout downtown. IMPD sources report that the investigation of a second murder hours later at Market and Pennsylvania Streets was cut short as the presence of rioters endangered officers and evidence technicians at the scene. Saturday night’s second riot compounded the destruction to businesses and buildings left untouched by the Friday night violence. Only when Governor Eric Holcomb directed Indiana National Guard troops to assist the Indiana State Police in securing state property in downtown Indianapolis, and Hogsett instituted an 8 p.m. curfew countywide and travel restrictions Sunday night, was the city quiet for the first time since Friday evening. “Enough is enough,” said ISP Superintendent Doug Carter in explaining the deployment of state assets to secure Indianapolis. During his first in-person briefing with reporters since late March, Hogsett was asked, after witnessing the Friday night riots, why he didn’t call for a curfew and the blockage of traffic in the Mile Square before Saturday’s rallies. “To the extent that a curfew was considered, it certainly was for Saturday, but a judgment was made that perhaps with cooperation and collaboration we could avoid the violence that had unfortunately been in the city on Friday night.” Hogsett then shifted responsibility for the tactical crowd management decisions that were made before Saturday night’s riot to IMPD. “I don’t make the decision about shutting down traffic,” the two-term mayor of Indianapolis said. It should be noted that IMPD, in consultation with mayors, has always advised or acceded to executive directives, to close downtown streets to traffic for parades, festivals, sporting events and, in the wake of widespread violence several years ago, during Indiana Black Expo’s Summer Celebration. (In a related note, The Original Farmers’ Market, which traditionally shuts down Market Street in front of the CCB on Wednesdays in the summer, and was recently moved to a closed section of Monument Circle, will not resume until June 10.) Hogsett, who prefaced his Sunday curfew announcement with claiming a lesson he learned as the former U.S. Attorney for Southern Indiana was to trust law enforcement, focused his Monday briefing with the press on directing Chief Taylor to undertake internal affairs investigations into complaints that officers might have overstepped their bounds or used inappropriate force in restoring order to the streets. Taylor acknowledged that his staff had reviewed video of questionable incidents and apologized for any protestors who inadvertently suffered the effects of tear gas intended to disperse unruly crowds. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears announced he would not pursue charges against 41 people arrested for non-violent crimes during the protests and riots afterwards but is still in the process of considering burglary counts against 14 individuals charged with looting. Mears concluded his press release by advising, “Allegations of improper conduct or procedural violations by members of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department should be directed to the Citizens’ Police Complaint Office. The Citizens’ Police Complaint Office is an independent city office which provides an avenue for complaints against sworn officers to be investigated. To file a complaint with that office, please complete the online form or contact the office directly at (317) 327-3440 or cpco@indy.gov.” Meanwhile, a review of arrest records continues to determine the extent of suspected outside influence into the Indianapolis unrest by groups and individuals from other states. Monday afternoon, Solomon Franklin, 21, recounted 18 hours he spent inside the Marion County Jail following his arrest ten minutes after Mayor Hogsett’s 8 p.m. curfew went into effect Sunday. “I was walking home with my girlfriend and her friend, I work at Kroger, I’m an essential worker, I had my skateboard, they locked us up for walking home. “We were out of downtown, and they pulled up on us all and arrested us. “They all just pull up on us out of nowhere, like about five cars. They take us in. The jails are horrible.” Franklin said his curfew violation charge was dropped. As merchants and restaurants took stock of the damage two days of rioting left on their businesses, Bob Scultz, senior V.P. of marketing for Downtown Indy Inc., told FOX59 “Right now, our number is at 112 street level businesses surrounding Monument Circle, going down South Penn, South Meridian toward Mass Ave., all the way back down toward Georgia Street and the church St. John’s, the Convention Center, Banker’s Life Fieldhouse area… all points in our central business district that have seen great devastation. And the question remains… is it over?” Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard rolls back plan to sue City of Minneapolis The City of Carmel, the wealthiest community per capita in Indiana, quoted Mayor Jim Brainard in warning, “Carmel has retained outside legal counsel and is planning to take action against the City of Minneapolis for negligence for the expenses incurred protecting our community as a result of the actions by police in Minneapolis.” He added that but for the negligence of the police department in that city, many communities, including Carmel, would not have incurred the costs of responding to the resulting riots and looting. “I encourage other cities to join us in this lawsuit for recovery of our costs. Those in power need to understand the far-reaching consequences of their actions,” said Mayor Brainard. Carmel Police vehicles were spotted on the streets of Indianapolis before dawn Saturday in a cooperative agreement to support IMPD as it struggled to retain a sense of calm to the city after the first night of rioting. Then, some six hours after the City of Carmel’s original news release, a second statement was issued, rolling back the mayor’s threat to sue Minneapolis for additional police costs.",0.0

They're all filled with National Guard troops. By Barbara Starr, Ryan Browne and Nicole Gaouette, CNN (CNN) -- Defense officials tell CNN there was deep and growing discomfort among some in the Pentagon even before President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is ready to deploy the military to enforce order inside the United States. As tear gas wafted through the air in Lafayette Park across from the White House, Trump announced from the Rose Garden that if state or city leaders refuse ""to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" he will invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder. But some Pentagon officials are deeply wary, several defense officials tell CNN. They have tried to respond by making a strong case that the situation does not yet call for deploying active duty troops unless state governors make a clear argument such forces are needed. ""There is an intense desire for local law enforcement to be in charge,"" a defense official said, alluding to the laws that forbid the military from performing law enforcement roles inside the United States. There is also discomfort with the civil order mission among some National Guard troops -- more of whom are now mobilized inside the US than at any previous time in history. A military response ""I believe that we in America should not get used to or accept uniformed service members of any variety having to be put in a position where they are having to secure people inside the United States of America,"" Army Maj. Gen. Thomas Carden, the Adjutant General of the Georgia National Guard, told reporters Sunday. He added that although ""while we are glad to do it and honored to do it, this is a sign of the times that we need to do better as a country."" Trump is threatening to use the Insurrection Act as US cities across the country struggle to deal with protests and, at times, looting and rioting that began last week after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who was being taken into custody by police in Minneapolis. The President, who faces a climbing death toll from the coronavirus pandemic and uncertain reelection prospects in November, is now emphasizing law, order and a military response against American citizens. On Monday, Trump intensified his rhetoric about using military forces to ""dominate"" protesters and wished aloud there was an ""occupying force"" in cities across America during a call with governors where he urged a tougher response to protests. Later, the National Guard fired tear gas and rubber bullets at a peaceful crowd outside the White House. A group comprised of service members who hold civilian jobs and train part-time, the National Guard are usually deployed in their home states by governors or the federal government who decide the length of each mission. They can perform law enforcement actions when under the command of state governors unlike the active military, which is forbidden by law from doing so unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act. 'The bottom of my list' Carden described the mission of reinforcing local authority by saying that, ""of all the things I've been asked in do in the last 34 plus years in uniform, this is on the bottom of my list."" Speaking of his experience in Georgia, he acknowledged that the circumstances ""called for it,"" and said that he believes the National Guard presence ""had a significant deter and calming effect."" Defense Secretary Mark Esper, taking part in the call Trump held with governors Monday, said there are now more than 17,000 National Guard in 29 states and the District of Columbia, surpassing the 51,000 called up for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Another 45,000 are supporting efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Another defense official described an ""escalation ladder"" of steps that could be taken to scale up federal, state and local enforcement, but emphasized that any use of active duty forces would be very much at the end of those options. But the Trump administration has already put an active duty military police battalion on a shorter response time in and around Washington on Monday, three US defense officials tell CNN. The troops, consisting of some 200 to 250 military personnel from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, are expected to provide security, but not perform law enforcement duties such as the arrest and detention of protesters, according to the defense officials. An additional 600 to 800 National Guard members from five states have also been requested to supplement the DC National Guard responding to civil unrest and could arrive as early as Monday night, according to defense officials. 'Total domination' Trump signaled the violent political theater that played out in Washington on Monday night in the call with governors earlier in the day, in which he promised a demonstration of ""total domination."" ""We're going to clamp down very, very strong,"" Trump said. ""The word is 'dominate.' If you don't dominate your city and your state, they're gonna walk away with you. And we're doing it in Washington, in DC, we're going to do something that people haven't seen before ... But we're going to have total domination."" In the Rose Garden, as loud bangs were heard and demonstrators ran screaming, Trump said he was taking ""swift and decisive action"" to protect Washington by dispatching ""thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property."" He also said that he had ""strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" If cities or states fail to act, Trump said, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

We have lost count of the images of violence, and the absurdity and heartbreak a man dying by a police cruiser one week ago tonight. Peaceful protest is our right. But is it under attack from outside forces that don’t represent who we are? Is the issue of discrimination that has been with us for centuries being shoved aside? Joining me live is Courtney Johnson, founder and executive director of Young and Established. Courtney, good to see you. In some ways for you, this is deja vu. You went to Ferguson, Missouri, after the riots there some six years ago. We talked about that here in the studio. How are you processing what we have been seeing the past week since we saw that heartbreaking video of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis. Courtney Johnson: The video, it was hard to watch. To be honest, I cried. And it was a tough video to watch. And with everything that’s going on, you and I had just talked about the same thing last year ,and here we are again. So it’s tough to see things continue to happen. And I just have a lot of emotions right now. And it’s just, it’s tough. It’s a tough situation BB: And Courtney, the looting and the rioting, has the tragedy been lost in this? CJ: I know people are talking about the rioting, you know people are angry and I’m all for protesting. Of course the rioting and damaging people’s property, that’s tough. People are tired and people are angry. So it is hard to watch. These things continue to happen and I don’t agree with it, but I understand. I know people are frustrated. Again just it’s tough to see. And it’s hard to continue to talk about these things and not see anything happen. BB: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today said people have hijacked these demonstrations taking away the right to a peaceful protest. What do you think Courtney? CJ: Evansville did a great job. We had a very peaceful protest, everybody that put that together. I’m speaking from my experience in Evansville, our community and what we’re doing to move forward because I live here. I know everything that’s taking place here in Evansville, and all across our nation right now is just, again, as far as the riots, I don’t agree with it. But I understand that people are frustrated so I know where that’s coming from. I hope people just have peaceful protests and people come together. And that’s what they did on Saturday. Evansville definitely came together. And I felt like we were united. BB: mothers and fathers have said when their sons were young boys, they grew up fearing they could be in danger any time when they went out. Did you go through that? CJ: Yes, sir. I still go through it. I’m 31 years old, and I still have my parents that are concerned and scared and I don’t have any kids on my own. But I mentor, young black men, and it’s scary for me to have these talks with them. I don’t want to see anything like this happen to them, or to my friends, or a loved one. And I saw some comments, I saw a few people say they’re tired of seeing Black Lives Matter. They’re tired of seeing this stuff. Can you imagine how we feel dealing with racism? I mean, we’re tired of it and we have to deal with this every day. These are things that I deal with right here in our community. I deal with racism every single day. And people don’t hear that side of me. I’m the positive guy. And I really do a lot of things in the community and I never really talk about some of the things that I deal with on a day to day basis here in Evansville. I’m 6’4, I’m black. I’m a threat. I’ve been told that before, from people here, right here in my community, that I’m a threat. And it’s scary that those are things that we have to face every single day and things that we have to deal with. Racism is something that has continued to just show his ugly face. And I don’t know, I’m just tired of it, I’m tired. BB: You know, Courtney, when we did that audio check about 45 minutes ago, and we brought you up on Skype, I could tell. I’ve known you for about six to seven years and I could just tell that this has really had an impact on you, that it all has an impact on you. But this in particular, and with that said, why would you tell a very agitated young man who is black or any young man or woman of color about the injustice of all that? And what advice would you give that person? CJ: Let your voice be heard. I think it’s important for all of us to do our part, everybody. And that’s, that’s what I would tell you got to let your voice be heard. You have to stand up for what’s right. Whether people like you or support you or not, I know that I have a nonprofit, there were people that contacted me and were worried about some of those things. I don’t care about any of that. If you don’t want to support me because of my beliefs and what I stand for, then you shouldn’t support me at all. I don’t want that type of support and we don’t want that type of support at all, but I would just tell them to let your voice be heard. BB: If there’s any ripple of hope, a ray of hope, we’ve seen images and we saw one again tonight. This one I believe up in Indianapolis where officers were joining protesters, peaceful protesters in unison, showing their support and showing you know, there can be love between them and the people that they are sworn to protect. How does that impact you? CJ: Even though I’ve had my experiences with police brutality right here in Evansville, Indiana, I think I’ve shown that as well. Not just me, but Young and Established with Evansville Dustbowl, together with Stop the Violence rallies, things that we put together. Even though I’ve had my experiences and I still have my experiences and things that make me uncomfortable, but I still reach out and do my part. And again, I think it’s important for all of us to do our part and it’s just a tough situation. BB: It is indeed. Courtney Johnson, young man, you take care of yourself, stay safe and we will talk to you soon.",0.0

A tally of arrests during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday was not immediately available. Police planned to release that information later Monday, said Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He said the city “was relatively quiet” during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. Several hundred people took part in a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon that started at the Indiana Statehouse. The group marched several blocks to outside the City-County Building, where those taking part laid on the ground while the names were read off of African Americans who have died in confrontations with police. The overnight curfew imposed by Mayor Joe Hogsett came after peaceful protests gave way later to unrest and destruction. The death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer used his knee to pin Floyd’s neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, has sparked protests nationwide. Hogsett announced Monday that he was extending the city’s curfew order for an additional night. His new order will begin at 8 p.m. Monday and will end at 4 a.m. Tuesday — two hours earlier than the mayor’s first order — because Tuesday is Indiana’s primary election, with voting starting at 6 a.m. Hogsett’s order also includes an exception allowing people to travel during the curfew period for “election-related activities.” The mayor said in a statement that he was “proud of our residents, the vast majority of whom abided by Sunday night’s curfew order.” “My thanks go out to the men and women who helped keep Indianapolis peaceful overnight,” Hogsett said. Two people died amid several shootings late Saturday and early Sunday, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. Police said no officers had fired their guns. One of those fatally shot was Chris Beaty, who was a defensive lineman on Indiana University’s football team from 2000 to 2004 and has recently managed Indianapolis nightclubs, The Indianapolis Star reported. Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting Saturday night a few blocks from downtown Indianapolis’ Monument Circle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Young said the circumstances of Beaty’s fatal shooting remained under investigation. “It’s still early on in the investigation and I don’t believe we have any suspects at this point. We have very limited information,” he said Monday morning. Beaty recently launched Worldwide Masks — a company that sells one-piece face coverings to prevent the spread of germs, with fellow entrepreneur Joe Babish, The Indianapolis Star reported. Indiana University football coach Tom Allen said in statement Monday that he was stunned by Beaty’s death and heartbroken for his family. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating. Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me!” Allen said. “His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” Large protests happened elsewhere in Indiana on Saturday, with police in Hammond using tear gas to break up protesters and officers blocking marchers from going onto Interstate 80/94. Fort Wayne police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd after Friday night’s demonstration resulted in some protesters throwing rocks at officers and breaking dozens of windows on downtown businesses.",0.0

Gov. Eric Holcomb, meanwhile, said the state National Guard would remain on duty to help protect local communities from violence that he said “has taken on a tone of organized crime.” Holcomb said it was a “noble” cause for protesters to gather to exercise their First Amendment right by decrying Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody. But he said “troublemakers” had no right “to destroy, vandalize or threaten another Hoosiers’ safety or property.” The governor said members of the Indiana National Guard would remain on standby for now to assist local communities, including Indianapolis, from the threat of more violence and would move them and other resources as needed to any “flash points” of violence that may erupt. “We’re taking it day by day and processing intelligence as it comes in. And we will move the required resources to the places where it’s needed,” Holcomb said during a Statehouse news conference. “This unprecedented scale of threat and violence toward businesses and people is something that has drawn us to this position.” Indiana State Police have deployed hundreds of state troopers around the state, to Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, South Bend, Evansville, Hobart and other cities “to help them with civil unrest,” said Doug Carter, the agency’s superintendent. Another crowd of protesters gathered in downtown Indianapolis for the fourth straight day Monday afternoon for another protest over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody — a death that has sparked protests nationwide. The handcuffed black man died last weekend after a white officer used his knee to pin Floyd’s neck down for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Large protests happened elsewhere in Indiana on Saturday, with police in Hammond using tear gas to break up protesters and officers blocking marchers from going onto Interstate 80/94. Fort Wayne police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse a crowd after some protesters threw rocks at officers and broke dozens of windows in downtown Fort Wayne businesses. Indianapolis police arrested 115 between Friday night and early Monday, with most of those arrests coming during the violence early Saturday and early Sunday, said Officer William Young, a spokesman for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He said some people were arrested for violating the curfew Mayor Joe Hogsett had imposed from Sunday night through Monday morning to quell violence, but that number was not immediately available. Overnight Sunday into Monday was “relatively quiet” in the city, Young said, after eekend protests during that saw demonstrators break dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. Hogsett announced Monday that he was extending the city’s curfew order for an additional night. His new order will begin at 8 p.m. Monday and will end at 4 a.m. Tuesday — two hours earlier than the mayor’s first order — because Tuesday is Indiana’s primary election, with voting starting at 6 a.m. Hogsett’s order also includes an exception allowing people to travel during the curfew period for “election-related activities.” The mayor said in a statement that he was “proud of our residents, the vast majority of whom abided by Sunday night’s curfew order.” “My thanks go out to the men and women who helped keep Indianapolis peaceful overnight,” Hogsett said. Two people died amid several shootings late Saturday and early Sunday in Indianapolis, though it wasn’t clear their deaths were related to the protests. Police said no officers had fired their guns. One of those fatally shot was Chris Beaty, who was a defensive lineman on Indiana University’s football team from 2000 to 2004 and has recently managed Indianapolis nightclubs, The Indianapolis Star reported. Beaty, 38, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in a shooting Saturday night a few blocks from downtown Indianapolis’ Monument Circle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Young said the circumstances of Beaty’s fatal shooting remained under investigation. Indiana University football coach Tom Allen said in statement Monday that he was stunned by Beaty’s death and heartbroken for his family. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating. Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me!” Allen said. “His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.”",0.0

CARMEL, Ind. — A central Indiana mayor has pulled back his threat to sue Minneapolis for costs his city suffered while ""responding to the resulting riots and looting"" in the wake of George Floyd protests. Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard initially announced Monday that the city had retained outside legal counsel to take action against the city of Minneapolis. He had claimed the negligence of the Minneapolis Police Department has left Carmel and other cities with the ""costs of responding to the resulting riots and looting."" The mayor had even encouraged other cities around the country to join his potential lawsuit. But just a few hours later, Brainard backtracked and said he's putting the lawsuit idea ""on hold."" ""I still feel that the Minneapolis Police Department was recklessly negligent, given the officer’s disciplinary history, in allowing him to remain in uniform patrolling the streets of Minneapolis,"" Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard said in a statement Monday evening. ""My intent was to send a message that their negligence cost many lives and millions in property damage across the country."" Earlier in the day, Brainard explained how his city had to quadruple the number of officers on patrol over the weekend after there had been social media posts encouraging people in the city to protest Saturday night ""and destroy areas of Carmel."" While Saturday night stayed mostly peaceful in Carmel, the mayor said that a few widows were broken at a store. ""America has a long history of correcting behavior though the legal system and I felt this would be another opportunity to do so,"" Brainard said Monday night. ""This is not about inflicting more pain to the good people of Minneapolis. It is about sending a message to its leaders and to leaders of across the U.S. that we will no longer tolerate the violence and damage that results from their inability or unwillingness to treat all people with respect,"" Brainard added. Protests and demonstrations have been ongoing nationally since last week, and has also led to violent rioting and looting. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) tweeted Monday morning that law enforcement officers made 276 arrests Sunday into Monday.

Join us in protesting Minneapolis resident George Floyd's death, the crowd responded, according to Tippecanoe County Sheriff Bob Goldsmith. Together — police and protesters — kneeled in solidarity at the corner of Fourth and South streets. The crowd applauded and cheered, and the night of police chasing protesters around the blocks near the Tippecanoe County Courthouse in downtown Lafayette with gas and pepper spray ended. The atmosphere between the two groups changed. The police tactical teams rode back to their staging area, where they took a break. Crowds of protesters headed toward the courthouse square, where the night before, violent protesters broke windows, spray painted the limestone walls of the 19th-century building and threw an explosive device at the courthouse entrance. Deputies kept the crowds on the opposite side of the street from the courthouse, and the crowds complied without the taunting and cursing that was seen earlier in the night's event. When police initially arrived on the scene in force just before 9 p.m., they moved protesters off of the courthouse square, pushing a large crowd east on Columbia Street. As the crowd began to meander closer to the police picket line, officers again pushed them back towards the other end of the block. Officers warned peaceful protesters who remained on Fourth Street that tear gas was about to be fired into the larger crowd and the wind would blow the gas back towards them. When police fired gas, the crowd stampeded around the corner. The running protesters rallied on Fourth Street near South Street — and began pushing back towards the courthouse. Police pushed them back to a standoff at Fourth and South streets until the shortly after 11 p.m. That's when the police and protesters joined in solidarity by kneeling. The night might have ended well, but it wasn't without incidents. Five adults and one juvenile were arrested.

Others were protesting with signs, including one that read ""I can't breathe"" and some yelled, ""What's my name?"" The protesters chanted, ""George Floyd!""

Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. “I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual “walkout” to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers “took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country.” Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,” tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. “I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,” Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's “decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.” “I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,” she continued.",0.0

Many said cleaning felt cathartic during a dark period for a nation battling the coronavirus pandemic, the job losses that followed and now the worst racial unrest in half a century. Bill Stuehler donned a mask Sunday and marched with a fellow nurse and other activists in Los Angeles, later trying to stop young people from breaking into stores. At home, he kept watching the violence on live feeds and fell deeper into despair. So before sunrise, the 66-year-old grabbed brooms, a rake and a trash shovel and drove to nearby Long Beach to clean up the mess. Soon, more than 2,000 people were working side by side, scrubbing, filling trash containers and repairing what they could in the hard-hit city south of Los Angeles. “It was pretty amazing to see the number of people turn out for the community,” Stuehler said. “It restored the faith in humanity that I had lost last night.” Throngs of people nationwide volunteered to help businesses – from small shops to major chains – bounce back from the damage, though some stores had burned to the ground and another night of unrest was expected. In New Jersey, Chris DeLeon, broom in hand, arrived at 8 a.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass in the capital of Trenton. The 34-year-old protested Sunday, then decided to help clean up after seeing videos of people smashing windows. “It just goes to show there's at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,” DeLeon said. In Wisconsin, volunteers in Milwaukee and Madison turned up for a second day to clean up damage. Countless businesses already had taken a hit from restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and were starting to reopen just as the protests led to more expensive setbacks: vandalism and stolen merchandise. The owner of the Laugh Factory's club in Long Beach discovered broken windows and doors, computers smashed and memorabilia stolen, including Three Stooges posters and autographed photos of Redd Foxx and other late comedians. Workers boarded up windows and swept up broken glass Monday. Owner Jamie Masada was offering an unspecified reward to anyone who returns the memorabilia. “It is not worth anything to them, but it means a lot to me,” Masada said, because it's tied to those who represent “the height of comedy.'” In Sacramento, two-thirds of the capital city's 600 downtown properties took a hit, with more than 200 broken windows, 330 pieces of graffiti, and more than 50 cases of “significant property damage,” said Michael Ault, executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she didn't recognize downtown when she walked through it Sunday, “but what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” Stuehler found the same community spirit in Long Beach. A nurse who had been treating COVID-19 patients, Stuehler took the month off when he joined the protest. He said a small percentage of people vandalized businesses but “the horror of the opportunism, the rage, the disregard for logic and reason – it was shocking.” They had an outsize impact that detracts from the message of overhauling police agencies, Stuehler said. But he said he's feeling revived after seeing so many people work together. Alycia Barber also was moved to help after watching from her Long Beach apartment as people smashed windows and police doused the crowds with pepper spray Sunday. The 22-year-old got up early and joined others organizing clothing and jewelry strewn inside a Forever 21 store, hours after thieves made off with armloads of merchandise. Few of the volunteers knew each other; they just showed up, she said. There were parents with children, senior citizens, college students. One woman brought paint and brooms so people could paint over graffiti on the outside wall of a parking garage. “I just feel so helpful today,” Barber said, adding that she supports the fight against racial injustice. “But now we also want to get up and make the world a beautiful place for people.”",0.0
1622896740,2020-06-02 01:00:00,US criticized by adversaries,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/world/20200602/us-criticized-by-adversaries,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the U.S. in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people. “To the American people, the world has ... heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran. As people marched in solidarity with U.S. protesters across the globe, Washington's adversaries have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, ... not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That's particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong's anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That's as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America's 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien's allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump's assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” As in other locations around the globe, thousands of people who packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs.",0.0

The civil unrest over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police combined with the coronavirus pandemic that's disproportionately striking African Americans sparked an urgent plea for understanding from some leaders as the world watches a nation in turmoil. Notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell read into the Senate record the names of black people who have died at the hands of the police. George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. “To me,” McConnell, R-Ky., said in a speech in the Senate chamber, and to “millions of outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents. They look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal just and equal protection under the law a fact of life for all Americans.” House and Senate lawmakers swiftly began drafting legislation to address police violence and confront the inequities facing black Americans. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., proposed a sweeping overhaul of law enforcement procedures. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., pushed to establish the first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation, backed by a civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. House Democrats, working from home from because of health risks convening during the pandemic, met over a lengthy conference call on next steps. The protests hit a nation already in crisis over the virus outbreak and economic shutdown that has left 41 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits as Congress struggles to respond. The House approved a new $3 trillion rescue package from Democrats, but the Senate had no immediate plans to consider a fresh round of relief. Instead, Senate Republicans focused on kick-starting the economy and eliminating a $600 unemployment benefit to push Americans back to work when jobs return. They also want to develop a liability shield to protect businesses that do reopen from lawsuits related to COVID-19. A bipartisan group of economists called on Congress on Monday to provide $1 trillion in additional aid to states and cities, on par with the House-passed bill. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said roughly 3 million state and local government employees could lose their jobs in the next year – in addition to the nearly 1 million that have already been laid off. “This is about as close to a no-brainer that you could do as possible,” Glenn Hubbard, an economist at Columbia University and a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, said on the conference call organized by the liberal Economic Policy Institute.

Trump said he was recommending that governors deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets.” If governors fail to take action, the president said, he will mobilize “thousands and thousands” of U.S. soldiers and “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We're going to keep it safe.” Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and the Minneapolis death of George Floyd. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters Monday to remain peaceful. The demonstrators in Lafayette Park were cleared so that after his brief statement, Trump could walk across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in one of the protests. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. On Monday, police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What's his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. “If I'm not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that's not going to bring my brother back at all.”",0.0

Throngs of protesters took to local streets Friday, Saturday and Sunday to protest police brutality and the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being detained by a Minneapolis police officer last week. Protests in Fort Wayne on Friday and Saturday began peacefully but took a chaotic turn as demonstrators clashed with police, who used tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse the crowd. Sunday's demonstration was more peaceful, as protesters and police talked to one another near the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Bridge north of downtown. In a statement Monday, Mayor Tom Henry said the city “continues to mourn” Floyd's death and condemned what many see as systemic racism among the law enforcement community. “Racism has always been wrong, still is wrong, and should never be tolerated,” Henry said. Henry defended actions taken by the Fort Wayne Police Department and other law enforcement agencies during the weekend's demonstrations, however. Protests on Friday night and throughout the day Saturday became chaotic as – in an effort to disperse the crowd – city, county and state law enforcement personnel – many dressed in riot gear – deployed tear gas and other aggressive measures. Law enforcement officers at the scene, Henry said, “had to make difficult decisions that they believed were necessary to maintain order and the overall safety of all residents.” “I know concerns have been expressed about the actions of public safety personnel,” he said. “I support the work that they did. The techniques that had to be used are no reflection and not in opposition to the message that was trying to be conveyed by protesters.” Those arrested Friday and Saturday were ordered held without bond, pending a hearing, by Allen Superior Court Judge Fran Gull. Hearings were held Monday, and bond was set at $1,000 for Indiana residents and $5,000 for those from out-of-state. A list of names provided Sunday to The Journal Gazette by the Fort Wayne Police Department showed a total of seven people arrested over the weekend were from outside Indiana. Friday's arrest total was 29; Saturday added 68. Ten people were arrested Sunday, police said. Most of them are Fort Wayne residents, and most of the charges filed were misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct and refusal to leave an emergency area, according to court documents available Monday. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana urged state and local law enforcement “to respect demonstrators' First Amendment rights and avoid making arrests or using force, including tear gas, unless necessary to protect human life.” “Tear gas has been banned in warfare and should never be used against peaceful protesters exercising their constitutional rights,” said Jane Henegar, the organization's executive director. “The deployment of military personnel and excessive force used against protesters only escalates the risks to all.” Also Monday, Gov. Eric Holcomb condemned Floyd's death, but decried reports of property damage and looting in several Indiana cities and municipalities throughout the nation. “Make no mistake about it: No citizen has a right to destroy, vandalize or threaten another Hoosier's safety or property,” Holcomb said. “Coordinated efforts of breaking and entering, shooting at law enforcement officials and starting fires have taken on a tone of organized crime and will be responded to accordingly.” Holcomb added that the state “will continue assisting local communities with the needed state resources to enforce the rule of law and protect lives and property. “Our state police and National Guard will occupy positions that defend all law-abiding citizens' rights,” he said. “Only then as a state and a nation can we make progress on systemic problems that have, for too long, eluded our true, and aspired to, national identity. Indiana seeks to be a leader on this front, not just with more talks and in our town halls, but in our actions and agenda revolving around inequity and disparity at the city, state and national levels.” Indiana House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said in a statement he stands with “those voices calling for systemic change.” GiaQuinta also attended a Fort Wayne vigil for justice and peace Sunday. “It is important that all Hoosier leaders use this time to listen and learn,” he said. “It is my hope that the voices calling for change will choose to remain peaceful and that peaceful voices will not be met with excessive force, both in Fort Wayne and other cities across Indiana.” GiaQuinta added that it is important for Hoosiers to work together to understand and combat systemic racism. “We must continue to fight institutional racism in our state and nation if we are going to move forward together,” he said. “Unfortunately, we know that we have a long way to go.” Priests in the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend have been asked to provide a special “Mass for the Preservation of Peace and Justice” this week, Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades said in a statement Monday. “Let us pray for the eternal repose of the soul of George Floyd, for his family, for all victims of racial injustice and for the many good men and women in law enforcement who serve with honor and who respect the human dignity of all whom they serve,” he said. Racism, Rhoades said, “is a pervasive social evil” that must be eradicated. He also decried instances of rioting and looting. “In many cities across our nation, including in Fort Wayne and South Bend, people have gathered to rightly protest the killing of George Floyd and the injustices suffered by African Americans in our country,” he said. “Sadly, violence has broken out at protests in many places. Rioting and looting only cause further injustice. Violence solves nothing and causes further harm.” Rhoades called for substantive societal changes “beginning with a commitment to respect for the life and God-given dignity of every human person.” “Let us pray that God will heal our society and help our nation to put an end to the destructive evil of racism and an end to violence in our communities,” he said. In his statement, Henry agreed, adding that “Fort Wayne Police Department and my administration support peaceful protests and demonstrations.” “Today, I hurt along with so many in our great community as we come to grips with the real pain that so many are experiencing,” he said. “It's critical for all of us to come together united with a commitment to gaining a better understanding of the divisions in our city, state and country. We're now presented with the opportunity to reflect and move forward to determine how we can unify around one another to prevent traumatic incidents from happening in our city. Open dialogue and trust will help us get to where we need to be.” Protesters were once again lining up along Clinton Street outside the Allen County Courthouse Monday afternoon for a fourth day of protests. As of 5:30 p.m., the demonstration remained peaceful. dgong@jg.net Matthew LeBlanc contributed to this story.",0.0
1622916617,2020-06-01 23:07:08,Mayor Hogsett defends decisions during Indianapolis’ weekend riots,https://fox59.com/news/mayor-hogsett-defends-decisions-during-indianapolis-weekend-riots/,en,False,,89515,fox59.com,http://fox59.com/#spider,"INDIANAPOLIS — Emerging from the safety of his home or his 25th floor conference room at the City County Building for the first time during more than three days of raucous protests that led to violence, murder and the trashing of downtown Indianapolis, Mayor Joe Hogsett defended the decisions he made during a weekend when peaceful protests turned into riots that rocked the core of Indiana’s capitol city. The first windows were broken at about 8:30 p.m. Friday as sources indicate two of the mayor’s top officials were advising IMPD Chief Randy Taylor and his staff at a command center as to their expectations of a moderate police response as a peaceful march against racial injustice quickly spiraled into chaotic mayhem that led to widespread looting, fires and vandalism before dawn Saturday. If, as one IMPD source indicated, Friday night was a “probing raid” for protestors to observe police response tactics, Saturday night the lid came off of downtown Indianapolis after another massive peaceful rally. “Frankly, we were having discussions all day Saturday with protest organizers,” said Hogsett, “and while no agreements were made, while no guarantees were extended, I had reason to believe that by my request that the protests run from 4 p.m. to 7 or 7:30 would be honored. That is what we were hopeful for. It didn’t happen the way we wanted it to happen.” While hundreds of peaceful protestors left downtown, others remained and continued marching and chanting and were joined by newcomers after the official rally was concluded. “And unfortunately, there are those who remained or came down after the sun went down who decided to engage in vandalism, looting and other forms of criminal activity,” said Hogsett. As dusk settled in, and the crowd’s enthusiasm and volume grew, downtown streets became choked with traffic as car horns and radios blared and motorists added their voices to the chorus of opposition to police brutality that led to the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer last week. What followed were assaults on the City County Building, several downtown bank branches, a report of a fire at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the torching of a CVS Pharmacy that burned the night before, the re-looting of the TJ Maxx store and several clothing merchants, dumpster fires in the middle of Pennsylvania Street, broken windows at the building housing the Marion County Prosecutors Office, a second night of burglary at Circle Centre Mall, smashed glass on the Indiana Convention Center and the Indiana Repertory Theatre and damages to more than one hundred businesses and buildings downtown in losses that are yet to be calculated, effectively destroying and closing the restaurant and retail sector of the city’s core that was already crippled by more than two months of shutdown ordered by the mayor and the Marion County Public Health Department in an attempt to protect residents from the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, friends, family and the community mourns the death of former IU football player Chris Beaty was shot to death Saturday evening near Talbot and Vermont Streets as the rioting raged throughout downtown. IMPD sources report that the investigation of a second murder hours later at Market and Pennsylvania Streets was cut short as the presence of rioters endangered officers and evidence technicians at the scene. Saturday night’s second riot compounded the destruction to businesses and buildings left untouched by the Friday night violence. Only when Governor Eric Holcomb directed Indiana National Guard troops to assist the Indiana State Police in securing state property in downtown Indianapolis, and Hogsett instituted an 8 p.m. curfew countywide and travel restrictions Sunday night, was the city quiet for the first time since Friday evening. “Enough is enough,” said ISP Superintendent Doug Carter in explaining the deployment of state assets to secure Indianapolis. During his first in-person briefing with reporters since late March, Hogsett was asked, after witnessing the Friday night riots, why he didn’t call for a curfew and the blockage of traffic in the Mile Square before Saturday’s rallies. “To the extent that a curfew was considered, it certainly was for Saturday, but a judgment was made that perhaps with cooperation and collaboration we could avoid the violence that had unfortunately been in the city on Friday night.” Hogsett then shifted responsibility for the tactical crowd management decisions that were made before Saturday night’s riot to IMPD. “I don’t make the decision about shutting down traffic,” the two-term mayor of Indianapolis said. It should be noted that IMPD, in consultation with mayors, has always advised or acceded to executive directives, to close downtown streets to traffic for parades, festivals, sporting events and, in the wake of widespread violence several years ago, during Indiana Black Expo’s Summer Celebration. (In a related note, The Original Farmers’ Market, which traditionally shuts down Market Street in front of the CCB on Wednesdays in the summer, and was recently moved to a closed section of Monument Circle, will not resume until June 10.) Hogsett, who prefaced his Sunday curfew announcement with claiming a lesson he learned as the former U.S. Attorney for Southern Indiana was to trust law enforcement, focused his Monday briefing with the press on directing Chief Taylor to undertake internal affairs investigations into complaints that officers might have overstepped their bounds or used inappropriate force in restoring order to the streets. Taylor acknowledged that his staff had reviewed video of questionable incidents and apologized for any protestors who inadvertently suffered the effects of tear gas intended to disperse unruly crowds. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears announced he would not pursue charges against 41 people arrested for non-violent crimes during the protests and riots afterwards but is still in the process of considering burglary counts against 14 individuals charged with looting. Mears concluded his press release by advising, “Allegations of improper conduct or procedural violations by members of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department should be directed to the Citizens’ Police Complaint Office. The Citizens’ Police Complaint Office is an independent city office which provides an avenue for complaints against sworn officers to be investigated. To file a complaint with that office, please complete the online form or contact the office directly at (317) 327-3440 or cpco@indy.gov.” Meanwhile, a review of arrest records continues to determine the extent of suspected outside influence into the Indianapolis unrest by groups and individuals from other states. Monday afternoon, Solomon Franklin, 21, recounted 18 hours he spent inside the Marion County Jail following his arrest ten minutes after Mayor Hogsett’s 8 p.m. curfew went into effect Sunday. “I was walking home with my girlfriend and her friend, I work at Kroger, I’m an essential worker, I had my skateboard, they locked us up for walking home. “We were out of downtown, and they pulled up on us all and arrested us. “They all just pull up on us out of nowhere, like about five cars. They take us in. The jails are horrible.” Franklin said his curfew violation charge was dropped. As merchants and restaurants took stock of the damage two days of rioting left on their businesses, Bob Scultz, senior V.P. of marketing for Downtown Indy Inc., told FOX59 “Right now, our number is at 112 street level businesses surrounding Monument Circle, going down South Penn, South Meridian toward Mass Ave., all the way back down toward Georgia Street and the church St. John’s, the Convention Center, Banker’s Life Fieldhouse area… all points in our central business district that have seen great devastation. And the question remains… is it over?” Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard rolls back plan to sue City of Minneapolis The City of Carmel, the wealthiest community per capita in Indiana, quoted Mayor Jim Brainard in warning, “Carmel has retained outside legal counsel and is planning to take action against the City of Minneapolis for negligence for the expenses incurred protecting our community as a result of the actions by police in Minneapolis.” He added that but for the negligence of the police department in that city, many communities, including Carmel, would not have incurred the costs of responding to the resulting riots and looting. “I encourage other cities to join us in this lawsuit for recovery of our costs. Those in power need to understand the far-reaching consequences of their actions,” said Mayor Brainard. Carmel Police vehicles were spotted on the streets of Indianapolis before dawn Saturday in a cooperative agreement to support IMPD as it struggled to retain a sense of calm to the city after the first night of rioting. Then, some six hours after the City of Carmel’s original news release, a second statement was issued, rolling back the mayor’s threat to sue Minneapolis for additional police costs.",0.0
1622921568,2020-06-02 00:02:31,"Father Jenkins, it’s not enough.",https://ndsmcobserver.com/2020/06/father-jenkins-its-not-enough/,en,False,,113460,ndsmcobserver.com,http://ndsmcobserver.com/,"On May 30, the University of Notre Dame published “Statement by Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., President, University of Notre Dame, on racial justice” on its official news site. Fr. Jenkins begins by stating that “George Floyd’s tragic death cries out for justice and a recommitment to fight racism.” He follows this by reminding us of the fact that Fr. Ted Hesburgh, a previous Notre Dame president, once marched alongside Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Lastly, Fr. Jenkins reminds us to pray for “justice, solidarity and a healing of divisions.” And that’s all. Two sentences. Fifty-two words. The statement is just barely longer than the caption of the photo it accompanies, one that Notre Dame students have become accustomed to seeing on campus: a picture of Fr. Hesburgh standing arm-in-arm with Dr. King. This image is consistently used as a means to pacify the black students and alumni of the University. It is plastered on the walls of the LaFortune Student Center, posted on banners during Black History Month and used for every statement Notre Dame makes about race. Jenkins’s statement manages to say nothing of substance, yet speaks volumes about how Notre Dame views its black students. Where was the solidarity when a black student was attacked by NDSP and racist students on campus in November? Where was the solidarity when students protested this and were threatened with expulsion? This statement is a slap to the face for all of us who were expecting some form of support or solidarity. Instead, we got a 60-year-old photo that pretends to take a stance but means nothing today. Fr. Jenkins’s use of the memory of this isolated incident — preserved in a photo — enables the assumption that recalling the actions of a previous University president makes the current administration exempt from taking further action. So far, it seems as though Fr. Jenkins does not want to set an example; rather, he wants to unearth an example set by someone who looks like him and point at it from a distance. What is meant to be a statement on racial justice is instead a statement about the University’s refusal to effectively address anything that has taken place after 1964. Prayers and memories of past actions are no substitute for active solidarity. There are many steps Notre Dame can take, on a national scale and to show support for black students and alumni. First, we must acknowledge the disturbing acts of violence committed by police officers and the white supremacy that plagues our justice system in America. Second, we must recognize that the same issues are prevalent on Notre Dame’s campus to this day, and take action to address these. We must create a safe and inclusive environment for our black and minority students, faculty and staff, working alongside these members of the community to meet the needs and demands that have been ignored for far too long. If Fr. Jenkins is able to cite 1964 as a year that Notre Dame helped the nation make progress, then he should be able to acknowledge the following decades, in which the University has repeatedly failed its black students. If Fr. Jenkins is able to cite the death of George Floyd — just one of a painfully long list — as a cry for justice, then he should be able to make specific promises to aid in the deliverance of this justice, both nationally and within the Notre Dame community. If Fr. Jenkins is able to recycle a protest photo from one day that Notre Dame was on the right side of history in 1964, then he should be able to take a new protest photo — of Notre Dame being on the right side of history in 2020.

1622921563,2020-06-02 01:45:25,Observer Editorial: This problem cannot be prayed away. Do more,https://ndsmcobserver.com/2020/06/observer-editorial-do-more/,en,False,,113460,ndsmcobserver.com,http://ndsmcobserver.com/,"We’ve heard their names with a rumble of outrage from the White and tri-campus communities for years: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland — the list goes on and on. And now, George Floyd. For the Black community, outrage, activism and courage have been a permanent fixture. But now, it’s time for the White community — particularly, the predominantly White institutions with significant endowments, alumni and fans across the world — to use its platform to actively advocate for change. An NPR column called the past 10 years “A Decade of Watching Black People Die.” It’s true. But why are our schools still just watching? The Observer Editorial Board stands with George Floyd and all of our Black brothers and sisters. We would like to make it clear this does not make us any less objective as journalists. We do not consider Black members of our community being killed by police officers a political issue but rather one of human rights. We are so proud and hopeful to see millions across the world, and those in our own community, flooding the streets to march and protest for George Floyd and for Black lives. With that in mind, we ask why Notre Dame has not been more vocal on the issue, now and in the past decade. University President Fr. John Jenkins initially released only a two-sentence statement, with a predictable callback to the moment Fr. Theodore Hesburgh and Martin Luther King Jr. joined hands during a rally — nearly 56 years ago. He then announced a prayer and “walk” from the library to the Grotto to take place Monday evening. This is simply another version of the trite and ineffective “thoughts and prayers” tagline, and it is not the response we want. Holy Cross has remained silent, and we are disappointed in their obvious inaction and complacency. After days of silence save for a throwaway comment in an email Monday, Saint Mary’s released an email statement Tuesday at midnight. We applaud the College for its response, but we cannot look past the large amount of time it took for this committed, comprehensive message to be sent. We understand the College is in the midst of a presidential transition, but this does not excuse the delayed response to such a pressing and immediate issue. If Notre Dame continues to boast its position as a top-tier institution filled with world-class scholars, we must ask why the administration continues to ignore real-world topics including systemic racism and police brutality. If, as Jenkins professes, Notre Dame is a leader, why are we not taking an active and involved stance on racial injustice today, rather than advertising a photo from an entirely different era? Students have cited multiple on-campus racial incidents and injustices just in the past year; injustices and racist comments written and spoken on campus have gone largely ignored by leadership, leaving students to rally together with groups like End Hate at Notre Dame and the Saint Mary’s Black Student Association. The University’s previous reactions to the struggles of the on-campus Black community align with the administration’s reaction to the murder of George Floyd — weak and ineffective. In 2017, Saint Mary’s acknowledged and responded to race-related graffiti on campus, and we call on the current administration to keep the promises made in their late statement. Catholic social teaching emphasizes solidarity, care for the poor and vulnerable and the dignity of the human person. The University upholds these values in its participation in and funding of events such as the March for Life, yet it ignores them now. The Church and the tri-campus community prides itself on acting as a force for good in the world. But a one-hour prayer service is not enough. As Catholic institutions, we must acknowledge thoughts and prayers are not enough and lack substance for change. The tri-campus community, consisting of predominantly White institutions, has the privilege to largely ignore these issues. But we can no longer allow our community to ignore protests that have stemmed from our inability to consider hurting communities and hear their voices. These issues are not new. They have endured generations. It is a privilege and honor to stand with our brothers and sisters who have not yet seen the justice they so deserve. Notre Dame student government released a statement far longer and more comprehensive than any released by administrative leadership in the tri-campus community. For that, we thank them. But as we have said in prior editorials, we need to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. If the leaders of our institutions will not, we need to speak up. If you are ignorant to the issues and injustices facing the African American community, educate yourself. Support Black businesses, writers, creators and community members. And above all, when you see injustice, use your privilege to stand up against it. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “For years now I have heard the word ‘wait.’ It rings in the ear of every [African American] with piercing familiarity. This wait has almost always meant ‘never’ … Justice too long delayed is justice denied.” Although we may be forced to wait for our leaders to step up and hold themselves accountable as advocates for all life, the student body should not wait to acknowledge injustices. If we are to be true advocates for change, we must protest the injustices of the system. To those who have spoken up, thank you. For those who have not, why haven’t you? Recognize that feeling uncomfortable in these conversations is yet another indication of your privilege. It is not enough to offer thoughts and prayers in a civil rights issue. It’s complacency. Take action, and do not remain idle. Continue to honor George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade and the countless others who have lost their lives due to the color of their skin. Continue the conversations this movement has started. If we cannot rely on our leaders, let us, the student body, be the voice against racial prejudice.",0.0

(WANE) – Four weeks after its original date, Primary Election Day has arrived in Indiana, but it’s set to be one like many have never seen before. Between the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest, and a huge increase in mail-in voting, the day is sure to look different this year. In-person turnout is expected to be lower with exponentially more people voting early, absentee, or by mail-in ballot. It comes after Indiana made mail-in voting available to all Hoosiers for the first time. “We were expecting somewhere around 3,000 absentee ballots, and we’ve sent out over 38,000, and gotten over 33,000 back,” said Beth Dlug, Allen County Director of Elections. “It’s been an incredible response from our community in response to our request for them to vote by mail. We really got a great response for that, and we’re glad.” For those still voting in person, several health and safety measures will be in place at the polling locations Tuesday to keep voters and poll workers safe. Each voter will be given a glove to wear while using the polling pads, workers will be wearing face masks and shields, and hand sanitizer will be stationed throughout the polling areas. In Allen County, election officials have also drastically reduced the number of polling locations and moved them to much larger facilities to promote social distancing. This primary election, there are only 25 locations, compared to the usual 116. Another factor this election day is the ongoing civil unrest across the country surrounding protests over police brutality. However, local election officials said it shouldn’t be an issue here. “I believe that most of the protesting has been downtown, and it is targeted at government buildings, and we aren’t voting at any government buildings,” Dlug said. “I don’t anticipate that we’re going to have any issues with our polling locations. So I hope that we will not run into any kind of problems on election day.” Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. in Indiana Tuesday. Election officials suggest that you check your polling location before leaving the house because it has likely changed. They also remind you to bring a photo I-D to vote. Tuesday marks the largest slate of presidential primaries in nearly three months. Seven states are heading to the polls, creating a second “Super Tuesday” of sorts. The public will have to wait patiently for the results of the primary though, as counting the huge number of mail-in ballots will take longer than usual.",0.0

Rhoades “I share the following sentiments of my brother U.S. Bishops: “We are broken-hearted, sickened, and outraged to watch another video of an African American man being killed before our very eyes.” The tragic and senseless death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week, like that of Ahmaud Arbery this past February in Georgia, reminds us that the vile evil of racism still persists in our nation. Racism is a pervasive social evil that we must be committed to fighting and eradicating wherever we find it, in ourselves and in society. It is antithetical to our Christian faith which proclaims the dignity of every human person created in the image and likeness of God. In many cities across our nation, including in Fort Wayne and South Bend, people have gathered to rightly protest the killing of George Floyd and the injustices suffered by African-Americans in our country. Sadly, violence has broken out at protests in many places. Rioting and looting only cause further injustice. Violence solves nothing and causes further harm. Substantive changes are needed in our society to eradicate racism and racial injustice, beginning with a commitment to respect for the life and God-given dignity of every human person. Let us pray that God will heal our society and help our nation to put an end to the destructive evil of racism and an end to violence in our communities. I am asking our priests to offer the special ‘Mass for the Preservation of Peace and Justice’ on a day this week. Let us pray for the eternal repose of the soul of George Floyd, for his family, for all victims of racial injustice, and for the many good men and women in law enforcement who serve with honor and who respect the human dignity of all whom they serve.” Most Reverend Kevin C. Rhoades Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend * * *",0.0

CITIES SEE NEW LOOTING DESPITE NATIONAL GUARD RESPONSE The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that all the officers were rushed to the hospital and they were conscious and breathing. The injuries are believed to be non-life threatening. The paper reported that at 12:25 a.m. local time, “heavy gunfire” could be heard “coming from several directions downtown.” Fox 2 Now reported that earlier in the day, crowds formed outside the St. Louis Police headquarters in the city and police set up defensive lines around the perimeter. The relative calm in the city during the day gave way to violence in the city that included a 7-Eleven being looted and being set on fire. The report said that downtown businesses and construction sites were also set on fire. A press release from the police did not identify the exact location of the gunfire but said police were still under fire. Protests across the U.S. were sparked after the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. There were reports emerging on Monday night that police became the target of some anarchists.

Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them. But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. ___ WASHINGTON — The protest in the nation’s capital on Tuesday night lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd outside Lafayette Park near the White House was peaceful, polite even, as they protested the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Instead of the spray-painted tags, the protesters Tuesday favored colorful children’s street chalk, writing Black Lives Matter slogans on the asphalt in front of St. John’s Church. Protesters chanted and talked among themselves, most wearing masks, but not social distancing in the age of COVID-19. One protester, Mati Yiheyis, a 21-year-old college student at the University of Virginia, speculated that fears of coronavirus kept many older people away. When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. “It’s not what we’re about,” said protester George “T.J.” Pierce of Washington. The crowd started thinning out on its own after 8 p.m., an hour after a curfew went into place, although a core group of several hundred remained at the fence, chanting at the line of police and soldiers in riot gear on the other side. On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at St. John’s Church, known as the church of presidents. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. ___ LOS ANGELES — Thousands have taken to the streets of Los Angeles in peaceful protests Tuesday, and smaller demonstrations dotted other California cities while authorities renewed overnight curfews in LA and other areas that have seen clashes with police and groups of thieves wreck hundreds of businesses. There were several sizable demonstrations in Los Angeles and Mayor Eric Garcetti took a knee at one while in a crowd outside police headquarters. However, later in the day, hundreds gathered outside the mayor’s house and protested. Elsewhere in the city, police cordons backed by National Guard troops kept a tight watch on marchers in Hollywood, where hundreds were arrested a day earlier, and at a crowd of thousands at City Hall. In San Francisco, a mass of people marched up the Great Highway along San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. At San Jose’s City Hall, several hundred people showed up for a demonstration and speeches organized by the local branch of the NAACP. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott asked supervisors Tuesday to keep an overnight curfew order for at least the “next few days” to get ahead of people bent on using peaceful protests to pilfer stores and commit violence. Mayor London Breed ordered the 8 p.m. curfew Sunday following a night of thefts downtown, including at a major shopping mall where several fires were set. ___ MELBOURNE, Australia — Police are urging thousands of demonstrators planning to attend a protest rally in Australia’s second-largest city over George Floyd’s death to reconsider due to social distancing rules. Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius on Wednesday described the rally planned for Saturday as the largest mass gathering in Melbourne since pandemic restrictions were introduced in March. Public gatherings are limited to 20 people in Victoria state, and people must keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart. Australia has recorded 7,221 coronavirus cases with 26 in hospitals on Wednesday. There have been 102 deaths. Cornelius did not say whether police plan to fine protesters, but told reporters that “police would prefer people obey the law.” Police have not enforced social distancing regulations when thousands gathered peacefully in Sydney and Perth in solidarity with U.S. demonstrators and to protest against the over-representation of indigenous Australians in prisons. Protesters attempted to get around social distancing rules by demonstrating over an unrelated issue in their cars in Melbourne in April. But police fined 26 of them 1,652 Australian dollars ($1,145) each and arrested their organizer for breaching a ban on non-essential travel. That ban has since been lifted. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis school board has voted to end its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department following the death last week of George Floyd. The Star Tribune reports the vote was unanimous Tuesday. Minneapolis Public Schools will stop further negotiations with the Police Department. Schools Superintendent Ed Graff must come up with a new plan for school safety by the board’s Aug. 18 meeting. School board chairwoman Kim Ellison said in an interview that she values “people and education and life.” Ellison said she’s now convinced, “based on the actions of the Minneapolis Police Department, that we don’t have the same values.” The Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts have faced criticism over the use of school resource officers. Both districts have sought to transform the role to be more of a mentor than an enforcer. ___ BEIJING — An official Chinese Communist Party newspaper is hammering President Donald Trump’s call to send in troops to put down protests and rioting with an editorial published Wednesday entitled “Quelling Protests With Troops Self-Contradictory For US.” The paper, known as strongly nationalist and for its anti-American views, wrote: “This could be argued as the most extreme response to disorder among governments across the world.” “Then why did Washington arrogantly and unreasonably accuse other countries of quelling riots? Why did politicians in Washington overbearingly portray the U.S. as the beacon of democracy and human rights? Have they really not anticipated that the U.S. could one day confront the situation as it does today and that their previous big talk could become a slap on their face?” The editorial attacked the U.S. for continuing to criticize Hong Kong’s heavy-handed approach to sometimes violent anti-government protests, and for Beijing’s move to enact national security legislation for the territory, while the U.S. failed to respond earlier to the coronavirus pandemic and police now battle protesters on American city streets. “The hooligan nature of Washington makes it a complete nuisance,” the paper said. ___ WASHINGTON — The U.S. Park Police denied using tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators. Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement. Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House. Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church. ___ DALLAS — Former President George W. Bush criticized any effort to squelch protests of George Floyd’s death while in Minneapolis police custody. In a statement issued Tuesday by his office in Dallas, the former Republican president said he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.” Bush did not refer specifically toward President Donald Trump, but he called the harassment and threats toward African American protesters “a shocking failure.” “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. … Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said Tuesday that she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father who would never get to see his daughter grow up. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I’m here for my baby and I’m here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to continued demonstrations to protest the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. A statement from the governor’s spokeswoman said the action will unify command of local and state police, the Arkansas National Guard and the state Department of Emergency Management. The spokeswoman minimized the significance of the move, however. “This is a normal executive order issued when the National Guard is activated under state control in regard to civil disturbance. Under this executive order, sheriff offices and police departments maintain command and operational control of their respective jurisdictions,” Katie Beck said in her statement. Also Tuesday, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott expanded the city’s curfew a day after Arkansas authorities again used tear gas to break up protests outside the state Capitol. Scott said the city’s nighttime curfew will begin 8 p.m. ___ ATLANTA — Hundreds of protesters lingered on the streets of downtown Atlanta on Tuesday night ahead of another 9 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Authorities used armored vehicles to form a cordon at the state Capitol nearby. Bottoms has implemented the curfew every night, starting Saturday. As the curfew took effect, police and National Guard troops moved in, firing tear gas. The crowd quickly dispersed, and television footage showed police leading some people away in zip ties. ___ SEATTLE — Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed a large crowd protesting George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, telling them their “voices holding me accountable are important.” Tuesday was the fifth day of protests in the Northwest’s largest city over the death of Floyd in police custody. Monday’s protests were largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade, but citizen video showed the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Standing next to the city’s police chief at the downtown Emergency Operations Center, Durkan said she supported the crowd’s right to rally against injustice. “We want you to march, we want you to raise your voices, we want you to continue on your path of justice,” Durkan said over a microphone as the crowd listened, mostly in silence. “But we need you, please, to do it peacefully.” The mayor, a former U.S. attorney, then took questions from some in the crowd. ___ ST. PAUL, MINN. — Thousands of protesters gathered on the front lawn of the Minnesota Capitol as part of a youth protest for George Floyd on Tuesday afternoon. The crowd listened to speakers and periodically chanted slogans like, “Say his name: George Floyd.” William Ray, 22, said his protest was about more than just George Floyd’s death last week. His grandparents were civil rights activists in the 60s and also members of the Black Panther Party. “I grew up with an understanding of what needs to be done, growing up with them and seeing the change that they brought to the community. … America was built off of slaves — my ancestors. A lot of the systems that were in place then are still here,” he said. Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, of Blaine, Minnesota, said she’s felt disheartened by the “endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying.” Of the unrest that has gripped cities across the nation, she said, “there’s always going to be a breaking point.” “It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. ___ WASHINGTON — A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was “sickened” to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a “stunt,” Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump’s “disdain” for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump. ___ MIAMI — A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of “police brutality” are also common in Florida. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.” Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.” Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. — About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon’s demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, “they’re waiting on us to give up, they’re waiting on us to get tired, they’re waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.” A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON — Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said “What’s his name?” and the crowd replied, “George Floyd.” The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation’s second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department’s civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS — Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. — Citing George Floyd’s death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The state says it will investigate the department’s policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in “systemic” discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state’s human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of “I can’t breathe” until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn’t been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use “typical crowd control measures” against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he’ll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation’s capital Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. — Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0
1622996165,2020-06-02 04:23:44,Fourth day of protests ends with zero arrests,https://www.wowo.com/fourth-day-of-protests-ends-with-zero-arrests/,en,False,,304750,wowo.com,http://wowo.com/,"FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO): For a fourth consecutive day, protesters came to the Allen County Courthouse to speak out against incidents of police brutality against black Americans. But for the first time since the protests began, there were zero arrests that followed. Fort Wayne Police Department Public Information Officer Sofia Rosales-Scatena tells WOWO News while officers remained ready, they weren’t needed. “Protesters started to gather around 2pm today and peacefully left at 11pm after announcements that the courthouse park was closing. The Fort Wayne Police Department is grateful for everyone present and for their cooperation and peaceful protest.” It was a welcome change of pace, after police arrested 29 people Friday night, 68 people Saturday night, and 10 Sunday night.

Here’s what you need to know as you start your day … Cities nationwide see new looting as demonstrations over George Floyd’s death spiral out of control, 4 police officers shot in St. Louis Cities across the country reeled from new looting Monday night as nationwide demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis escalated out of control yet again, and President Trump vowed a tougher federal response. Multiple cities and regions have imposed nighttime curfews to quell destructive behavior and tense confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement after dark. Six states and 13 cities have issued a state of emergency, according to the Wall Street Journal. But it appeared the curfews had little effect Monday night. In New York City, dozens of arrests were made, police said, while hundreds of looters were seen breaking their way into downtown Manhattan businesses. In midtown, a group armed with sticks reportedly torched one business. Other stores such as Michael Kors, Kate Spade and Barnes & Noble were broken into as glass from broken windows covered the sidewalk, KABC-TV reported. In Herald Square, a busy intersection just blocks away from Madison Square Garden and the Garment District, hundreds of looters forced their way into a Macy’s department store in the presence of police. Several were taken out of the retailer’s New York flagship store in handcuffs. Authorities in St. Louis said early Tuesday that four police officers were shot during protests in the city’s downtown area and officers continued to be under fire. St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden told reporters that two officers were shot in the leg and one was shot in the foot. The other was shot in the arm. In Washington D.C., police fired flash-bang shells and rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters outside Lafayette Square, near the White House, shortly before President Trump spoke about the escalating violence across the country and visited St. John’s Episcopal Church, which was damaged during Sunday night protests. An explosion was later heard that reportedly came from a police car set on fire about two miles north of the White House. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, some people were seen actively defying a curfew by staying outside police headquarters. Police also fired nonlethal bullets and tear gas Monday after a crowd spilled onto Interstate 676, shutting down traffic in both directions. Several arrests were made.

Law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse the peaceful protesters prior to Trump’s visit, which drew harsh backlash from Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Tonight the President of the United States used the American military to shoot peaceful protestors with rubber bullets & tear gas them. For a photo op,” Clinton tweeted. “This is a horrifying use of presidential power against our own citizens, & has no place anywhere, let alone in America. Vote.” “He’s using the American military against the American people. He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets. For a photo,” Biden remarked. “For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together.” “The President of the United States tear-gassed peaceful protestors in order to clear the way for a useless photo-op outside the White House—just after vowing to activate the military against our own people. Lives and our democracy are in danger,” Warren said. During the brief visit at the boarded-up church, the president stood in front and posed for photographers while holding up a Bible. He was accompanied by several aides and officials, including Attorney General Bill Barr, daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. The removal of the protesters came as Trump vowed to take “immediate action” to mobilize “all available federal resources” to stop riots and looting across the country. He also threatened to deploy the military if states don’t send in the National Guard to the protests. Click here for more.

Baden, one of two doctors to conduct an independent autopsy that concluded that Floyd died of asphyxiation at the hands of local police on May 25, told Fox News that medics “tried to do CPR with him [Floyd] in the ambulance, but were unable to find a pulse. “He had a cardiac arrest and they tried to shock him and the shocks didn’t work,” Baden added. “He was dead before they put him on the stretcher … many minutes before he gets to the hospital.” According to the independent autopsy report released by Floyd’s family, he died of asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain. Preliminary results from the official autopsy, which were included in a criminal complaint against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin — who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes in the now-viral video — said officials had found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” On Monday, an updated autopsy report classified Floyd’s death as a homicide and listed the cause of death as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” Click here for more.

J.B. Pritzker responds to a question after announcing that three more people have died in the state from from Covid-19 virus, two Illinois residents and one woman visiting from Florida, during a news conference Thursday, March 19, 2020, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (CNN) — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday labeled President Donald Trump “a miserable failure” as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd. The Democratic governor made the comments moments after Trump declared himself “your president of law and order” as peaceful protesters just outside the White House gates were dispersed with tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets, apparently so Trump could visit a nearby church. The episode follows nearly a week of protests across the country that at times have turned violent over the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis. “The fact is that the President has created an incendiary moment here,” Pritzker told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront.” “He wants to change the subject from his failure over coronavirus, a miserable failure. And now seeing a moment when there’s unrest because of the injustice that was done to George Floyd that he now wants to create another topic and something where he can be the law and order president. He’s been a miserable failure.” Earlier Monday, Pritzker had confronted Trump during a video teleconference wherein the President urged state leaders to aggressively target violent protesters he said would only respond to a show of force. Pritzker told Trump the nation was craving a steady hand from the top, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN. “Rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse, people are experiencing real pain,” he said. “We’ve got to have national leadership calling for calm and legitimate concern for protestors.” “I don’t like your rhetoric that much either,” Trump fired back. “You could have done much better on coronavirus.” Recounting the exchange Monday evening, Pritzker said he was drawing attention to how Trump’s rhetoric “is inflaming passions around the nation” when he should be “calling for calm.” “It’s clear that he doesn’t listen to anyone that tells him the truth. I did tell him the truth. You know, this rhetoric, this inflammatory rhetoric is bad for the country. You know, when we had the riots in Ferguson, President Obama started to bring the temperature down. He talked about calling for calm. When, you know, when Martin Luther King was killed, Robert Kennedy stood up and talked about seeking justice, you know, and bringing the tension down within the country.” “This President doesn’t understand any of that,” he continued. “He probably hasn’t read any of that, knows no history, and doesn’t understand the job of the president to truly speak to the values of the nation.”",0.0

Cities like New York implemented curfews and tried to disperse crowds after some protests turned violent. WSJ reporter Tyler Blint-Welsh tweeted Sunday evening that NYPD officers “hit me in the face multiple times with riot shields and pushed me to the ground. I was backing away as request, with my hands up. My NYPD-issued press badge was clearly visible. I’m just sitting here crying. This sucks.” He lost his glasses and had pain in his ankle, he said. Blint-Welsh later tweeted that he was “home safe now just icing my ankle and trying to decompress.” CNN has reached out to the NYPD, Blint-Welsh, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Attorney General’s office for comment regarding the alleged assault. New York Attorney General Letitia James replied to Blint-Welsh’s tweet asking him to report the alleged event to her office. A CNN crew also made news for interactions with police while reporting on the protests against police brutality. Live on air Friday, CNN’s Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez were arrested in Minneapolis.

One of the big singles on that album is one of my personal favorites…”Bad is Bad”. Huey sang, “I said cool is a rule, but, sometimes bad is bad.” So, 36 years later, why do I recall the prophet Huey and his “Sports” album? Because, today, “Cool is a rule, but, sometimes bad is bad.” Most of us have viewed the video of the arrest in Minneapolis. My initial reaction to is to think, the act depicted was criminal. But I also believe we have a system in this country whereby everyone is innocent until proven guilty. For our system to work, some buy-in is important. My reason for presenting this is not to judge guilt or innocence but to suggest there are procedures to be followed. Allow me to also suggest there are differences between “protest” and “looting”. By definition, “protest” is a “statement or action expressing disapproval of, or objection to something.” “Looting” is defined as to “spoils or plunder taken by pillaging, as in war; anything taken by dishonesty, force, stealth, etc; a burglar’s loot.” My Webster’s Pocket Thesaurus tells me “protest” can be a noun; meeting, rally, demonstration or dissent. It can also be a verb; object, demur, disagree or oppose. My thesaurus also says “looting” could be referred to as plunder, steal, thieve, rifle or rob. As a young man, I can imagine my parents’ reaction if I walked into the house toting a “receipt-free” TV and a new pair of shoes. This once young man remembers the 60’s and I vividly recall the race riots that left large portions of many cities smoldering. I also remember the marches lead by the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who suggested non-violent means to achieve the greater good. Sixty-plus years later, I doubt anyone can recall the name of any individual who tossed a brick or looted a business but I would argue we do remember the efforts of Dr. King. He said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. The true neighbor will risk his position, his prestige, and even his life for the welfare of others. In dangerous valleys and hazardous pathways, he will lift some bruised and beaten brother to a higher and more noble life.” Lifting a bruised and beaten brother should not be confused with lifting something from a store shelf after using your cement block key. Are things perfect today? No. Are they better? Yes. But my life mantra has always been, “The cup is half-full.” My fear is that reasonable people of all ilks, outraged by the action of a Minneapolis police officer have had their focus muddied by other videos of folks ransacking businesses and defacing property that quite often belongs to all of us. I fail to find a clean connection between the two actions. Bad response to a bad cop. Anne Bradstreet said, “Authority without wisdom is like a heavy ax without an edge; fitter to bruise than to polish.” I’d like to share another observation I’ve had. “Protests” take place in the light of day’ Rioting, violence and vandalism prefer the dark of night. How much positive stuff in our lives happens after midnight? I would be so bold as to suggest very little. Some would argue that the actions we’ve viewed is nothing more than “civil disobedience”. By definition, civil disobedience is a noun, defined as “the refusal to comply with certain laws or to pay taxes and fines, as a peaceful form of political protest.” My trusty thesaurus suggests we can also substitute insubordination, defiance, insurgence, mutiny, revolt, rebellion or noncompliance for civil disobedience. I’m having a problem including folks walking out of retail establishments with items not paid for as somehow truly aiding a cause that needs discussed and acted on. How does it help? Cooler heads must prevail. Will they? Time will tell. Winston Churchill said, “Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing…after they have exhausted all other possibilities.” Well-stated Mr. Churchill! I’ve quoted a line from “The Ox-Bow Incident” when Walter Van Tilburg Clark states, “We desire justice, and justice has never been obtained in haste and strong feeling.” Another quote, this one anonymous reminds us, “Your problem isn’t the problem; your reaction is the problem.” So, to bring Huey Lewis and the News back into the discussion, remember, “Bad is bad.” The action that provoked the response was bad. But the response, the reaction, was also bad. If you can’t grasp that, this next quote from an unknown pundit will help. “Anyone who doesn’t think there are two sides to an argument is probably in one.” Do I have the answers? No. But I hate to see the real issue get blocked out by noise. This country has been through challenges and we will figure this out. Why do I know that? Because in just two days, tomorrow will be yesterday.",0.0

Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the Tuesday. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern: 5:43 a.m.: Peaceful protests in New York City devolve into night of looting  Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd devolved Monday night into jarring moments of vandalism, looting, fire and confrontation in New York. There were more than 200 arrests and widespread vandalism in Midtown Manhattan and along Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, much of which went down after the citywide 11 p.m. curfew. Luxury brands and big box retail stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side had windows smashed and spray painted. Many more retailers boarded up their storefronts, giving the heart of a vibrant city already shuttered for the virus the look of blight. There were also several reports of officers being hit by vehicles of protesters fleeing the scenes of vandalism and looting. 4:14 a.m.: Two police officers shot in Las Vegas in separate incidents Two police officers have been shot in separate incidents in Las Vegas as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. One officer was shot near the 300 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard and the other officer was shot about two miles away in the 2800 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. The condition of the two officers is currently unknown. Police have said the scene is active and have asked the public to avoid the areas. 3:22 a.m.: Four police officers shot in St. Louis on a night of violent protests St. Louis Police Chief Hayden John Hayden held a press conference regarding four officers that were shot amid protests last night. He confirmed that all four officers have non life threatening injuries. Two were shot in the leg, one was shot in the foot and the other was shot in the arm. Police Chief Hayden said that a peaceful protest began around 3 p.m. with a couple of thousand people in attendance but that sometime later a group of about 200 people started looting. The group reportedly ignited fireworks and set them off aiming at the officers. Hayden also said the officers, who he said exhibited restraint throughout the entire ordeal, also had gas thrown on them. That is when, he said, several officers, who were standing on the line, all of a sudden felt pain and realized that they had been fired upon with four of them being hit, according to Hayden. The Police Chief also confirmed that there are still reports of gunshots being fired in the city that they’re trying to get under control. The officers were taken to hospital and treated for their wounds. The investigation into who shot them is ongoing. 1:57 a.m.: LAPD Chief apologizes for equating looters with officers involved in Floyd’s death Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore apologized for a remark he made during a mayor’s press conference Monday afternoon where he said: “We didn’t have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd, we had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers … We didn’t have protests last night. We had criminal acts.” The comment was met with immediate backlash and Black Lives Matter LA called for Moore to be fired in a tweet. Several hours later, Police Chief Moore, amid much criticism, issued an apology on Twitter saying that he misspoke during the press conference. 12:44 a.m.: Protests mostly peaceful in NYC, Denver, Louisville New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted late Monday night that any unrest has calmed down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the site of clashes between protesters and police over the last few days. De Blasio said protesters were overwhelmingly peaceful on this latest night of demonstrations, but that some people during the evening caused some damage that won’t be allowed. In Denver, protesters at the State Capitol took a knee and observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence — the same amount of time Derek Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd’s neck before Floyd died. Only the sound of helicopters above and honking in the distance could be heard. Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer also said protests in his city were largely peaceful. The mayor said the peaceful demonstrations honored the memory of David McAtee, the local restaurant owner who was shot and killed by Louisville police officers early Monday morning. 12:27 a.m.: Streets quiet in nation’s capital The city of Washington, D.C., has been relatively quiet tonight compared to the violence of the past weekend, law enforcement and homeland security officials tell ABC News. Officials report sporadic disturbances in Chinatown, where tear gas was deployed near the Convention Center.

George Floyd protest live updates: Two police officers shot in Las Vegas in separate incidents Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesBy JON HAWORTH, ABC News (NEW YORK) — The death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day after he was pinned down by a white Minnesota police officer, has sparked outrage and protests in Minneapolis and across the United States. Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the Tuesday. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern: 5:43 a.m.: Peaceful protests in New York City devolve into night of looting  Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd devolved Monday night into jarring moments of vandalism, looting, fire and confrontation in New York. There were more than 200 arrests and widespread vandalism in Midtown Manhattan and along Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, much of which went down after the citywide 11 p.m. curfew. Luxury brands and big box retail stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side had windows smashed and spray painted. Many more retailers boarded up their storefronts, giving the heart of a vibrant city already shuttered for the virus the look of blight. There were also several reports of officers being hit by vehicles of protesters fleeing the scenes of vandalism and looting. 4:14 a.m.: Two police officers shot in Las Vegas in separate incidents Two police officers have been shot in separate incidents in Las Vegas as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. One officer was shot near the 300 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard and the other officer was shot about two miles away in the 2800 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. The condition of the two officers is currently unknown. Police have said the scene is active and have asked the public to avoid the areas. 3:22 a.m.: Four police officers shot in St. Louis on a night of violent protests St. Louis Police Chief Hayden John Hayden held a press conference regarding four officers that were shot amid protests last night. He confirmed that all four officers have non life threatening injuries. Two were shot in the leg, one was shot in the foot and the other was shot in the arm. Police Chief Hayden said that a peaceful protest began around 3 p.m. with a couple of thousand people in attendance but that sometime later a group of about 200 people started looting. The group reportedly ignited fireworks and set them off aiming at the officers. Hayden also said the officers, who he said exhibited restraint throughout the entire ordeal, also had gas thrown on them. That is when, he said, several officers, who were standing on the line, all of a sudden felt pain and realized that they had been fired upon with four of them being hit, according to Hayden. The Police Chief also confirmed that there are still reports of gunshots being fired in the city that they’re trying to get under control. The officers were taken to hospital and treated for their wounds. The investigation into who shot them is ongoing. 1:57 a.m.: LAPD Chief apologizes for equating looters with officers involved in Floyd’s death Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore apologized for a remark he made during a mayor’s press conference Monday afternoon where he said: “We didn’t have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd, we had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers … We didn’t have protests last night. We had criminal acts.” The comment was met with immediate backlash and Black Lives Matter LA called for Moore to be fired in a tweet. Several hours later, Police Chief Moore, amid much criticism, issued an apology on Twitter saying that he misspoke during the press conference. 12:44 a.m.: Protests mostly peaceful in NYC, Denver, Louisville New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted late Monday night that any unrest has calmed down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the site of clashes between protesters and police over the last few days. De Blasio said protesters were overwhelmingly peaceful on this latest night of demonstrations, but that some people during the evening caused some damage that won’t be allowed. In Denver, protesters at the State Capitol took a knee and observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence — the same amount of time Derek Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd’s neck before Floyd died. Only the sound of helicopters above and honking in the distance could be heard. Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer also said protests in his city were largely peaceful. The mayor said the peaceful demonstrations honored the memory of David McAtee, the local restaurant owner who was shot and killed by Louisville police officers early Monday morning. 12:27 a.m.: Streets quiet in nation’s capital The city of Washington, D.C., has been relatively quiet tonight compared to the violence of the past weekend, law enforcement and homeland security officials tell ABC News. Officials report sporadic disturbances in Chinatown, where tear gas was deployed near the Convention Center. City and federal law enforcement, as well as the military, has had a heavy presence on the city streets, with aircraft, including a Black Hawk helicopter, patrolling overhead.

1623115561,2020-06-02 05:59:55,Violence continues as Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.wane.com/news/violence-continues-as-trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide/,en,True,,94604,wane.com,http://www.wane.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after a carefully orchestrated declaration by President Donald Trump to send out the military and “dominate the streets,” American cities were engulfed in more violence and destruction that overshadowed peaceful protests demanding justice after generations of racism. In New York City, largely peaceful demonstrations were punctuated by people smashing storefront windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors to the storied Macy’s store on 34th Street, leaving the major Manhattan thoroughfare littered with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Just happened: a protest in a car run over a group of cops in Buffalo NY…Some of them might be dead  #BlackLivesMatter #protests2020 pic.twitter.com/UraxbRhMuV — Yousef NH (@YousefNH2) June 2, 2020 Demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day that Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the location where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest began to mount, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. The police chief in Louisville was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by security forces during unrest early Monday. Military helicopters flying dangerously low over crowds in Washington, DC pic.twitter.com/KmjMhRjCY1 — Michael Pegram (@MichaelNBC12) June 2, 2020 An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas, where police have made 338 arrests during three nights of violence that followed peaceful protests earlier in the day. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. The latest wave of protests came on the day that Trump portrayed himself as hard-nosed, law-and-order president and police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump emerged after two days out of public view and threatened in remarks from the White House Rose Garden that he would deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. The photo op was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. The nation has been roiled by violence over the death of Floyd for nearly a week. The protests come after years of seeking police reforms over repeated cases of minorities dying in police custody, and at a time when the country is already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, whose officers have made hundreds of arrests. The president, seeking his second term in office, demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos at the historic house of worship. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 2, 2020 Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.",0.0

However, when asked if it is possible that a vaccine will be made available by 2021, Facui said it was “aspirational, but it’s certainly doable.” The COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 6.1 million people across the globe and killed over 373,000. In the U.S., the virus has sickened 1.8 million people, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. As for the nation’s death toll, it is approaching 105,000. Fauci maintained that the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 striking this fall is likely and encouraged Americans to keep practicing social distancing measures and to wear a mask. Due to the protests, photos shows crowds of people standing close together with some not wearing masks — further stoking fears that, should a second wave hit, it could be stronger than the first due to the amount of people rallying for peace. In addition, health officials believe that high blood pressure — which affects 45 percent of the American population — could be a “silent killer” when combined with COVID-19. It has been noted that high blood pressure is a common thread among hospitalized patients. One study found that 63 percent of ICU patients with COVID-19 also had baseline hypertension. Because of that, researchers are looking into how the virus impacts the cardiovascular system and how it increases risk of severe symptoms for those with high blood pressure.",0.0

Teens and adults with the Central Indiana Youth of Christ along with Downtown Indy, a nonprofit that works to develop and market the area, set out around noon to scrub away messages left by individuals angered over the police killings of black Americans. Their first stopped was the former IBJ building at Pennsylvania and East Washington streets, where protesters had spray painted, ""No Justice No peace,"" ""Dreasjon Reed,"" Justice 4 Sean Reed"" and ""I can't breathe."" “We strategically planned to come down here and clean up our city,” Antonio Patton, 42nd & Post City Life director at the Central Indiana Youth for Christ, an organization that works with youth. The cleanup isn't the only effort aimed at helping the community rebuild. The protests are also spurring thoughts about how a business alliance can work to eliminate social and racial inequities. A strategic effort after a chaotic weekend On Friday and Saturday, peaceful protests were followed by rioting and violent clashes with police after sunset. Businesses were looted. Windows and doorways smashed. Fires set. By Sunday, Mayor Joe Hogsett instituted a curfew. Damage from the overnight riots are still being assessed. Early projections put it in the millions. The teens and Downtown Indy focused on cleaning up graffiti on the sides of buildings along Pennsylvania and Washington. Many Downtown businesses remained closed and boarded up as uncertainty lingered. About 20 teens, ages 14 through 18, took part in the initial graffiti cleanup. Patton said the cleanup was strategic. He said he's seen numerous images of opportunists causing the damage Downtown, overshadowing the messages of peaceful protesters and further endangering the black community. ""Black individuals are not putting this graffiti on the wall. There's multiple images of white people putting 'Black Lives Matter' and writing 'F 12' on the walls,"" he said. ""We as the black community are asking them, 'What are you doing? Why are you putting that up there?' because it looks like we put it up there."" ""When we come to protests, we protest in solidarity, without violence, without vandalism and without hatred,"" Patton added. ""We come to stand in solidarity because we have a plan and we want results and we're hurt about what happened to George Floyd. Not one time have we thought to throw a brick through black-owned businesses."" He said Michael's Soul Kitchen and a black-owned barbershop were vandalized along with national chains like Starbucks. None of the businesses had anything to do with what happened to Floyd, Patton said. The violence also resulted in the deaths of 38-year-old businessman Chris Beaty, who was fatally shot Saturday night. Adrian Echols, 24, is Patton's nephew. He said the violence was reckless. ""There's so many more ways that we can do this without messing up our city,"" Echols said, adding that individuals should attempt to change the political and criminal justice system from within. Javion Harris, 17, worked with Echols to scrub graffiti from the building. He agreed with Echols that the protests should have remained peaceful. James Holder, 16, just hoped elected officials heard the protesters cries for justice. Downtown Indy Inc.'s street ambassador team distributed cleaning supplies to the teens and followed up the scrubbing with a pressure washer. Buildings from Capitol Avenue to Mass Avenue were tagged. Bob Schultz, Downtown Indy's senior vice president of marketing and events, and Josh Pruitt, Downtown Indy's director of operations, said some of the paint may not be easily scrubbed away from buildings' surfaces. For now, the nonprofit is seeking estimates from impacted businesses on the cost of physical repairs and lost revenue. It's working with the Building Owners and Managers Association of Indianapolis to do that. It also remains to be seen if the cleanup was premature and if another round of damage could occur. ""It depends on if it's over. ... Sometimes another storm follows the storm you're cleaning up from,"" Schultz said. ""We'll keep cleaning up."" Opening behind boarded-up windows On what was supposed to be the first day for dine-in in Indianapolis after months of closure due to COVID-19, nearly every restaurant in the southern end of Mass. Ave. and near Monument Circle were boarded up. Garden Table, The Eagle, Bazbeaux Pizza, McCormick & Schmick’s seafood & Steaks, P.F. Chang’s, Rock Bottom and Yard House were among the at least dozens of restaurants closed. Oren Alexander, a manager at McCormick & Scmick’s, said originally the plan had been to open the restaurant on Monday because it has no outdoor seating. That idea was nixed after windows were broken during riots. Alexander said the restaurant would open once everything was cleaned up and fixed, but he didn’t know when that would be. Other restaurants remained boarded up, but opened anyway. “Now open” and a peace sign were spray painted on boards that covered the windows and door at Punch Burger on Ohio Street, as the business opened Monday. Likewise, Giorgio’s Pizza was open for dine-in and Soupremacy was open for carryout, both boarded up and located on East Market Street. Danielle Cooney, a manager at Soupremacy, stood outside next to a sign letting people know the small restaurant was open, even if boards covered up all the windows, including one that was broken over the weekend. But business wasn’t what it should have been, Cooney said. Nearby office buildings closed Monday as a precaution in case peaceful protests turned violent again. That means many of Cooney’s regulars weren’t all downtown. “This is not hurting me today,” Cooney said, pointing to protesters. “The riots of Friday and Saturday night have hurt the business.” Coordinated approach To assist businesses, Downtown Indy plans to add to its website a section where people can sign up to volunteer for future cleanups. It's also established the Downtown Indy Small Business Recovery Fund to collect and disperse monetary contributions to business in need. There are also other considerations that's forcing the nonprofit to reprioritize, Schultz said. ""It means that you kind of reprioritize your goal,"" he said. ""Our focus has been everything from food truck festivals to Downtown growth, attracting businesses and talent attraction and retention. But as with all things (on) Maslow's hierarchy of needs, sometimes you have to go back to the very basics of safety, security, belonging."" The nonprofit has a downtown agenda that addresses issues like homelessness and safety and security. It's partners with the National Urban League, Concerned Clergy, Black Expo and has prominent black board members. But Schultz says Downtown Indy feels it can step up and act as a bridge of communities. ""We've recognized that there needs to be a more coordinated approach to social inequities and inequalities,"" he said.

Join us in protesting Minneapolis resident George Floyd's death, the crowd responded, according to Tippecanoe County Sheriff Bob Goldsmith. Together — police and protesters — kneeled in solidarity at the corner of Fourth and South streets. The crowd applauded and cheered, and the night of police chasing protesters around the blocks near the Tippecanoe County Courthouse in downtown Lafayette with gas and pepper spray ended. The atmosphere between the two groups changed. The police tactical teams rode back to their staging area, where they took a break. Crowds of protesters headed toward the courthouse square, where the night before, violent protesters broke windows, spray painted the limestone walls of the 19th-century building and threw an explosive device at the courthouse entrance. Deputies kept the crowds on the opposite side of the street from the courthouse, and the crowds complied without the taunting and cursing that was seen earlier in the night's event. When police initially arrived on the scene in force just before 9 p.m., they moved protesters off of the courthouse square, pushing a large crowd east on Columbia Street. As the crowd began to meander closer to the police picket line, officers again pushed them back towards the other end of the block. Officers warned peaceful protesters who remained on Fourth Street that tear gas was about to be fired into the larger crowd and the wind would blow the gas back towards them. When police fired gas, the crowd stampeded around the corner. The running protesters rallied on Fourth Street near South Street — and began pushing back towards the courthouse. Police pushed them back to a standoff at Fourth and South streets until the shortly after 11 p.m. That's when the police and protesters joined in solidarity by kneeling. The night might have ended well, but it wasn't without incidents. Five adults and one juvenile were arrested. One of the arrested men told bystanders he was arrested for standing with his hands up yelling, ""Don't shoot.""

At various times Monday evening and into the night, protesters could be heard shouting ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace."" Others were protesting with signs, including one that read ""I can't breathe"" and some yelled, ""What's my name?"" The protesters chanted, ""George Floyd!""

By midnight, there was about 200 people standing on the sidewalk across the street from the courthouse. That compared to the estimated 1,200 people who attended a demonstration Sunday night outside the county courthouse. The atmosphere was more like a summer festival instead of a contentious protest.

Cleaning up their city. Isaiah Rodgers didn’t have such grand ambitions in mind when he and his friends took to the streets Sunday afternoon, less than 24 hours after riots — borne of the nation-wide protests against police brutality — ravaged parts of Tampa. The Indianapolis Colts rookie cornerback and 22-year-old black man doesn’t know what will mend race relations in America. He doesn’t know how to solve the scourge of police brutality. What he does know is that Tampa is his home, and he doesn’t want to see it destroyed. “We just wanted to help the community, and we had to start somewhere,” Rodgers told IndyStar on Monday. Sunday’s good deed gone viral started when a friend proposed the idea of going out into Tampa to start clearing up the damage cause by back-to-back nights of riots. More Colts coverage: The group started small, Rodgers said. It was just him, fellow NFL players and Tampa natives Auden Tate (Bengals) and Ray-Ray McCloud (Bills), as well a few of their friends from the area. Initially they’d planned to help clean up around a mall they frequented as kids. But when they saw much of the work already done, they walked across the street to a Champs Sports store that had been ravaged by a fire. The initial group of six or seven got to work, expecting the clean-up to take half a day. But then more people started to arrive. When word started spreading around town what was happening, Rodgers said, people started pitching in. Eventually, about 30 people helped clean up around the Champs. The work was finished in just two hours. “People were pulling up, bringing us gloves and wipes and masks and water,” Rodgers said. “Some police officers even came by and started clapping for us. It was a good vibe.” Even better was that they seemed to have inspired their community. In the hours following the clean-up, Rodgers' phone blew up with people asking when he next planned to volunteer — and whether they could tag along. He’s going back out, he assures them, and there’s plenty of work to be done. Rodgers admitted that at first, he didn’t take the protests very seriously. But then he started seeing buildings burning and the livelihoods of many being destroyed. “We’re all from the area, so we kind of took it personal,” Rodgers said. “You realize people are going to have to wake up in the morning and realize they don’t have a job anymore. They were already dealing with coronavirus — so a lot of them weren’t working, but now they really don’t have a job. It’s just making lives worse.” Rodgers understands why some feel the need to protest. The anger and anguish brought about by police brutality are feelings he probably understands better than most. “My father,” Rodgers said, “passed from police brutality, so some things hit me a little harder.” When Rodgers was 16, a police officer shot and killed his father, Craig Rodgers, after responding to a kidnapping complaint made on behalf of Craig Rodgers’ girlfriend. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Craig Rodgers was shot by officer John Morningstar after Morningstar said Craig Rodgers threatened him with a pipe and charged at him. Morningstar was not charged in the shooting. Rodgers doesn’t see the merit of hate. “Look, I’m not running around saying, ‘Death to the police,” Rodgers explained. “(To make an impact), you have to continue doing the positive things, so at least you try to make them like us in some way. If that’s what you gotta do it; that’s the way you gotta do it.” If there’s one message Rodgers could get to all of those enraged by the injustice of racism and police brutality, it’s do everything you can to prevent letting that anger evolve into destruction. “When you get to burning down places … that’s not protesting anymore. Not in my eyes,” Rodgers said. “And we all felt that way about it. We wanted to show the community and we kept saying this (Sunday), ‘Let’s clean, not destroy. That was our motto yesterday. My main thing is to make people around me better. That’s what I care about. “I don’t think people realize it, but there are a lot of people who want to come together and help. That’s what we wanted to show. That’s what we why we did what we did.” Follow IndyStar Colts Insider Jim Ayello on Twitter: @jimayello.",0.0
1623241604,2020-06-01 14:59:50,Colts coach Frank Reich: 'Our black community has bore the brunt of this injustice for far too long.',http://rssfeeds.courierpress.com/~/625775104/0/courierpress/sports/colts~Colts-coach-Frank-Reich-Our-black-community-has-bore-the-brunt-of-this-injustice-for-far-too-long/,en,False,,25609,courierpress.com,http://www.courierpress.com,"INDIANAPOLIS – The Colts organization released a statement Sunday, prompted by the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota last week and the wave of protests that erupted across the country, including in Indianapolis over the weekend. Frank Reich wanted to speak personally, to say something more. Reich addressed Floyd’s death in a team meeting Thursday, spent part of his weekend reaching out to Colts players to understand their pain, penned his own statement, and he opened his weekly media availability Monday by addressing the subject directly, becoming the second NFL head coach, after Dolphins' Brian Flores. “Injustice. Few things stir the human heart and soul like injustice,"" Reich wrote. ""When we see it, feel it, experience it, it’s heart-wrenching. It’s not enough for a person who looks like me to say ‘I’m not racist.’ This kind of talk and thinking typically lends itself to a posture of neutrality, indifference and passivity. It’s easy to be silent and do nothing when it doesn’t directly impact you. This attitude simply doesn’t invoke any conviction about doing what is right and standing up for the inherent dignity and rights of all people, no matter the color of their skin. I stand firmly behind the Colts statement and in particular, the phrase that says ‘We abhor racism.’ Racism is vile, deplorable, detestable. There’s no form of it that is acceptable, and in no way can it be justified. ""Our black community has bore the brunt of this injustice for far too long. I believe that I, we, all have a personal responsibility to speak up and act in ways that build each other up, not tear each other down. I believe each one of us can make a difference if we’re willing to grow personally and display the courage necessary for us to take steps of progress in this most important of issues.” Reich, the former pastor who has often opened his news conferences during the coronavirus pandemic with messages of encouragement and resilience, felt compelled to say something more. “Cannot be silent,” Reich said. “Want to be proactive, want to do my part, and feel responsible.” Reich watched the video of Floyd’s death last week, and immediately felt he had to say something in the team’s Zoom meeting Thursday — Colts players and coaches are still staying away from the team facility due to the coronavirus pandemic — even though Reich would rather have a painful conversation like this one in person. “I didn’t see it until, probably later than some, probably half a day later than I should have seen it,” Reich said. “Absolutely heart-wrenching. That’s what injustice does to us. I don’t understand it. I want to think that if I was there, I could help stop it. It’s wrong in every form, and in particular, it’s been aimed at the black community more than any other, and that makes me hurt.” Both the Colts coach and general manager Chris Ballard spoke to the team in the meeting, then opened the floor for a few players in a short meeting, limited by their physical separation and the impersonality of video conferencing. Reich’s role as head coach, typically, is to lead, to issue orders and directives for this players to follow. But he is not going to tell his players what to do in this situation. Peaceful protests have given way to violent demonstrations over the course of the last week, a week that has proven physically dangerous for protesters and police in cities across the country. In Indianapolis, 38-year-old Chris Beaty and 18-year-old Dorian Murrell were shot and killed in separate downtown incidents late Saturday and early Sunday. For some coaches and in some instances, the instinct would be to tell players to stay away in the name of safety. Reich did not issue any sort of edict to the Colts. A few Colts players took part in peaceful protests over the weekend, and a few others, like rookie cornerback Isaiah Rodgers, participated in city cleanups the morning after demonstrations destroyed property. “Sometimes it requires taking risks,” Reich said. “I trust our players. I wouldn’t be foolish enough to try to tell them how to display and act on how they feel inside.” Reich sees his team as a family. A family that doesn’t supersede its individual members. “I’m all about the players expressing their individual identities and personalities. I just happen to think that doesn’t have to conflict with what the team value and identity is,” Reich said. “It’s not surprising to me to see our players saying the right thing and doing the right thing. I’ve come to expect it, and trust it, and I personally believe in them. I can’t call every guy and say ‘hey, what are you going to do?’ In some regards, I think they should be calling me and helping me, telling me what to do and what to say.” Reich stressed repeatedly he understands the limitations of his position in this situation. As a white man, Reich knows, and said repeatedly in his news conference Monday, that he can never fully understand what his black players have gone through and what they’re feeling right now. For that reason, he’s more inclined to listen than to speak. “For me to have a growth mindset, for me to help understand the issue better, for me to know what to say and how to act, I just think it requires being uncomfortable, and making phone calls and asking people how they’re feeling,” Reich said. Reich hadn’t decided yet, as of Monday morning, if the team will talk about the ongoing protests, unrest and national pain when they meet on Zoom again on Tuesday for the start of the team’s virtual work week. But he has made it clear he’s not afraid to step into that space. “There’s just something innately that I think we all know inside when we saw what happened in Minnesota, when we see what happens in general in this issue, innately we all know something’s wrong, something must be said,” Reich said. “I just felt like we couldn’t be silent.”’ As a team. Or as an individual. More:Former IU football player Chris Beaty shot, killed amid Indianapolis violence More:Years later, groundswell of sports figures and institutions follow Kaepernick's lead",0.0

A sign held by Marissa Rayborn, one of the organizers for the protest, had names of individuals killed by police. The protesters mourned those people, including George Floyd, whose death in custody in Minneapolis started a chain of protests not only across America but also globally. ""It sickens me. Lord.

There was no police presence at the protest. Hansford said she's protesting because she doesn't want her three-year-old son growing up afraid of the police. She's concerned about the perceived aggressiveness and use of force by police against black people. ""It's scary, and we’re going to make a change. We’re making a move.

The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York has posted a longer version of a video clip that has gone viral on social media depicting scenes that unfolded over the weekend in Manhattan around the time of George Floyd demonstrations. “Now we have the full story: this police officer unholstered his weapon only after his supervisor was nearly killed with a brick. #FactsMatter,” the union – which represents 50,000 active and retired NYPD officers, wrote in a tweet. NYPD OFFICER STRUCK IN NEW YORK CITY IN APPARENT HIT-AND-RUN, VIDEO SHOWS The expanded footage shows an unidentified individual approaching an officer from his rear and then throwing an object at him. The targeted officer then flees the intersection before the cop that drew De Blasio’s scorn enters the same area and starts waving his gun around at demonstrators, who run away in response. An initial video of the incident – which has 2.5 million views – began with the cop drawing his firearm and did not show the moments beforehand in which the other officer was targeted by the mystery individual. Yet, hours before the expanded footage was posted online, De Blasio, during his daily press conference Monday, called for the cop to be fired. “That to me, seeing that video was absolutely unacceptable,” the mayor said. “Now, I don’t know all the circumstances and we must know all the facts. There will be an immediate full investigation of that incident.” DE BLASIO STANDS BY HIS DAUGHTER AFTER PROTEST ARREST, DISPUTES MEDIA REPORTS “We have to always know it is not the place of an officer to pull a gun in the middle of a crowd. Knowing that there are peaceful protesters in that crowd, that is unacceptable,” he continued. “That is dangerous. I want you to note on that video how a superior officer immediately came over and moved that officer away from that crowd. “That officer should have his gun and badge taken away today,” de Blasio concluded. It’s not clear if de Blasio was aware of the situation that unfolded before the officer drew his gun. It’s also not clear if the crowds at that scene were peacefully protesting the police-involved death of George Floyd, or if it was looters who have seemingly hijacked the protests to run riot over U.S. cities, including Manhattan, in recent days.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Several Democratic governors on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the U.S. military unless they dispatch National Guard units to “dominate the streets” in reaction to the violence that has erupted across the country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn’t believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump’s comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state’s National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,” Cuomo said on CNN about Trump’s call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn’t clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state’s response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state’s guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,” Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state’s National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” “As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump’s comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn’t immediately comment on Trump’s remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump’s morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.",0.0

But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation,” Biden will say in his speech Tuesday morning, according to excerpts of the address released by the candidate’s campaign. Biden, who held his first in-person campaign event in over two months Monday in Wilmington, Delaware, hearing from members of the African American community about their priorities in the wake of Floyd’s death, will also emphasize that the protests, coupled with the disproportionate impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on minority communities, highlight the need to address systemic racial injustices. “They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment – with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities,” Biden will say. The Democrat will also take direct aim at President Trump, following a night defined by the decision to use tear gas to push back peaceful protestors near the White House so that Trump could walk to the historic St. John’s Church nearby and pose with a Bible alongside senior members of administration. “When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden will say. “More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care,” Biden will add. “For that’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us.” Biden said that while no person can promise to be a perfect president, the former vice president pledged to try to unite the country and “heal the racial wounds.” “I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,” Biden will say. “I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me. It’s about you. And I’ll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was.” The focus on President Trump’s exploitation of division has long been a focus for Biden in his presidential campaign, launching his run with a video that focused on the events of Charlottesville in 2017 as the catalyst prompting his third run for the White House. “That’s when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world, and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were ‘very fine people on both sides.’ Very fine people on both sides?” Biden said in the April 2019 video launching his campaign. “With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had seen in my lifetime,” Biden continued. During a roundtable on Monday with mayors from major American cities, Biden described the widespread protests as a manifestation of “justifiable” anger, but urged those protestors to refrain from violence and looting, which he argues overshadows their main message. “We need that anger. We need that to tell us to move forward. It helps us push through this pain and reach the other side to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion,” Biden said. “But we’re also seeing a justifiable public outrage and protests turned to acts of needless destruction in cities across the country, which are not justified.” “I think we all agree that the act of protesting should never be overshadowed by the reason we’re protesting. It shouldn’t drive people away from a just cause that a protest is meant to advance, but violence is endangers lives, it guts local businesses, it is no way forward,” he added, speaking with the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul.

The Olympics and protests The Olympic Games themselves are no stranger to protests. One of the most famous examples was in the 1968 Olympics when black athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a fist on the podium after medaling in the 200 meter race while the Star Spangled Banner was being played. According to History.com, their raised black-gloved fists represented their “solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world.” They also stood in “black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty, [and wore] beads to protest lynchings.” The third man on the podium was Australian Peter Norman, who didn’t raise his fist but joined them in wearing a badge for the Olympic Project for Human rights All faced intense backlash. The Americans were suspended from the U.S. team and the Australian never competed in the Olympics again despite qualifying multiple times for the Australian Olympic team, History.com said.

The S&P 500 rose 0.2% in the first few minutes of trading Tuesday. The gains were led by stocks that would stand to gain the most from a growing economy, including banks and industrial companies. The price of crude oil rose again, which helped energy companies. Markets in Europe and Asia also rose. Bond yields rose slightly, another sign that pessimism was ebbing among investors. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: Global stock markets rose Tuesday as more economies reopened for business after long and painful shutdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic. While the social unrest in the U.S. continued to provide a gloomy backdrop, international investors remained focus on the prospects for global economic growth. More countries and sectors are reopening, though activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Futures for the Dow and the S&P 500 indexes on Wall Street were up 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% to 4,863 as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.9% to 12,033. Britain's FTSE 100 added 1% to 6,2130. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.2% to finish at 22,325.61, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.8% to 23,912.07. South Korea’s Kospi added 1.1% to 2,087.42. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose nearly 0.3% to 5,835.10, while the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1% to 2,918.94. In Southeast Asia, where shutdowns are beginning to ease, Indonesia's benchmark jumped nearly 2.0% and Singapore's surged 2.3%. Despite the bright mood across, fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Critics had said Japan's relaxation of its pandemic precautions was premature, and Japanese media reported that Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike plans to announce a “Tokyo Alert"" requesting residents of the capital to try harder at social distancing. Despite such concerns and the widespread unrest erupting in many U.S. cities, hopes for a quick recovery from the worst global downturn since the 1930s have spurred recent rallies. The protests that have rocked American cities for days have so far not had much impact on financial markets. But the violence and damage to property may hinder the re-opening of the economy. Crowds gathering to protest injustice and racism also could touch off more outbreaks. But Robert Carnell, regional head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at ING, warned against too much optimism. “How long can markets remain buoyant?” he asked. “The honest answer, and one that may save you five minutes is, ‘I don’t know.’ ” This week will provide market watchers more insight on the impact that the coronavirus is having on U.S. workers and employers. Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies on Wednesday. The next day, the government releases its weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid. On Friday, the government reports its May labor market data. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the report will show the economy lost 9 million jobs last month.

But then last year when we had similar riots in Hong Kong, what was their position?” The U.S., Britain and some other Western democracies sharply criticized police crackdowns on anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year. Lam pointed to more recent criticism of an imminent national security law that many foreign politicians have characterized as Beijing eroding freedoms promised to Hong Kong. “They take their own country’s national security very seriously, but for the security of our country, especially the situation in Hong Kong, they are looking at it through tinted glasses,” she said. Lam will lead a delegation of senior Hong Kong officials to Beijing on Wednesday to present her views on the planned national security laws to Chinese government officials, the Hong Kong government announced. China’s ceremonial legislature last week approved a decision to create national security laws for Hong Kong, aimed at curbing subversive and secessionist activity after the monthslong pro-democracy movement last year that at times resulted in violent clashes between protesters and police. In response to the proposed laws, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday pledged to “take action to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory.” Lam said if any countries imposed sanctions or made moves to affect trading relations, they would only be “hurting their own interests.” She went on to highlight the U.S. trade surplus with Hong Kong. “Foreign governments have been responding in a high-profile manner, some have threatened certain actions, and I can only say that they are adopting double standards,” Lam said. Lam also expressed concern over the latest coronavirus outbreak in the city, after a cluster of nine people in the same public housing building tested positive for the virus over the past few days, ending a streak of nearly two weeks without locally transmitted cases. Hong Kong on Tuesday said it would implement a two-week extension of social distancing measures, including a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people, to June 18. The city's entry restrictions will also remain in place until Sept. 18 for foreign non-residents, with the exception of those who have stayed in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for 14 days prior to their arrival in Hong Kong. Residents of those places are also allowed into the city if they have not traveled elsewhere prior to their arrival.",0.0

Marchers guzzled down water and cleared out in front of the banners leading the crowd so George Floyd’s name could be clearly seen. Cece Carlson, 28, of Bronzeville, said she came to the march to stand in solidarity and march with her sister. “First and foremost, I’m a black woman so that in itself, my identity, is what brought me out,” Carlson said. “This is my neighborhood.” Carlson said she’s tired of police brutality and those who get away with it “over and over again.” “And I’m here fighting for the lives whose names don’t get remembered, whose stories don’t get told,” Carlson said. “Like Breonna Taylor, and countless others.” Advertisement Carlson said she hopes people are “thinking about not just the actions they’re taking in the present but the actions they’re taking for the rest of their lives” to support black lives. “And I want to call action to white people,” Carlson said. “What are you white people going to do about it?” Xavier Vance, 29, of Englewood, said he came to the Bronzeville march for “justice for Floyd, justice for every person that was black, wrongfully killed and wrongfully convicted.” Vance said he has been marching “every day, all weekend.” “Sometimes I will just get out of my car and see a protest and join a march, just to support the cause and make sure my voice is heard,” Vance said. “I’m hoping people understand the pain that we go through, seeing our loved ones being murdered by the hands of people that are supposed to protect us,” Vance added. He hopes to keep attending events until there is justice for Floyd and his family, Vance said. “I have twin brothers that I’m concerned about growing up and being a man in this dangerous world that’s built to not protect them,” Vance said. “Mainly I’m just hoping that we can get through to those, get through to police officers, and that we can make some change by being out here during the pandemic. And that we can just make some change in the world in general. It’s not right that we have to do this during the pandemic. It’s not right seeing our people killed for decades.” —Morgan Greene 8:07 p.m.: ‘The side of Chicago that somebody needs to see’ Protesters, numbering in the thousands, paused every few blocks for short speeches on unity, police brutality and seeking justice for George Floyd from faith leaders including pastors, imams and rabbis. Residents along the drive looked out from windows and held up their phones to film. Signs with messages like “Time 4 Change” and “Jesus Loves Justice” went up as the sun started to set. Nakelia Franklin, 27, of Bronzeville, said she came to the march because, as a social worker, she wants justice for everyone. “I’m a young African American so this just hits home,” Franklin said. “If we don’t stand for it then no one else will. “I think people just need to realize that this is real,” Franklin added. “This is real life. This isn’t something that happens once a year. It happens every day.” Courtney Kimble, also a Bronzeville resident, set up a chair on the grass to support marchers as they headed south. She said anyone trying to justify the recent tragic events “just ripped my heart out of my chest.” “This is the least I can do,” Kimble said. “We couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful day. Every one of these people is beautiful. “This is the side of Chicago that somebody needs to see,” Kimble said. “I hear people chanting about Bronzeville strong and solidarity. This is awesome.” —Morgan Greene Advertisement 7:43 p.m.: Surprise demonstration in Elmhurst a peaceful affair Tuesday evening Roughly 200 demonstrators covered all four corners of North Avenue and North York Street in Elmhurst Tuesday afternoon as they chanted and waved placards demanding racial justice. It was a peaceful gathering, but one that caught the DuPage County city by surprise. Officials announced Monday that organizers had agreed to push back a march and vigil planned for Tuesday by one week “in hopes that the broader criminal behavior that we are alerted to has subsided.” But when they learned people were coming anyway, they sent another alert Tuesday afternoon saying the city had restricted vehicle access to the retail strip along York Street and asked businesses to close by 3 p.m. By 6 p.m., with the demonstration going strong, about half the businesses on York had boarded up their windows. Robert Fonzino, owner of the Bilancio salon and day spa, was still waiting for his carpenter to arrive, regretting that he had lost an afternoon of business on his first day open in 10 weeks. “I don’t know what the cause is,” he said. “I think the protesters are fine. I think their hearts are in the right place. I don’t think that’s the problem. I think it’s the thugs that follow. I don’t think they have any idea what they’re doing other than to be destructive.” But as the evening began, nothing belligerent was happening back at the intersection. Elmhurst resident Yeena Yoo, holding a sign that read “It is better to protest than to accept injustice,” brought her two young kids to the demonstration, saying she had no safety concerns and felt it was important to participate. “I am appalled by the racial injustices that are happening all over our country, so I’m here with my children because I feel it’s really important to have peaceful protest, just like Martin Luther King did,” she said. Police from Elmhurst and Bensenville hung back from the gathering, which garnered many honks of support from passing cars. “It’s peaceful; there’s no rioting or anything like that,” said Andre Sorrell, a Chicago native who has lived in Elmhurst for about a year and a half. “It’s been a long time coming … I have an interracial family so this movement means a lot to me. Anything that can make the future better for my kids, I’m all for it.” —John Keilman 7:06 p.m.: Lightfoot asks Chicago to ‘stand for peace’ and announces $10 million grant fund to help looted businesses In a televised speech aimed at calming a city rocked by widespread looting, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Tuesday evening announced a $10 million grant fund for looted businesses and promised to implement a series of long-stalled police reforms. Lightfoot also laid out a series of measures she has ordered new Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown to implement within 90 days as part of a broader effort at reforming the long-troubled department, some of which have been languishing for years. “If there is to be an uprising, let it be for peace. I call on all people of good will, young, old, black, brown, white, Asian, from all faith traditions, to rise up with me for peace,” Lightfoot said from her City Hall office. “Stand for peace.” The police reform measures Lightfoot wants to implement include teaching Chicago cops about ""the history of neighborhoods taught from the perspective of community members, inspired by youth-led neighborhood tours done by My Block, My Hood, My City. The city also will implement an officer wellness program and complete an officer support program that supports cops in crisis, mandate crisis intervention and procedural justice training for all officers, and establish a new recruit program on police-community relations and community policing with views from the community about what works, she said. Referring to damaged businesses around the city, Lightfoot said, “We will clean up these broken windows, but we can’t stop there. We must also clean up and repair our broken systems.” Lightfoot said the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd is linked to a history of racism in America and police misconduct exemplified by Laquan McDonald’s murder and infamous city cop Jon Burge. She said “four shameful Mineapolis police officers who took his life."" But Lightfoot took a strong stand against looting, saying the city can’t allow its pain to “spill over into violence and destruction against our communities."" “I will never stand for stealing the dreams and livelihoods of our neighbors. I will never stand for abandoning our values and our love of this city,” Lightfoot said. “My heart is broken over what has happened here in the city that I love.” —Gregory Pratt 6:44 p.m.: Marching for peace and justice in Bronzeville On a sweltering Tuesday evening, dozens of faith and community leaders gathered in Bronzeville to lead a peaceful march in memory of George Floyd. Shortly after 6 p.m., leaders of various faiths led the crowd in prayers. On the count of three, the marchers joined together in “Black Lives Matter” and started walking to music. The crowd pumped their fists as voices in the song cried, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” Those at the front of the march held banners saying “George Floyd” and “Black Lives Matter.” Organizers said they planned the march for South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive as a symbolic gesture, to represent its peaceful nature. Some nearby residents placed bottles of water on the sidewalk for those marching. Others held signs with messages like “Peace and Justice.” The crowd headed south toward East 51st Street and the protest was expected to end at Washington Park. —Morgan Greene 6:36 p.m.: McDonald’s, Walgreens and the Cubs among companies condemning racism in wake of George Floyd’s death While small businesses tend to broken store windows and damaged merchandise amid fallout from George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, brands such as Nike and Amazon are busy weighing in on systemic racism in America. McDonald’s, Walgreens and the Chicago Cubs are among the Chicago-area companies that have posted social media messages, sent letters to employees and held town halls in recent days denouncing discrimination, and pledging commitments to diversity and inclusiveness. “When any member of our McFamily hurts, we all hurt,” Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said in a public LinkedIn post Saturday. It is not clear if the messages will resonate with customers, employees and a nation reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and more than a week of widespread social unrest, but brands are nonetheless racing to position themselves as champions of social justice.

Testing sites in Harwood Heights, Aurora, Rockford, East St. Louis, Bloomington, South Holland, the Chatham community area, Champaign, Rolling Meadows and Peoria would reopen Wednesday. The Waukegan site will reopen Thursday in a new location to accommodate the return of vehicle emissions testing at the previous location. Advertisement Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday that some of the testing sites had to be shut down because local law enforcement weren’t able to provide protection for Illinois National Guard members staffing them during the unrest. “It’s one of the unfortunate consequences of what’s happened is we can’t have Guardsman out there unprotected providing the testing,” Pritzker said. —Dan Petrella 5:47 p.m.: National Guard set to deploy to suburbs Tuesday night More than 200 Illinois National Guard members are in final preparations for deploying to the Chicago suburbs Tuesday night, according to Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office. Their mission, in terms of location, will be flexible so troops can respond to situations as they evolve. The guard will only provide assistance when requested by local law enforcement, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said. The guard’s availability comes as local law-enforcement officials are monitoring potential unrest in Downers Grove, Elmhurst, Joliet and Oak Brook Tuesday night. The governor activated 250 additional guard members this week to help quell violence and vandalism in the metropolitan area. He also has deployed 375 soldiers and airmen to Chicago to assist with street closures. The soldiers and airmen have been given explicit orders not to interfere with protesters who are exercising their First Amendment rights, the governor said. In the suburbs, troops will be deployed to communities in platoons of 30 to 40 members. “We are doing — and will do — everything we can to protect private property,” Pritzker said Monday. “We’ll continue to deploy as needed.” A day before the activation, the Illinois National Guard provided aerial support during unrest in downtown Aurora Sunday night. In addition the guard units, the governor ordered the Illinois State Police to provide an additional 300 troopers to support local municipalities. He also issued emergency proclamations for nine counties in Illinois to expedite the use of state resources, personnel and equipment to restore order. —Stacy St. Clair 5:45 p.m.: Joliet mayor says he was acting in self-defense when he grabbed and shoved a protester in skirmish caught on video Joliet Mayor Bob O’Dekirk released a statement Tuesday saying he was acting in self-defense during a skirmish with a protester Sunday evening. A video of the scuffle, which emerged Tuesday, shows a chaotic scene of police dispersing a crowd of people Sunday evening who had gathered in protest of the alleged murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The video appears to show O’Dekirk grabbing a man by his collar and forcibly walking him toward a police car several yards away when a second person attacks the mayor from behind. O’Dekirk and the first man appear to fall to the ground and are quickly surrounded by several other officers. It’s unclear from the video what prompted O’Dekirk, a former Joliet police officer, to place his hands on the first man. O’Dekirk said he acted in self-defense after he was “confronted by a rioter and then attacked,” adding later the unidentified man tried to shove him.

On Tuesday, a local advocacy group for biking and transit launched a petition to bring back Divvy, as well as full CTA service. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said both the CTA and Divvy bikes have been used to commit crimes, and she could not turn a “blind eye” to the issue. The Active Transportation Alliance said in a blog entry that while it appreciated the position faced by Chicago leaders, “we need reliable transportation options more than ever.” Metra has been out of service since Monday morning, and both CTA and Pace suburban bus service shut down service on Sunday and Monday nights. CTA has limited service during the day to avoid wide areas of the city, including downtown. Pace also has not been coming into downtown Chicago, though it plans to resume normal service on Wednesday.

Lightfoot will speak at 6:30 p.m. from her ceremonial office, and “deliver a State of the City Address to Chicago’s residents from her ceremonial office to contextualize events that have happened in recent days,” her office said. You can watch Lightfoot’s address live here. The mayor has spent the past several days pleading for peace as protesters marched and traveling mobs of citizens pillaged stores in the neighborhoods. The city has blocked off downtown roads to keep non-residents or workers out – a decision that’s been criticized as prioritizing the Loop over neighborhoods, though Lightfoot defended the decision by saying it allowed officials to put police in neighborhoods. —Gregory Pratt 4:20 p.m.: Insurance should help businesses damaged during unrest, but merchants question whether it will be enough The looters who on Sunday ransacked Z Smoke Shop, which has been selling glass pipes and vaping products in Logan Square for eight years, left behind not only major damage but also empty shelves that could take weeks to fill. “We will be closed for a good while,” said manager Kyle Korab. “There isn’t one piece of glass that isn’t broke.” The business called its insurance company immediately. Now it’s waiting, nervously, to see if its claim is approved. “We’re not 100% sure,” Korab said. “They might find a reason to not cover it.” Read the story here. —Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz 4 p.m.: Protesters march from Wrigley Field to Old Town A large group of protesters moved south down Clark Street from Wrigley Field around 2 p.m., trailed by several cars and even a van toting water to keep marchers hydrated. Bryan Cho said he has been volunteering his car as a caravan and supply van for three days now. Advertisement “Water guys, take as many as you need,” he said. More than 20 cars appeared to be following along with the group, handing out water. At the corner of Clark and Drummond Place, Laura Janota took a break from watering her garden to pour water onto exhausted marchers. “I was watering my garden and I heard them coming, so I brought my watering can out to provide some relief,” she said. Crowds of predominantly young people streamed down sidewalks southbound on Clark clutching bottles of water and makeshift signs. Many chanted “Black Lives Matter” as police on bike guided the crowd. Part of the crowd stopped at Clark and Menomonee Street where a few hundred conducted a sit in. After marching to the north end of Old Town a little after 3 p.m., and making briefly for Lake Shore Drive, much of the group headed back north on Clark Street, although some split off and headed west. —Jessica Villagomez 3:22 p.m.: Grocery delivery could be tougher to come by as George Floyd fallout continues Delivery services like Amazon, Instacart and Shipt say they have scaled back services in cities including Chicago amid ongoing unrest and looting. Fallout from the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd sparked protests and civil unrest in cities across the country, including Chicago. A 9 p.m. curfew is in place in the city, where some damaged stores remain closed and others have reduced their hours. That could make grocery delivery tougher to come by at a time when consumers, concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, have been relying on the services to avoid unnecessary trips to the store. Shipt, which delivers products from stores including Target and CVS, has temporarily suspended service in the downtown Chicago area. Outside downtown and in the suburbs, it adjusted hours to comply with local curfews or earlier closing times at stores offering the service, the company said in an email. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, said it adjusted routes or scaled back delivery options to ensure workers’ safety in a handful of cities, including Chicago.

J.B. Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday turned to religious and community leaders to urge protesters to channel anger over the death of George Floyd toward efforts for criminal justice reform and economic development in minority communities. “What’s very important to me is that we establish an agenda — an agenda that’s led, in part, by the very peaceful protesters that are out on the streets, that were there protesting last night, the night before and the night before, the folks who there with legitimate grievance,” Pritzker said. Preckwinkle encouraged those angered by the “racist, preventable death” of Floyd, who was African American, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis to “seize this moment and try to bring freedom and justice to every American.” “We cannot do this by destroying our communities,” said Preckwinkle, a Hyde Park resident. “We cannot do this by decimating what makes our black and brown communities so strong, so close-knit, even in the face of decades, generations of racist government policies and disinvestment.” Read more here. —Dan Petrella 3:10 p.m.: Top cop says National Guard troops patrolling neighborhoods would be ‘wrought with failure’ Chicago police Superintendent David Brown on Tuesday explained his opposition to having National Guard troops patrol the city’s neighborhoods to quell protests, looting, and other unrest that has flared since the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. “Let’s revisit how we got here: We got here for an inappropriate use of force in Minneapolis,” Brown said at an unrelated news conference Tuesday. “We got here through police officers not following their training in positionally asphyxiating a person until they died — caught on tape, and we’ve seen it over and over again to all of our embarrassment. “And now you want to call in the National Guard who are not suited to use force in the ways all of our residents expect? All the hard work that our profession has ... trained ... I want to turn over to a National Guard that’s not trained, has no connection to our neighborhoods, have not been engaged, who have not built trust, to bring us back to the place we started?” Brown said. “We’re not considering that.” Brown also noted that National Guard troops don’t have the training in de-escalation as police officers do, and asking them to step in is “wrought with failure.” “What is the likely outcome when rocks are thrown at the National Guard? When shovels and other (objects), hammers, when shots are fired from a crowd at the National Guard?” said Brown. “Likely not the restraint, the patience that our officers have utilized. “They don’t have the training in any of those areas or the experience, and to ask them to come into our neighborhoods and be faced with those critical split-second decisions without the training is obviously asking for more of the same,” he continued. Brown also addressed the “looters’ tactics,” and their connection to protests and the challenges police face. “They peacefully protest and then they end the protest, while all at the same time factions of peaceful (protesters) are in the crowd ready to loot as soon as peaceful protests end ...,” Brown said. “And then our officers have to both navigate First Amendment-sacred rights, but at the same no tolerance for looting.” He also urged the public to help businesses board up their windows and rebuild the city. He said he needs the public’s help with pushing back against rumors on social media “that fuel some of the divisiveness” in the city. Such rumors about the civil unrest has caused anxiety among the public, he said. —Jeremy Gorner 2:19 p.m.: Tinley Park imposes curfew ahead of scheduled protest Mayor Jacob Vandenberg of suburban Tinley Park said a temporary curfew has been reinstated for Tuesday night, starting at 8 p.m. Tuesday and ending at 6 a.m. Wednesday. He cited a protest expected to take place this evening at the Oak Park Avenue Metra station. The village is requesting that businesses along Oak Park Avenue close at 3 p.m. Tuesday. “The Village is taking these measures to ensure the safety and security of residents and businesses. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding,” the mayor said in a released statement. —Chicago Tribune staff 2:15 p.m.: Lightfoot says she’ll see Trump in court if he tries to send in military: ‘This is a man who likes to bluster’ Mayor Lori Lightfoot dismissed President Donald Trump’s threat to send the military into city streets across the country to quell protests as “bluster,” but promised to fight such a move in court if tries it in Chicago. Advertisement “That’s not gonna happen,” Lightfoot said Tuesday. “I will see him in court.” Referring to a 2017 incident where Trump tweeted, “Send in the feds!” about city violence, Lightfoot said, ""Keep in mind, this is a man who likes to bluster. Let’s not overreact.” Late Monday, Trump held a Rose Garden news conference to threaten he would mobilize the U.S. military to end “riots and lawlessness” in states that have erupted since the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. It was unclear what form such an action might take. Trump then walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to St. John’s Church, where he held a Bible for a photo-op, after federal officers had used tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters to make way for the president. Gov. J.B. Pritzker appeared on CNN as the scene unfolded and condemned Trump’s actions. Lightfoot’s comments Tuesday marked the latest exchange between Chicago’s mayor and Trump. Lightfoot last week responded to Trump tweeting a message that included, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts” in reply to rioting in Minneapolis and elsewhere following Floyd’s death. Lightfoot said the president cannot be allowed to divide and destabilize the country.

Police have taped off the station. By a little before 2 p.m., a sizeable crowd had gathered in front of Wrigley. Many people were hauling packs of bottled water and first aid supplies as temperatures push 90 degrees. “This is not a riot!,” the crowd chanted. 2:03 p.m.: Naperville businesses, residents get down to the business of cleaning up after looting Naperville residents awoke to a shattered downtown Tuesday, as a previous night of unrest led to looting and vandalism in the city’s main shopping and eating district. And then they got to work. Sonya Mingo-Williams and her two children left their Naperville home with brooms and trash bags at 6 a.m., just as a citywide curfew lifted. They arrived to find hundreds of like-minded Naperville residents ready to clean shattered glass from the sidewalks and scrub vandalized buildings. People smashed stores windows along several blocks Monday, including the local library, Starbucks and Chico’s clothing store. In addition to being vandalized, the Pandora jewelry store was entirely ransacked. “This is our town, and we were so disappointed by what happened last night,” she said. “We wanted to come down and help as soon as we could.” Mingo-Williams watched the violence unfold via social media Monday and was disheartened by the crimes she saw. She had attended a peaceful protest earlier in Naperville earlier in the day with her two children and it troubled her to watch the positive messages sent during that nonviolent gathering overshadowed by the destruction. “As a black family, we have talked to our children and it’s hard to see what’s going on in this country,” she said. “We tell them that they can help bring about change. Our message is strong and our message is important. And in this moment, people have tried to exploit it.” An estimated 300 people marched through the downtown Monday night, as police officers in riot gear watched. At least one person reported being stabbed, but police had not yet determined whether he had been injured by broken glass or a knife. A police officer was injured by a fireworks, officials said. His condition was unknown. As he surveyed the damage Tuesday morning, Mayor Steve Chirico said police had photographed license plates of cars parked in public garages and lots to determine where the participants live. The analysis has not been completed, but he said early indications are between 80 to 90% did not live in Naperville. Chirico met with protestors earlier in the day, urging them to get involved in their communities by volunteering and supporting political candidates who believe in social justice. The nonviolent protest’s message is now obscured by the nighttime unrest, he said. “I think it is lost,” Chirico said as his voice choked with emotion. “And that’s unfortunate because people tried to do something good.” There were still signed of goodness in Naperville that morning, as estimated 700 people helped with clean up efforts. The group had most it cleaned up by 7:45 a.m., as local businesses showed the gratitude by plying the volunteers with free food and drinks. “I wasn’t here to help with the (peaceful) protests yesterday and I felt like I needed to help,” said Lisle resident Catt Eicher as she swept to up tiny shards of glass along Jackson Avenue. “It’s better than looking at Twitter and feel sad (or) angry.” The town’s response heartened Councilman Benny White, who marched in the nonviolent protest earlier Monday. “The great thing, for me, is seeing the resilience of our community,” said White, the city council’s only African-American member. ""People are down here lending a hand and making it happen. I’m extremely proud of our community.” —Stacy St. Clair 1:22 p.m.: Evanston police take 12 people into custody following Best Buy looting incidents Twelve people were taken into custody following two looting incidents at a Best Buy in Evanston, according to police. Evanston police responded to a report of looting at the Best Buy store on Howard Street Monday afternoon around 2:30 p.m., said Evanston police Commander Brian Henry. “We had people right around the corner,” Henry said, so police responded right away after receiving the call. Police took a total of five people into custody following that “organized” incident Monday. That follows a similar incident at the same store Sunday evening in which seven people were taken into custody, Henry said. None of the 12 people taken into custody over the two days were from Evanston, Henry said. Police said they do not believe the incidents were connected to what was a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon. Charges were pending as of Tuesday morning. —Genevieve Bookwalter 12:57 p.m.: Feds charge 2 more people in connection to weekend looting in Chicago Two more people face federal charges following looting in Chicago over the weekend. Brandon Pegues and Amber L. Peltzer, both 28 and from the south suburbs, were charged Monday with illegal possession of a firearm. This follows federal charges against Matthew Rupert, 28, of Galesburg, for allegedly driving to Chicago and Minnesota to loot and riot. Early Sunday, around 12:40 a.m., Chicago police officers responded to crowds near 801 South Financial Place, authorities said. The officers saw four men running south, some carrying hammers, according to court filings. Advertisement Pegues looked at the police, adjusted the right side of his waistband and fled south on South Financial Place, according to the complaint. As officers chased him, he fell and a loaded 9 mm pistol dropped on the ground. Pegues pushed it under a car, where police recovered it, the complaint said. Around the same time, officers approached Peltzer sitting in a car in front of a bar at 16th Street and Michigan Avenue after noticing the glass front door of the business was shattered, according to the complaint. An officer saw Peltzer reach toward the front seat and the officers saw a loaded handgun lying there, authorities said. Peltzer was convicted of aggravated robbery in Will County in 2014, according to the federal filings. He is from Lansing. Pegues has a 2010 felony conviction for residential burglary in Cook County. On those charges, he was sentenced to 30 months’ probation. He is from Riverdale. —Sophie Sherry 11:50 a.m.: 6 Atlanta officers charged after dramatic video of arrest of college student from Chicago Six Atlanta police officers have been charged after a dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people, including a college student from Chicago, from a car during protests over the death of George Floyd, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced the charges during a news conference. “I feel a little safer now that these monsters are off the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else,” said Messiah Young, who was dragged from the vehicle along with his girlfriend, Taniyah Pilgrim, while they were caught in traffic. Young, 22, of Chicago, is a senior at Morehouse, where he’s studying business management. Pilgrim, 20 — from San Antonio, Texas — is a psychology major at Spelman College.

Not willing to accept Monday night, Naperville volunteers showed up early Tuesday morning to clean up the damage done during hours of looting that occurred after peaceful protests occurred throughout the afternoon and evening.

Lightfoot previously said restaurants, hotels and many more businesses would get to start opening June 3 with reduced capacities and tight rules in place designed to stop COVID-19 cases from spiking. That timeline seemed imperiled in recent days as fallout from the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd led to nationwide protests and civil unrest, but Lightfoot said the city will move forward with its plan as scheduled. “I want to tell the city now after a lot of consultation and, yes, a lot of prayer, we will reopen tomorrow and take this important next step as planned,” Lightfoot said at a morning new conference. The decision to reopen took some by surprise. Over the weekend, Lightfoot suggested that protests could delay a reopening.

They wore face shields, many flipped up to reveal expressionless faces. The lights of idling police vehicles flickered at their backs. And right in front of them on Madison Street, the West Garfield Park neighborhood’s main business artery, liquor stores, wig shops and dollar stores were suffering sustained looting, as people packed shopping carts and shoved large plastic storage bins full of items down the street.

The protests continued a tradition of Chicago activists crowding streets to complain about bias in enforcement, a lack of accountability for officers and police killing black people. The motivating forces driving the protests also extend beyond policing to unemployment and an often-ineffective health care system at a moment when a coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately hurt minorities, said Aislinn Pulley, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter: Chicago.

The chaos finally prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to dispatch extra police officers to the area, the New York Post reported Tuesday. “Fordham is on fire,” Uptown Collective tweeted, showing a half dozen fires burning along a trash-strewn Fordham Road in the West Bronx. “This is an ominous sign familia,” the tweet said, the Post reported. “This is not good for communities of color. Protest is called for but destroying our own community is not. Stay safe.” The cop being beaten was caught on cellphone video and posted on Twitter by a NYPD police union. It shows the uniformed officer on the ground as a man attacks him. A second man then runs up and throws an object at the officer. That person runs away as a third man picks up the object and hurls it at the officer. The person who shot the video is heard cursing the police. The video shows the dazed officer getting to his feet with his gun drawn, holding it down at his side. “NYPD Cop attacked in the Bronx,” the Sergeants Benevolent Association tweeted. “I guess the critics will now say he overreacted. NYPD Cops defend yourselves, you are alone!” Other video shows dozens of looters racing from a jewelry store as cops pull up close to the fires, according to the Post. NYPD OFFICER STRUCK BY VEHICLE IN THE BRONX IN APPARENT HIT-AND-RUN, VIDEO SHOWS “How are we destroying our own communities and are ok with it?” Jose Daniel Rojas asked in a tweet with video of the destruction, according to the paper. “There are serious problems we need to address.” The mayor tweeted early Tuesday that he had “just left the Bronx.” “Real problems on Fordham Road, also Burnside Avenue,” his tweet said. “Spoke with Councilman Fernando Cabrera about immediate steps to address the situation. MACY’S HERALD SQUARE LOOTED AS CURFEW FAILS TO STOP PROTESTERS FROM DAMAGING STORE “Also spoke to Commissioner Shea + Chief Pichardo, who are sending additional help,” de Blasio said. The looting happened amid protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody May 25 after Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pinned him down and kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes – an incident caught on cellphone video. Chauvin has since been charged in Floyd’s death. Three other officers at the scene have not. Cabrera called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo to activate the National Guard, as in other states, WNBC-TV reported Tuesday. “Fordham Road is the lifeblood of the West Bronx, providing jobs as well as essential goods and services,” Cabrera said, according to the station. “We are already suffering physically, socially and emotionally from the COVID-19 pandemic.

By Hollie Silverman, CNN (CNN) -- Americans have been protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police for days on end in dozens of cities throughout the United States. While tensions between police and demonstrators have heated up in many places, some officers have shown solidarity with the movement by hugging protesters, praying with them, mourning with them, and taking a knee to honor Floyd. In Atlanta, Georgia, a line of police officers holding shields during a protest Monday near Centennial Olympic park kneeled in front of demonstrators. In another image, an officer wearing a gas mask, helmet and vest was seen embracing a demonstrator in a hug on the fourth day of protests in the southern city. The Denver Chief of Police Paul Pazen joined in with demonstrators Monday, linking arms with attendees. On Sunday, Pazen said dozens of his officers had been injured while responding to the protests but were eager to return and protect the rights of demonstrators. In New York, Chief of Department of the New York City Police, Terence Monahan, embraced a demonstrator during a protest in his city Monday. On the west coast, protestor Kevin Welbeck of Cre8 The Change shook hands with a California Highway Patrol officer during a protest in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles.

Instead of a mask or protective gear, the 17-year-old wore his cap and gown -- which he hasn't gotten to wear because the Covid-19 pandemic delayed in-person graduations across the US. Joseph said he decided to wear his commencement garb on Thursday night because he wanted to do something ""to put positivity in the world."" ""People look at my people like we're down, like we don't have anything,"" he told CNN. ""I just don't think we're respected enough."" Joseph said that he wanted to show that people like him are reaching their goals. At first, he and his friends were just taking pictures around the neighborhood, but they saw the smoke from the nearby protest and decided to join in. ""I think a lot of people, including myself, were in disbelief and in awe,"" photographer Nathan Aguirre told CNN. ""The protests had died down slightly by this point. There were still large fires burning."" Aguirre took a picture of Joseph that's been shared widely on social media, but didn't get his name in all the commotion. Later, he found out that his nephew went to school with Joseph. Brit Lee, the sister of one of Joseph's friends, was also taking pictures and said police officers and protesters were congratulating him. Joseph had to finish his schoolwork online after Minnesota closed schools in March because of the pandemic. He's planning to go to art school and wants to get a degree in animation.

However, Cincinnati authorities said Monday night's activity marked some progress from weekend nights, when hundreds of people were arrested. Cincinnati police said 40 to 50 people were arrested, many for violating an 8 p.m. curfew. Police said several weapons were seized, including one with a 100-round magazine. Mayor John Cranley apologized for the police detention Monday night of a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter, calling it “a big mistake.” He was released without charges. At least one other reporter was pushed by police Monday night. Cincinnati police “apologized for any inconvenience” on its Twitter account, saying officers were trying to clear a street while withstanding rocks thrown at them. Police in Columbus and Cleveland also enforced curfews Monday night. More than 200 people were arrested over the weekend during protests sparked by the May 25 death of Floyd in Minnesota. Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed, died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had called out the Guard and highway patrol Saturday to help enforce laws in Cleveland and Columbus, where the mayors said more than 100 properties were damaged. Across the state, the damage was still being tallied from the unrest that also swept up Toledo, Akron and Dayton over the weekend. City officials in Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati over the weekend said they believed that out-of-towners were largely responsible for the violent protests that erupted in their cities. But since then, media outlets reviewed court records and reported that the large majority of those arrested during the protests were local or Ohio residents. Nearly all of the 99 people arrested Saturday in downtown Cleveland were from the city or its surrounding suburbs, cleveland.com reported. Toledo’s police chief and mayor said on Monday that all but one of the 22 people arrested Saturday were from the city but they maintained that there were outside “professional agitators” who contributed to the trouble. ------ Associated Press writer John Seewer in Toledo contributed.",0.0

For the third day, protesters gathered Monday near the Vigo County Courthouse, with some entering the street and creating traffic hazards, the Tribune-Star reported. Each person arrested late Monday and early Tuesday was released from jail on their own recognizance with instructions to appear in court on Wednesday for the misdemeanor charges. In Indianapolis, a crowd of protesters moved Monday evening from downtown to the Indiana governor’s residence on the north side, where they were met by police and ordered to disperse. At one point, officers agreed to walk with protesters back toward downtown. In the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel, approximately 300 protesters marched peacefully around the Arts and Design District and the Monon Trail for three hours until 8 p.m. Monday, city officials said. In Crown Point in northwest Indiana, a Black Lives Matter protest brought more than 30 men and women to the downtown square shouting “no justice, no peace,” and “George Floyd.” They held “I can’t breathe” signs and lay down on the sidewalk outside the old Lake County Courthouse.

Balin Brake, 21, said that as officers ordered the crowd in Fort Wayne to break up, he began running away and a tear gas canister struck his shoe, local station FOX 55 reported. SEATTLE COP REMOVES KNEE OF FELLOW OFFICER FROM NECK OF MAN DETAINED AMID LOOTING, VIDEO SHOWS Brake, who works part-time at the news station, said when he turned around to see what happened, a second canister struck him in the face. The station said Brake was not working for them at the time of the incident. A photo of Brake with a bloodied face was posted online. “He saw [the canister] hit the ground after it hit him,” Brake’s mother, Rachel Simonis, told The Journal Gazette. She said that doctors found “nothing left but the shell of his eye."" Brake posted a photo of his face after undergoing an operation on his eye. “I might have to have surgery for broken bones in my face within weeks to come but for now all that happened is I did end up losing my eye,” he wrote. “This pales in comparison to the hardships aftican (sic) americans have endured for decades.

There was no deliberate deployment of gas to any persons head.” Brake disputed the police statement, telling the paper that he “absolutely” did not try to bend over and pick up the can because they’re “hot as hell,” and he wasn’t wearing gloves.

Although many became violent in cities like Minneapolis, Chicago and even Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, the protests held in Michiana remained peaceful. The protests across the country this past weekend were held to not only speak out against the officer-involved killing of an unarmed black man named George Floyd in Minneapolis but also bring back the spotlight on police brutality and accountability. “It’s finally hitting home for people. We can’t take this anymore and it’s great that so many people showed up to the protest. So many people using their righteous rage to actually try to make some substantive change and that has been a long time coming,” Emmanuel Cannady, a Black Lives Matter activist said. While some Indiana cities like Fort Wayne and Indianapolis had protests turn into riots, here in Michiana, the demonstrations remained peaceful. “The folks that organized it wanted it peaceful so that’s what it was,” Cannady said. “Everyone has the right to protest, obviously, this tragic killing and our fop would like to thank our community for showing leadership through peaceful protest,” Harvey Mills the President of the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police. “We’re hoping that the south bend community will continue to be an example for the state and the country.” Even some local police officials in Michigan City taking in questions and talking with protestors. Now the topic of looting and rioting is highly debated across social media with some saying the riots are valid. “Personally, I think it’s justified anger at this point. When people have nothing else left, that’s what they’re going to resort to. It’s not an act of violence against their own neighborhood so to speak, it’s an act of violence against the system that has been violent to the people systemically,” Cannady said. While others say violence is never a means to an end. “Certainly we support protests however we do not support behavior that we’ve seen in other cities,” Michael Patton the President of the local NAACP chapter said. “Certainly George Floyd would be dishonored by doing that. We believe in peaceful marches protests and our city was a model for that.” Some say the reason why protests were peaceful over the weekend is because of how the police handled the situation. “One of our Black Lives Matter South Bend members was in Indianapolis. She said that the protests were actually incredibly peaceful when she first got there but it was actually when the police started tear-gassing that it became. The people fought back that’s when you saw the violence,” Cannady said. “Our police department was ready in case any lawlessness did occur. I think for the most part our officers tried to stay back and let those people protest that wanted to protest,” Mills said. The Black Live Matter Movement is having a national call to action week in response to the killing. So the local South Bend chapter is holding events this week to continue the conversation. Although BLM members locally say the protests will likely die down in the coming weeks. there is a scheduled youth-run protest that is going to be held here at the Morris Performing Arts Center on Friday. Other events include a Chalk the Sidewalk for Black Lives event outside of the county city building on Wednesday. It is being held to “discuss officer-involved murders of black men and women.” It's not only to address South Bend’s own officer-involved shooting of Eric Logan last June but for other names out there like George Floyd. There will also be several zoom seminars this week held by BLM. “The conversation for a lot of folks has never stopped. And I think for a lot of new folks that are just coming into the conversation. And we need to continue this but we need to do more than just talk. We need to act. We need to vote. We need to show up at council meetings,” Cannady said.",0.0

Advertisement — Prominent black Democrats warn that Joe Biden needs to address the concerns of nonwhite voters proactively to win their support in November, as the country is gripped by days of unrest. — The NRSC is launching its first round of TV ads of the cycle, an earlier-than-usual campaign as Republicans have been getting swamped on the airwaves.

Days until the D.C., Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and South Dakota primaries: 1 Days until the Democratic convention: 77 Days until the Republican convention: 84 Days until the 2020 election: 155 TopLine ALMOST THERE — Our whistlestop tour of Tuesday’s primaries lands us in Indiana, where there are two primaries to watch: The Democratic primary in the blue, open IN-01, and the Republican primary in the possible battleground IN-05. The race in IN-01 attracted over a dozen Democratic candidates to replace the retiring Rep. Pete Visclosky, but five have pulled in any significant amount of money: Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott, attorney Sabrina Haake, state Rep. Mara Candelaria Reardon, North Township Trustee Frank Mrvan and 2018 state Secretary of State candidate Jim Harper. Visclosky backed Mrvan in this suburban Chicago and Gary-area seat. But a lot of money has quietly flowed into the district, and McDermott has pretty significantly outraised everyone else. A super PAC called Democratic Progress has dropped over $500,000 backing McDermott. It was created earlier this year and appears to be entirely funded by Unite America, a Colorado-based super PAC that was founded by Charles Wheelan and counts Kathryn Murdoch and former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) among its board members. With Honor, which supports veterans of both parties running for office, also backs McDermott. The Voter Protection Project, a super PAC launched by former California candidate Andrew Janz, has thrown in for Reardon, as has the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A few smaller super PACs have recently backed Mrvan. In the northern Indianapolis-based IN-05, Democrats have rallied around former state Rep. Christina Hale, who is expected to cruise through her primary. That’s not the case on the Republican side, which has seen a pileup of candidates vying to win the nomination after GOP Rep. Susan Brooks announced she wouldn’t seek reelection. In a mid-May poll from the Club for Growth PAC, three candidates broken double-digits: state Sen. Victoria Spartz (whom the Club backs), former Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi (who the Indianapolis Star noted had a number of legal battles and was also temporarily suspended from practicing law) and businesswoman Beth Henderson. The Club has swarmed the airwaves in the district with ads boosting Spartz and knocking the other two candidates as being insufficiently supportive of President Donald Trump. All told, they’ve spent over $500,000 on the district, and Spartz has significantly self-funded her campaign. Another endorsement of note in the district: Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) has backed Henderson. Brooks, the NRCC’s recruiting chair, has not backed a successor. Presidential Big Board NOT ENOUGH — Black leaders warn that Democrats actually need to understand why people are angry, and cannot just say voting is a solution. “You cannot motivate someone to a behavior that they don’t believe will actually bring change,” Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams told The New York Times’ Astead Herndon. “We have to start by saying what you feel and what you fear is real.” A similar message from the Rev. Jesse Jackson: “The absence of Trump is not enough.” VEEPSTAKES — From the pandemic to the national outcry and unrest after a police officer killed a man in Minnesota, recent events are dramatically shaping Biden’s vice presidential pick. “The vice-presidential vetting process, typically a closely-guarded internal affair, is playing out in plain sight, often live and online as Biden remains sheltered at home during a pandemic that's stalled in-person campaigning,” POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago and David Siders wrote. (Siders also looks at the political ramifications on Minnesota.) — The law enforcement records of three candidates — Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) — are being scrutinized after the protests across the country, POLITICO’s Marc Caputo and Natasha Korecki wrote. “It’s Klobuchar’s vice presidential fortunes that may end up as the first political casualty of the Minneapolis unrest,” they wrote. “Demings and Harris, who are both black, have better records when it comes to social justice, according to some progressive activists and Democratic insiders who argue that black women have a better understanding of the scourge of police brutality. Their law enforcement credentials, some of those Democrats contend, must be viewed in the historic context in which they served as leaders.” — Karine Jean-Pierre, a newly-hired adviser to the Biden campaign, talked about the importance of having a representative ticket in an interview with the Grio’s Jason Johnson. “I think it’s important to have that representation on the ticket. Who is the best person that’s going to get you to 270? What does that ticket bring you? It’s a ticket that has to give you momentum. Has to give the entire campaign excitement,” she said. CONVENTION SPOTTING — There’s a back-and-forth between Republicans and North Carolina over the convention, which is still scheduled to be held in Charlotte. “In a letter to Republicans leaders on Friday, North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen asked for more information on how the GOP would carry out the late-August event in keeping with guidelines for public gatherings issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” POLITICO’s Maya King wrote. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in an interview on former Gov. Pat McCrory’s radio show that she thinks “there is a little bit of gamesmanship going on at this point. I didn't earlier but now I do,"" before the letter from Cohen was received. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s office also said Trump spoke to Cooper about the convention on Friday. “When the president insisted on a full convention arena with no face coverings and no social distancing, the governor expressed concerns and suggested a scaled-back event with fewer attendees,"" Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the governor, said in a statement, per CNN’s Kate Sullivan and Ryan Nobles. THE CASH DASH — Trump is set to soon resume in-person fundraising events. POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reported that Trump is set “to host a June 11 fundraiser at a private home in Dallas and a June 13 outdoor event at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club,” with the fundraisers being “smaller than Trump’s usual events.” POLLS POLLS POLLS — A new national poll has Biden with a wide lead over Trump. The ABC News/Washington Post poll, taken before much of the unrest that has gripped the country, has Biden leading Trump, 53 percent to 43 percent, among registered voters (835 registered voters; May 25-28; +/- 4 percentage point MOE). Down the Ballot THE SENATE MAP — The NRSC is hitting the airwaves. The party committee “is launching its first round of TV ads in three races this week and will be on air in six battleground states by early July,” Campaign Pro’s James Arkin reported (for Pros). “The long-planned effort represents an earlier-than-usual investment for the GOP’s official campaign arm, but Republicans acknowledge that it is coming after a prolonged period of essentially unanswered Democratic attacks. Democratic campaigns and outside groups have outspent Republicans on the airwaves in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina — in some cases by a more than two-to-one margin, according to data from Advertising Analytics.” Ads are rolling in Arizona and Michigan (one of the only races Republicans can play offense in) today and in Maine on Wednesday. THE HOUSE MAP — The race to pick the Republican opponent to face freshman Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in NJ-03 is presenting voters with a stark choice. POLITICO New Jersey’s Matt Friedman writes about the choice between “Kate Gibbs, a 34-year-old former elected official who as a suburban millennial woman comes from a crucial demographic that in 2018 abandoned the GOP, or David Richter, a wealthy 53-year-old former construction executive who spent decades living far from the district but whose campaign is getting help from one of Trump’s top advisers.” — The National Rifle Association’s political arm endorsed “little-known” GOP candidate Joe Caldarera in NY-11, spurning Trump-endorsed state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis in the race to face freshman Democratic Rep. Max Rose, the New York Post’s Carl Campanile reported. DIDN’T HAPPEN — In the days before the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, accused Democrats in the state of attempting to hack voter registration systems and opened an investigation. “But newly released case files from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation reveal that there was no such hacking attempt,” the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Mark Niesse and ProPublica’s Jack Gillum reported. “The evidence from the closed investigation indicates that Kemp’s office mistook planned security tests and a warning about potential election security holes for malicious hacking.” ON THE AIRWAVES — Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper released his first TV ad of the cycle, ahead of the June 30 Democratic Senate primary. In the direct-to-camera ad, Hickenlooper talks about the economy while he was governor. — End Citizens United, the Democratic outside group, is launching its first TV ad of the cycle. The ad, part of a $2 million campaign, criticizes Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). FIRST IN SCORE — ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF — Democratic state Sen. Joyce Elliott, who is running in AR-02 and was recently added to the DCCC’s Red-to-Blue program, is out with her first campaign ad, a digital biographical spot that talks about integrating schools and her career in the state legislature. “America is a big promise, and promises don’t come true without people doing something to make them come true,” she says in the video, referencing being inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. THE CASH DASH — Democrat Jon Ossoff loaned his campaign $450,000 Sunday in the final stretch ahead of the June 9 Georgia Senate primary, according to a new FEC filing. James writes in. Ossoff is considered the frontrunner and has outraised his opponents, Sarah Riggs Amico and Teresa Tomlinson, both of whom have also loaned money to their campaigns. But the race to face Republican Sen. David Perdue goes to an August runoff unless one of the candidates can top 50 percent in the primary. SAFE SEAT SCRAMBLE — Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) endorsed Teresa Leger Fernandez in the NM-03 primary. (Here’s my preview of the race from last week.) MEA CULPA — I did a dumb in Friday’s edition of Score: I wrote that Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham had $2.6 million in debt as of his pre-primary report, but I meant to write he had $2.6 million in cash on hand. (He has no debt.) My apologies! CODA — QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I don’t know who they’re talking to — nobody polled me, nobody polled members of my family,” interim Baltimore Mayor Jack Young on polling showing him trailing ahead of Tuesday’s primary in the city, to The Washington Post.

This order must include specific repercussions officers will face for violating this ban. If there is no action by the governor, we urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish a local policy that outlaws the use of a chokehold restraint, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. Additionally, we urge these entities to immediately implement the use of body cameras for all patrol officers and require them to be on at all times. If not, a penalty should be assessed. We urge the governor to immediately establish a Statewide Criminal Justice Commission, including a diverse appointing of civilian representatives from the cities with significant African American populations, to examine every aspect of our state’s criminal justice system and recommend comprehensive criminal justice reform, including the eradication of racist policing policies. We expect these recommendations to become bills that get passed in the 2021 Legislative Session. We urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish local Independent Civilian Review Boards, with members selected by local community activist groups, to review public complaints of police violence. 1:00 p.m. - Mayor Joe Hogsett and IMPD Chief Randal Taylor are providing a public safety update.

And to those who have chosen the path of nonviolent protest—we see you, we hear you, and we will work with you over the coming days, weeks, and months.

The damage was received to some of our state’s war memorials and monuments. Veterans, especially combat veterans, understand and appall violence as American service members have fought for years to bring down tyranny and maintain our freedoms. American Legion Department of Indiana says we are united as Americans, and will get through this together. But peace must prevail. As many have said, fire met with more fire, only burns everything to the ground. The American Legion Department of Indiana supports America’s right to peaceful protests, however, denounce the violence and rioting that is damaging communities and bringing more death. Officials pray for the safety of police officers and the National Guard who are protecting communities and pray that those who are peacefully protesting may be heard and not overshadowed by the violence so that meaningful change for all people who call Indiana their home, may occur. The American Legion is comprised of more than 77,000 military service veterans who have served honorably during times of conflict in defense of their nation and have been active within Indiana since 1919.

Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced the charges during a news conference. The Saturday night incident first gained attention from video online and on local news. Five of the officers are charged with aggravated assault, in addition to other charges. Two of the officers, Investigator Ivory Streeter and Investigator Mark Gardner, were fired earlier this week. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she’s ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn’t specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Dramatic body camera video that police released Sunday night shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street alongside a line of stopped cars. The man is pleading with police to let him go, saying he didn’t do anything. Young, sitting in the driver’s seat of a car stopped in the street holds up his phone, appearing to shoot video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver’s side door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He urges the officers to release the other man and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of the car shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her from the vehicle. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young’s hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered.",0.0

According to the news station, the owner of Firing Line Inc. told police that someone tried to break in over the weekend, so he decided to spend the night at the store. He was watching surveillance video around 4 a.m. Tuesday when he saw three or four people use bolt cutters to enter through the back door. When the group got to the second floor, the owner opened fire and hit one of the men in the head, police said. The man died at the scene. “One of the males pointed a gun at the owner, and that’s when the owner of the gun shop, who was in possession of one of his guns, fired several shots, striking the one male at least one time in the head,” said Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small. Police recovered a semi-automatic handgun near the man, reported KYW. The others fled the store. Investigators said one person who may be connected to the incident showed up at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the shoulder. Investigators are working to determine if he was involved in the burglary. Nothing was taken, and the 67-year-old store owner was not injured, said police.

Police were notified of a video on Facebook in which several people were talking about rioting at Walmart at 5 p.m., according to an affidavit from the Evansville Police Department. Ketia Lapointe (Photo: Provided / Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office) The video was deleted, along with the profile that posted it, but detectives decided to surveil the area. During that time, they were notified of a public Facebook Live video on a profile belonging to 20-year-old Ketia Lapointe of Orlando, Florida. Facebook Live allows users to post videos on the platform in real time. A man in the video, identified as 20-year-old Dave Casimir of Evansville, was allegedly pleading for people to meet him at the door of the store. ""I see about three crackers already,"" Casimir reportedly said when he saw police as the vehicle he was in pulled into the store parking lot. ""Somebody told on me."" Dave Casimir (Photo: Provided / Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office) He then discussed potentially moving to the West Side Walmart to evade police, but Casimir and Lapointe, joined by 20-year-old Redhler Joseph of Evansville, ended up walking into the store's east entrance shortly after they arrived. More: Evansville faith leaders mourn COVID-19 losses, call for end to institutional racism More: Here's where to vote in Tuesday's Indiana primary election Police said Casimir appeared annoyed that no one else showed up. ""The whole city is straight p*ssy,"" he reportedly said. The group returned to the vehicle when police said an unknown person joined into the live video. That person was at the store so the three went back inside. Redhler Joseph (Photo: Provided / Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office) ""At that point, it became clear that the group had taken significant steps to riot inside the store,"" arrest records state. ""These steps include discussing, recruiting, traveling to the location, and attempting to meet with others to carry out this crime."" Dispatchers received a 911 as detectives entered the store that looters had arrived. The three were booked into Vanderburgh County's jail on preliminary charges of attempted rioting and disorderly conduct. Lapointe faces an additional charge of resisting law enforcement. Casimir and Lapointe were released after posting bonds of $150 and $300 respectively, jail records show. Joseph remained in jail as of Tuesday morning in lieu of a $150 bond. The arrests come as several major cities across the countries have seen riots and protests sparked by the killing of an unarmed black man named George Floyd by a Minneapolis Police officer. A couple protests have taken place in the Evansville area, but all have been overwhelmingly peaceful.

Murder and manslaughter charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the Tuesday. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern: 1 p.m.: Surveillance video released from fatal police shooting in Louisville Authorities on Tuesday released surveillance video from an incident which caused the death of David McAtee, a black man shot by officers in Louisville, Kentucky, during protests. McAtee owned a local BBQ restaurant which was frequented by police officers, Mayor Greg Fischer said. At about 12:15 a.m. Monday, members of the Louisville police and Kentucky National Guard were trying to disperse a crowd when they “were fired upon,” Gov. Andy Beshear said. The local police and National Guard returned fire, “resulting in a death,” Beshear said. Video footage from McAtee’s restaurant and a neighboring business appeared to show officers approaching McAtee’s business, police said Tuesday. McAtee then appeared to fire a gun outside his restaurant, toward the officers, police said. Officers took cover and returned fire, police said. From the footage it appears McAtee fired first, police said. Authorities cautioned Tuesday that the video does not provide all of the answers. Why officers were approaching McAtee’s restaurant in the first place is under investigation, police said. The officers have not yet been interviewed, police said. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has since been fired after it was announced that no body camera footage was available of the shooting, The Louisville Courier Journal reported. Conrad previously said he would retire at the end of June after facing immense pressure following the March death of Breonna Taylor, a young black woman who was shot dead by police while in her home. The Kentucky State Police will independently investigate McAtee’s death, the governor said Monday. 12:15 p.m.: Despite overnight looting, Chicago to move into next phase of reopening Amid overnight looting, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot promised Tuesday, “we are 110% dedicated to you successfully reopening safely and securely.” Lightfoot said she was with one business owner who “burst into tears” and “broke down” as she looked at the devastation to her store. Despite the unrest, Lightfoot said Chicago will move into phase 3 of its coronavirus reopening on Wednesday. “We want economic activity to resume peacefully and safely in every single neighborhood, especially those hurting the most,” Lightfoot said. 11:12 a.m.: Nearly 700 arrested in NYC, curfew extended through the week In New York City, despite an 11 p.m. curfew, nearly 700 people were arrested overnight as peaceful protests devolved into moments of vandalism, looting, fire and confrontation. Luxury brands and big box retail stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side had windows smashed and spray painted. Many retailers have boarded up their storefronts. Some officers were hit by cars of protesters fleeing the scenes of vandalism and looting. It also appeared officers were shot at, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, condemning it as “unacceptable.” “I know people want peace,” de Blasio stressed Tuesday, “and I know the want change.” “I know we will overcome this,” he said, adding he’s asked community leaders to “step forward” and “take charge.” “Do not let outsiders attack your community …do not let criminals attack your community,” the mayor said. “I’ll be standing by you.” New York City will now be under a nine-hour curfew each night this week, beginning at 8 p.m. and ending at 5 a.m. The mayor on Tuesday asked those who want to protest to do so during the day, and then return home. He also said he’s very worried that protests are leading to the spread of the coronavirus. 10:40 a.m.: Senate Judiciary to hold hearing on George Floyd’s death, policing in US Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said he’s planning to hold a hearing on June 16 to examine Floyd’s death and policing in the country, promising to “take a deep dive” into the issue. “It’s a long-overdue wake-up call to the country that there are too many of these cases where African American men die in police custody under fairly brutal circumstances,” he said. “It’s clear to me that policing among men in the African American community is a topic that needs to be discussed and acted upon, and I expect this committee to do its part.” “I’d like to get to the root cause of it. Mr. Floyd’s case is outrageous on its face, but I think it speaks to a broader issue,” said Graham, R-S.C. “We just need to get to the bottom of what happened and what we can do to fix it.” Graham called community policing “the anecdote.” “I don’t know how to make that a reality, but we’ll have a hearing along those lines,” Graham said. 9 a.m.: More than 500 arrested overnight in NYC In New York City, despite an 11 p.m. curfew, more than 500 people were arrested overnight as peaceful protests devolved into moments of vandalism, looting, fire and confrontation. Luxury brands and big box retail stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side had windows smashed and spray painted. Many retailers have boarded up their storefronts. Several officers were hit by cars of protesters fleeing the scenes of vandalism and looting. 7:35 a.m.: Minnesota Attorney General says he is considering all charges for Derek Chauvin, including first degree murder Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison confirmed he is “considering all charges” and that “all options are on the table,” when it comes to prosecuting Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd. Speaking to ABC News’ Good Morning America, Ellison, who has taken over the prosecution in Floyd’s death, warned that the case must be dealt with methodically and that prosecuting Chauvin would not necessarily be easy. “Generally, jurors resolve all doubts in favor of the police,” said Ellison. “The system is such that there are certain immunities police have, there are certain presumptions. There are relationships that police have that are established over the course of years. And the fact is if you just look at the Freddie Gray case, people looked at that video and were quite certain that there needed to be a conviction. No one was.” “The fact is these cases are not easy,” said Ellison. “And anybody who says they are has never done one.” Ellison was reluctant to give a firm deadline on the timeline of the case but confirmed that the public could see charges very soon. “We are having a fresh review from what the county attorney has already done … and we are looking at this case with fresh eyes,” said Ellison. “There is nobody who has culpability who will not be held accountable.” Said Ellison: “The public has an expectation that there will be, there will render assistance when necessary, that [police] will not add harm. Just saying ‘I didn’t know’ and ‘I was following orders’, I don’t think is working for the public anymore. That is not a comment about the evidence or the law. It is a comment about where the public’s mind is these days.” Ellison said that he and his team are moving “expeditiously” but warned that they also have to move carefully which could take more time than the public would like. “There are numerous videos, numerous witness statements, a lot of stuff to go through for us to do due diligence,” Ellison stated. “We are not going to prolong this any longer than is absolutely necessary to do that due diligence and we are moving expeditiously, yet we have to move carefully. I know that is unsatisfying to people. They want, what they want immediately, and of course people have waited too long and have been too patient over the years but this case must be done methodically and we are doing that right now.” 6:49 a.m.: Las Vegas police officer in critical condition and on life support Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo held a brief press conference to update the public on the two shooting incidents that took place amid protests happening across the city last night. In the first incident, an officer was engaging with protesters near the Circus Circus hotel and casino and was shot. “Our officers were attempting to take rocks and bottles from the crowd,” said Lombardo during the press conference. “Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down.” The suspect in that shooting has been taken into custody but Lombardo said the police officer who was shot is in “extremely critical condition and on life support currently.” The second incident occurred at the courthouse on South Las Vegas Boulevard when officers who were posted at the federal building to protect it from protesters encountered a suspect at approximately 11:22 p.m. armed with multiple weapons and appeared to be wearing body armor. When authorities approached the individual, the suspect reached for one of those weapons and was subsequently shot by the responding officers. The suspect later died at the hospital. “This is a tragic night for our community,” said Lombardo. “With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another … our investigations into both these incidents will be ongoing throughout the morning.” “What has occurred is utterly, utterly unacceptable and I hope the community sees it that way too,” he concluded. 5:43 a.m.: Peaceful protests in New York City devolve into night of looting  Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd devolved Monday night into jarring moments of vandalism, looting, fire and confrontation in New York. There were more than 200 arrests and widespread vandalism in Midtown Manhattan and along Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, much of which went down after the citywide 11 p.m. curfew. Luxury brands and big box retail stores in Rockefeller Center and the Upper East Side had windows smashed and spray painted. Many more retailers boarded up their storefronts, giving the heart of a vibrant city already shuttered for the virus the look of blight. There were also several reports of officers being hit by vehicles of protesters fleeing the scenes of vandalism and looting. 4:14 a.m.: Two police officers shot in Las Vegas in separate incidents Two police officers have been shot in separate incidents in Las Vegas as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. One officer was shot near the 300 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard and the other officer was shot about two miles away in the 2800 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. The condition of the two officers is currently unknown. Police have said the scene is active and have asked the public to avoid the areas. 3:22 a.m.: Four police officers shot in St. Louis on a night of violent protests St. Louis Police Chief Hayden John Hayden held a press conference regarding four officers that were shot amid protests last night. He confirmed that all four officers have non life threatening injuries. Two were shot in the leg, one was shot in the foot and the other was shot in the arm. Police Chief Hayden said that a peaceful protest began around 3 p.m. with a couple of thousand people in attendance but that sometime later a group of about 200 people started looting. The group reportedly ignited fireworks and set them off aiming at the officers. Hayden also said the officers, who he said exhibited restraint throughout the entire ordeal, also had gas thrown on them. That is when, he said, several officers, who were standing on the line, all of a sudden felt pain and realized that they had been fired upon with four of them being hit, according to Hayden. The Police Chief also confirmed that there are still reports of gunshots being fired in the city that they’re trying to get under control. The officers were taken to hospital and treated for their wounds. The investigation into who shot them is ongoing. 1:57 a.m.: LAPD Chief apologizes for equating looters with officers involved in Floyd’s death Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore apologized for a remark he made during a mayor’s press conference Monday afternoon where he said: “We didn’t have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd, we had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers … We didn’t have protests last night. We had criminal acts.” The comment was met with immediate backlash and Black Lives Matter LA called for Moore to be fired in a tweet. Several hours later, Police Chief Moore, amid much criticism, issued an apology on Twitter saying that he misspoke during the press conference. 12:44 a.m.: Protests mostly peaceful in NYC, Denver, Louisville New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted late Monday night that any unrest has calmed down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the site of clashes between protesters and police over the last few days. De Blasio said protesters were overwhelmingly peaceful on this latest night of demonstrations, but that some people during the evening caused some damage that won’t be allowed. In Denver, protesters at the State Capitol took a knee and observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence — the same amount of time Derek Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd’s neck before Floyd died. Only the sound of helicopters above and honking in the distance could be heard. Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer also said protests in his city were largely peaceful. The mayor said the peaceful demonstrations honored the memory of David McAtee, the local restaurant owner who was shot and killed by Louisville police officers early Monday morning. 12:27 a.m.: Streets quiet in nation’s capital The city of Washington, D.C., has been relatively quiet tonight compared to the violence of the past weekend, law enforcement and homeland security officials tell ABC News. Officials report sporadic disturbances in Chinatown, where tear gas was deployed near the Convention Center. City and federal law enforcement, as well as the military, has had a heavy presence on the city streets, with aircraft, including a Black Hawk helicopter, patrolling overhead.

His parents, father Thierno Diallo and mother Thimann Jallah, immigrated to the United States from the west African county of Guinea before Chaikou and his younger sister, Aissatou Diallo, were born. In his 16 years, Chaikou has never felt discriminated against because of the color of his skin. He is friendly with police officers at Decatur Central, like Paul Tutsie and Chase Lyday. But he also knows what it is like to feel different from his white classmates, as early as first and second grade. And he has friends who have felt that discrimination in encounters with police. As he has watched the events of the past several days unfold around in the country sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis while in police custody — both in peaceful protests against police brutality and destructive riots — Chaikou felt the need to do something, anything, to get the conversation started among his peers. “I’m only 16 and will be a junior next year, so I feel like what we say probably won’t be heard as much,” Diallo said. “But I want that to change.

I have friends who feel the same way, so I decided to see how they feel about it and decided to try to do something first in my community that will help us to be heard.” Chaikou, a three-sport athlete at Decatur Central in basketball, football and track and field, already had an extensive network of friends in his school to contact. He texted 15 of his friends to start brainstorming ideas. “We want to do it in a non-violent way,” Chaikou said. “One of the ideas we have is to make individual t-shirts of different individual African-Americans who were hurt by gun violence or police brutality. Not just police, but other acts of violence too. We want to hit all aspects of it. We struggle with black-on-black crime, too.” It is just a start. Diallo said the group has discussed ways to peacefully protest. There are plans to set up a GoFundMe to donate to black-owned businesses that have been affected by the property damage caused by violent demonstrations. They have discussed ideas for a weekend youth basketball league for less fortunate families in the community. Details aside, it is perhaps more important that Diallo and his peers are prepared to shine the light on the racial issues as teenagers and engage in meaningful conversations and action. He talked it over with his mother, who volunteers for the Red Cross. “This is something new for me,” he said. “I’ve never been the type to be outgoing on something this big. But it’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot for the last couple years. Something just clicked for me that we needed to do something. It is just a matter of figuring out what to do.” Decatur Central football coach Kyle Enright said he is not surprised to see Diallo take action. He has one of the highest grade-point averages on the team at 4.1 and was voted by his teammates as one of the division commanders for the offseason despite not seeing varsity action as a sophomore. He was also the starting junior varsity point guard on the basketball team. “He’s very mature for his age to say the least,” Enright said. “He doesn’t follow the crowd. I’m proud of him, especially for such a young age. It shows you that age doesn’t matter and shows his true character. He wants change and wants to be a part of that. I’m all for it.” Diallo said “about half” of those involved in his initial text chain are athletes and most are in his class at Decatur Central. But he would like to see the still-unnamed group expand to other high schools, athletes and non-athletes, black and white. “My vision is to get the whole Indianapolis area involved in this group,” he said. “It is something anybody could join, you don’t have to be African-American.” Brandon Warren, a 2018 Warren Central graduate, earned national recognition as one of the top 10 youth volunteers in the country two years ago after organizing a city-wide peace march and community day after the shooting death of his former football teammate at Warren Central, Dijon Anderson. Warren organized the group, We LIVE Indy, to take a stand against youth violence and get civic leaders involved in the discussion. Diallo’s dream schools are Stanford or Purdue. He would like to major in mechanical engineering or business with the goal of possibly running his own business one day. But for now, as a 16-year-old and junior in high school, Diallo would like to make an impact any way he can. There would seem to be no better time than the present. “I’d like to see how far this can go,” he said. “There are a lot of us who feel the same way.” Call Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649.",0.0

According to EPD, detectives of EPD’s Violent Incident Prevention Enforcement Response (VIPER) Unit were notified of a public post on Facebook that contained a video of individuals discussing a planned riot at Evansville’s Burkhardt Rd. Walmart location. Along with the video, the post contained the caption “Riot”. Eight other Facebook profiles were tagged in the post. EPD says the video was removed from Facebook before detectives were able to preserve it. The profile that posted the video was also deleted. Based on the information gathered, EPD Detectives began to survey the Burkhardt Rd. Walmart to see if the plans of rioting would be carried out. During their surveillance, detectives became aware of a Facebook Live video by the user “Tia Tia,” who was later identified as 20-year-old Ketia Lapointe, of Orlando, Florida. In the live video, another individual appeared and was identified as 20-year-old Dave Casimir of Evansville, Indiana. Casimir was recognized by detectives as one of the eight profiles tagged in the original planning post. During the live video, Casimir made several pleas for individuals to meet him at the door of Walmart. The Facebook Live video was being broadcasted from a vehicle that the defendants were traveling in together. EPD says the vehicle arrived at the east side Walmart, at which point Lapointe, Casimir, and a third defendant, Redlher Joseph, walked into an entrance of the building. According to EPD, the group left the building and re-entered, and had taken “significant steps to riot inside of the store,” including discussing, recruiting, traveling to the location, and attempting to meet with others to carry out the crime. Detectives entered the Walmart store and detained all three defendants before anyone was harmed or any property was destroyed. After being placed in handcuffs, Lapointe began to violently and forcefully pull her arms away from an EPD Detective, but the detective was able to regain control. All three defendants continued to shout and cause a scene that attracted the attention of many bystanders, EPD said. All three defendants were arrested in addition to being barred from all Walmart properties. Arrested and Charged: Comments comments",0.0

BoghosianBy JORDYN PHELPS and BEN GITTLESON, ABC News (WASHINGTON) — It was a made-for-TV moment. President Donald Trump, Bible in hand, posing in front of the historic St. John’s Church a block from the White House Monday night, the day after the church’s basement apparently was set on fire by protesters. It came at a cost. Demonstrators who had been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting the death of George Floyd and racial injustice in policing were pushed back, forcibly, with the use of flash-bangs and tear gas to make way for the president. But the morning after the photo-op, which has been roundly criticized, Trump found no cause for regret as he posted on Twitter with his praise for the night’s events, that included the presence of hundreds of law enforcement and National Guardsmen in front of the White House. “D.C. had no problems last night,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination.” The president directly congratulated himself for what was a quieter evening than those over the weekend in both the nation’s capital and Minneapolis, writing: “Thank you President Trump!” D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!). — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020 But even as the president congratulated himself, many others found cause for condemnation. The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington said she was “outraged” by the president’s use of the historic episcopal church as a backdrop after breaking up the peaceful demonstration The Rev. Mariann Budde, the diocesan bishop who oversees St. John’s Church, said on ABC’s Good Morning America that the president’s photo-op was “as if it were spiritual validation and justification for a message that is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and to the God of justice.” Trump on Tuesday morning also visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington to lay a wreath in honor of the former Pope’s 100th birthday and later was to sign an executive order the White House said would “advance international religious freedom.” Just before he arrived, the Catholic Archbishop of Washington, Wilton D. Gregory, the nation’s most senior African American bishop, issued a blistering statement along the same lines as his Episcopal counterpart, saying the Shrine, which he does not oversee, was also being “misused” by Trump. “I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said. “Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace,” he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday also condemned the night’s event, expressing dismay that police “came out and beat” protesters to clear the way for the president. “What is that? That has no place and it’s time for us to do away with that,” said Pelosi. Noting how Trump, as he stood in front of St. John’s Church, held up a Bible, held up her own copy of the Bible in front of cameras and read several passages from the book of Ecclesiastes calling for healing. Pelosi said President Trump “has the responsibility to heal” and used the moment to highlight the stark contrast between Trump’s own words about the national protests vs what the presidents before him have said. “We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents before him and be a healer-in-chief, and not a fanner of the flame,” Pelosi said.

By Tina Burnside, Amir Vera and Eric Levenson, CNN (CNN) -- Six Atlanta Police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday. The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spelman and Morehouse, both historically black schools. They were on their way home from picking up food when they got caught in traffic downtown caused by a protest of police violence against black citizens. Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said. Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The officers have until the end of the day on June 5 to surrender, Howard said. A $10,000 signature bond has been set for all six officers. CNN is working to contact the officers. Bottoms had said she was disturbed when she saw the video and ordered charges to be dropped against the man who was tased. The woman was not charged. ""As we watch the video today, it became abundantly clear immediately with the young woman that this force was excessive,"" Bottoms said on Sunday. ""It also became abundantly clear that the officer who tased the young man needed to be terminated as well."" One of the officers wrote in a police report that he used his taser because he was unsure whether Pilgrim or Young were armed. ""I heard officers say gun two-three times,"" the officer wrote. ""Not being able to see the hands of the passenger and being that she was in my immediate sight I deployed my city issued taser to defuse the situation."" Pilgrim, 20, said she and her friend Young were riding home from protests when the incident took place. ""It was the worst experience of my life,"" she said. At Tuesday's press conference, Young had a cast on his arm. ""I feel a little safer now that these monsters are off the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else from this point on,"" he said.

1623506799,2020-06-02 07:21:08,Some governors reject President Trump's call to send in military on protesters,https://www.wthr.com/article/some-governors-reject-president-trumps-call-send-military-protesters,en,True,,68380,wthr.com,http://www.wthr.com/#spider,"SACRAMENTO, Calif (AP) — Several Democratic governors on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump's threat to deploy the U.S. military unless they dispatch National Guard units to “dominate the streets” in reaction to the violence that has erupted across the country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. My fellow Americans - My first and highest duty as President is to defend our great Country and the American People. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our Nation -- and that is exactly what I will do… pic.twitter.com/pvFxxi9BTR — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020  Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard, I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.",0.0

(WZZM) — Saturday evening, a peaceful protest over police brutality marched down the streets of Grand Rapids. Preschool teacher Veronika Ross was part of the crowd. ""I was just really proud of Grand Rapids for coming out as big as they did,"" said Ross, ""It was amazing. There was so many people there."" That peaceful protest ended and violence tore through Grand Rapids into early Sunday morning. Before that, Ross said she felt the shift, as anger began to grow. She grew concerned, after seeing many of her student's family members at the protests. So, she started to pray. ""I was just like praying to God, like God, please let everyone get home safely,"" said Ross, ""It was a little nerve-wracking to know if something were to happen, like some of these kids wouldn't have their dads anymore or like some of these people wouldn't have family members. It was just it was just terrifying."" As she prayed, a photo was taken of her by a local photographer named Denavvia Mojét. It shows her crying and standing in front of police officers wearing riot gear. What Ross said happened next took her by surprise. Another officer, though Ross did not get his name, walked up to the officer she was standing in front of in the photo. ""He was like, 'Hey, are you praying right now?' And I was like, 'Yeah,'"" said Ross, ""He was like, 'can you"" pray for us too?' And I was like, 'definitely.' And that made me cry even harder."" Ross said she left soon after, not wanting to be involved in any violence. She doesn't condone what happened later on in the evening, but she knows it comes from a place on frustration. ""It just shows how hurt and how angry people actually are,"" said Ross, ""This is something like when you take the voice away from people, they don't know what else to do. You just kind of have all that pent up anger. So, though I don't condone what they did, I understand. It's frustrating not being able to have a voice."" She says it will be a slow process to reverse hundreds of years of injustice, but she feels now their voices are being heard. ""It's terrifying that I have to remind my children on a daily the police officers are good,"" said Ross, ""but you still have to be extremely careful. I shouldn't have to say things like that."" And that moment, when the police officer asked her to pray for them, will stay with her for a long time. ""It just kind of opened my eyes that what I believe in is everyone is important,"" said Ross, ""They're all people. Though we do need justice, violence isn't the way to get that justice.""",0.0

(TEGNA/AP) — President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on Tuesday morning will visit Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington D.C. The visit follows Trump's photo op Monday night with members of his administration in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, a building that suffered damaged by fire during Sunday night's protest. Police, under federal command, used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that Trump could walk to the church and pose with a Bible. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. Protesters were seen gathering outside of the shrine, awaiting the president's arrival. For nearly a week since George Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

El-Amin, a Minneapolis native who is also black, couldn’t believe what he was looking at. The 21-year-old, who plays basketball for Ball State University, couldn’t believe he was watching another person of color die at the hands of law enforcement. He felt angry, sad, frightened, with the intensity of his emotions growing as more details of the tragedy emerged. ►RELATED: Muncie's second Floyd protest rally held at City Hall ►RELATED: Floyd protest movement reaches downtown Muncie And then as people around the country spoke out, El-Amin didn’t see enough action from the people in positions of power at Ball State and in Muncie’s local government. He got to a point where he felt he had to act, to push his community forward because “it’s time for change.” So with his roommate Sultan Benson, the BSU student on whom a university professor called the police in January for not changing seats in class, El-Amin is organizing a peaceful protest for 5 p.m. Thursday in Muncie. It will start at BSU’s Shafer Tower, and after protestors gather and hear some speakers there, they will march to Muncie’s City Hall. “We will not be quiet and we demand change,” said El-Amin, who’s encouraging participants to wear masks due to COVID-19. “Change will come, and if peaceful protesting is the way that it’s going to happen, then we’re going to show people how to do it the right way and we’re going to do it.” Stay informed Support local journalism and read more stories like this one by becoming a Star Press subscriber. Get unlimited digital access here! In the hours and days since El-Amin first tweeted Sunday about the protest — which El-Amin is adamant will be peaceful because he does not agree with looting and destruction he’s seen happen — the support for his cause among the Ball State community has become more vocal. BSU President Geoffrey S. Mearns spoke with El-Amin and tweeted Monday he’d be walking with El-Amin, too, later elaborating in another tweet that he would join in because the “peaceful procession will provide an opportunity for all of us to renew our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion,” and more. BSU’s athletic director, Beth Goetz, told The Star Press she stands with El-Amin, and admires his “willingness to bring a community of voices together to collectively confront racism.” El-Amin’s head coach, James Whitford, told The Star Press he was proud of El-Amin, and how El-Amin is “showing great leadership in helping to organize and lead the gathering, using his voice to be a catalyst for both peace (and) change.” And whether it’s others involved in athletics at Ball State or those outside it, it’s clear those three are not alone in their support for the action El-Amin is taking in putting together what will be at least the third protest to happen in the Muncie area in the past week.

Winnie is an activist herself, and growing up El-Amin and his siblings were taught about the triumphs and trials of American history, about promoting peace and justice in their communities, about how to march and protest peacefully. El-Amin and the rest have voices they have been encouraged to use. “What’s happening around us and what’s been happening for decades in America are injustices,” Winnie said. “Collectively, as an American community, we have a duty to our children, to our grandchildren, to our great-grandchildren, just as our ancestors had before us, to use our voices for justice.” Buy Photo Ball State's Ishmael El-Amin shoots past Buffalo's defense during their game at Worthen Arena Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020. (Photo: Jordan Kartholl / The Star Press) Added El-Amin: “We’re just trying to do our part and let our voices be known so that we can have change, because the only way we will see change is with the youth and the youth coming out and demanding to see a change and see a difference.” Winnie and El-Amin’s father, Khalid El-Amin, both are proud of what their son is doing. Khalid has felt fear for his son’s safety every day since the video of Floyd’s death emerged, as he has in the past because of the realities black communities face. And Winnie also has worried about him, in addition to everyone else who’s been “on the front lines protesting peacefully and are still being attacked.” But they both believe it’s important for the people of Muncie to step up and speak out. El-Amin, who feels that fear every day, said he hasn’t been told by anyone not to hold the protest, and wouldn’t listen if someone did say that to him.

Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: David Butler II, David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports) El-Amin wants the protest to show the community how tired people are of the social injustices, police brutality and more they’re seeing. He wants to express how deeply people want it all, in time, to change. And he wants, when everyone leaves, for them to see that a peaceful protest is the right way to bring a community together in support of a cause. “I want the community of Muncie to come out and be a part of this because it’s not just a Ball State thing, it’s not just for Ball State students and not just for the staff,” El-Amin said. “This is for Muncie. This is for the whole Muncie community to be a part of this and be a part of something that’s way bigger than Ball State and that’s bigger than me and them.” El-Amin has felt as if a fire’s been lit inside him ever since he saw how many people, and not just people of color, have been hurt and have been suffering since other protests he's attended in the past. He’s chosen this moment to step out front and lead. “Start that dialogue and start that conversation because the country needs to have that and it’s time that we make a change about that,” Khalid said. “If not, we’re going to have more problems like we’ve seen over the past week.” Added Winnie, quoting a piece called “Ella’s Song”: “We who believe in freedom cannot rest.” Jordan Guskey covers Ball State and East Central Indiana high schools at the Star Press.

But she also wants to know – what’s next? “I would like to see as a whole, all police departments take a step back, look at their training, what they can do and make a plan to end (police brutality),” Leshae said. “We need answers, and until we do, this chaos is not going to stop. If you want this to end, do something about it. That’s the only way.” Buy Photo Protesters rally through downtown Lafayette, Sunday, May 31, 2020. Protesters marched in response to the police involved killing of George Floyd. (Photo: Nikos Frazier | Journal & Courier) There seemed to be two different parts to Sunday night – the planned, peaceful protest led by Leshae, and the events after the planned march ended, where tensions escalated between protesters and police that ended with tear gas being thrown to disperse crowds. At one point Sunday, demonstrates filled three to four city blocks while marching through downtown Lafayette and into West Lafayette. Leshae, a 2006 graduate of Lafayette Jeff, said she was moved and angered by Floyd’s death, which occurred last week in Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, held him down with a knee into his neck as a bystander recorded video. Chauvin was fired and later arrested for murder. Leshae said she felt very proud and moved by Sunday’s experience and was amazed to see the large turnout that came from a Facebook post she had originally meant to share with a few friends. Her demonstration followed similar ones in hundreds of U.S. cities. She also said she felt “disgust” about the chaos that occurred later Sunday evening and Monday. “I understand why people are so angry,” Leshae said. “I don’t believe this is the right way to do it, but understand why.” More: Tear gas came without warning, followed explosion as courthouse rally gave way to chaos The official march ran from 8 to 9 p.m. Sunday, although there were groups joining long before and staying long after. Organizers said that anything that occurred after 9 p.m. was not part of their event. A smaller protest occurred Monday night, with around 100 people gathering downtown. More tear gas and pepper spray was used by police, but near the end of the night, police and protesters took a knee in solidarity on the corner of South and Fourth streets. Moving forward, leaders, including Rev. Rodney Lynch, pastor and director of the Baptist Student Foundation at Purdue and co-chair of the community's Diversity Round Table, said he wants a collaboration between faith leaders to meet with mayors, police chiefs and other elected officials to make “systemic change in politics, with politicians and in policies … to make sure police violence is prevented.” More: Protesters rally in downtown Lafayette for a second night “Racism is not black peoples’ problem,” Lynch said. “I don’t need a pill for the disease called racism. White people set up the social construct of race, now they need to do the work to deconstruct it. I can support, I can help, but I can’t do the work for them, and black people shouldn’t be called to do the work. We need to get past conversations, and call for white people to repent on the lie and the ideology that white is superior and black is inferior. That’s what’s next.” Other cities around the country and in Indiana, including Indianapolis, Evansville and Fort Wayne have held similar protests, with some moving over multiple days and violence in clashes between police and protesters. At the close of Monday night’s West Lafayette City Council meeting, council member Gerald Thomas thanked West Lafayette Mayor John Dennis and other city officials for speaking up for racial justice. Thomas said he was “incredibly heartbroken” about Floyd’s murder, a recent delivery of Ku Klux Klan recruiting materials found in Tippecanoe County driveways and ways black Americans are profiled for doing things that are as commonplace as walking and bird watching in parks. “My heart is broken because of the violence we’ve seen,” Thomas said during comments in which his voice cracked several times. More: Tear gas came without warning, followed explosion as courthouse rally gave way to chaos “My heart’s broken for the protesters who are screaming, ‘Enough is enough,’ and have been screaming that for decades,” Thomas, who is African American, said. “When will we as a nation strive to make meaningful change and not supply lip service to the problem, again and again and again? We’re hurting as a nation. The problem is not a black community problem. It’s an American problem. And America needs to come together to solve it. We have to have a change of heart and a change of mind to address these issues. I hope we can come together as a nation.” Sadie Harper Scott, president of the NAACP Lafayette/West Lafayette branch, attended the march and said she was impressed by the turnout and the overall peaceful nature of the protest. Harper-Scott left around 10 p.m. Sunday, before tensions escalated and tear gas was deployed by police close to 11 p.m. ""Sometimes it’s a touchy conversation when we start talking about race and color,"" Harper-Scott said. ""We’re all willing to express what happened in Minneapolis. We never know when we’ll be faced with that, but at least we have each other, and as a community we can bridge our gaps and be dialoguing with each other.” Harper-Scott said Greater Lafayette is lucky with the leadership it has and the willingness from the Lafayette and West Lafayette mayors, the police chiefs and other officers present, and felt that the police presence was not a threat, but rather a group of people willing to listen to the protesters. “The expression of coming together while feeling sad broken-hearted and mistrusted, and those who felt like they couldn’t believe what was going on, there were all kinds of thoughts running through peoples’ minds last night,” Harper-Scott said. “We just have to make sure we’re meeting people where they are.” Kirsten Gibson, one of the directors of the Greater Lafayette chapter of a group called Showing Up for Racial Justice, said her group was there Sunday to show support for protesters and to support the missions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Gibson said she was concerned with police presence Sunday – the lack thereof on the streets directing crowds and traffic during the peaceful demonstration, then the sudden influx of police as events began to become more tense later in the evening. “When the officer appeared on the second floor of the courthouse and dropped the tear gas, that went from zero to 100,” Gibson said. “That leaves a huge question for me — are the police really doing everything they can do keep the peace, or are they waiting for something to happen and come in with excessive force? I think it shows a huge mistrust on the part of the police force of their own community.” Dennis, who attended part of Sunday night’s demonstration, told city council members Monday night that he expected to see more rallies in the coming days and possibly weeks, even if they were micro-versions of the initial protest at the courthouse. Dennis said he was encouraging people to be smart and cautious when going to one, as he made a distinction between organizers and attendees who he said had legitimate concerns about racial justice and policing from “bad actors” he believed were infiltrating crowds just to stir up trouble. “I would never ask anybody to not attend such an important event and to not to make some very focused statements about the causative factors of George Floyd’s death,” Dennis said. “It was horrendous. It was sickening. And it should never have happened. … In the event that anybody’s in my voice hears this or people you know and care about hear this, if they’re going to attend any of the marches … please, be careful. Please go with a friend. Please do your part to express your disgust in this action, but be sure to look after yourself and each other. And when the event concludes, try to leave as efficiently as possible.” Dennis, who retired as Lafayette’s deputy police chief before running for mayor, was asked by a few council members about the use of tear gas to disperse crowds on Sunday. In particular, they asked, should police have warned people that tear gas was about to fly. Dennis said police tactics generally are to take aggressors by surprise. Dennis said he backed how police at the courthouse and those in the streets performed, saying the crowd was starting to damage property. “The best advice I can give to the innocents is, if you see bad things happening, go the other way,” Dennis said.

Roughly a half hour before the curfew went into effect, law enforcement began pushing back the crowd of protesters gathered outside the White House with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets. President Donald Trump on Monday night delivered remarks in the White House Rose Garden and then — after the protesters were dispersed — walked over to the St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been partially burned in a Sunday evening protest, to pose for a photo-op with a Bible. “We wanted to make sure that our Metropolitan Police Department could ensure that people could exercise their First Amendment rights, but also protect our city from damage and destruction that we had seen the night before,” Bowser told CNN Tuesday. “But at no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else receive that treatment.” The Democratic mayor has clashed with Trump over the city’s handling of the Floyd protests.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) (CNN) — A Twitter account that tweeted a call to violence and claimed to be representing the position of “Antifa” was in fact created by a known white supremacist group, Twitter said Monday. The company removed the account. Before it emerged the account was run by white supremacists, Donald Trump Jr., President Donald Trump’s son, pointed his 2.8 million Instagram followers to the account as an example how dangerous Antifa is. “This account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. “We took action after the account sent a Tweet inciting violence and broke the Twitter Rules.” Although the account only had a few hundred followers, it is an example of white supremacists seeking to inflame tensions in the United States by posing as left-wing activists online. The revelation of the account comes as President Donald Trump increasingly blames left-wing activists for violence occurring at protests across America. On Sunday, Trump tweeted he would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, despite the US government having no existing legal authority to do so. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad, loosely-organized group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far-left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many people espousing those beliefs support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get out their messages. The fake account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted Sunday, “ALERT Tonight’s the night, Comrades Tonight we say “F**k The City” and we move into the residential areas… the white hoods…. and we take what’s ours #BlacklivesMaters #F**kAmerica.” “Absolutely insane,” Trump Jr. wrote on Instagram, sharing a screenshot of the tweet, “Just remember what ANTIFA really is. A Terrorist Organization! They’re not even pretending anymore.” A spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. did not provide comment to CNN Tuesday morning, but later the post was removed from Trump Jr.’s Instagram feed. There is no indication whatsoever that Trump Jr. knew who was behind the account or that it was fake. Twitter said that the account was in fact linked to Identity Evropa, a white power fraternity. Though Twitter referred to the group as Identity Evropa when discussing the account’s removal, the Anti Defamation League (ADL) states that the group dissolved and reformed under the name the American Identitarian Movement, which it also calls a white supremacist group. The group promotes itself as “identitarian,” that white people should preserve their racial and cultural identity. The American Identitarian Movement says it prohibits violence and illegal activity. CNN has reached out to the group for comment. Twitter said it had shut down other fake accounts linked to Identity Evropa, too. The phenomenon of people on the right creating fake Antifa accounts predates the current wave of protests. The takedown Monday is not the first time a fake Antifa account linked to white supremacists has been suspended by Twitter, the spokesperson confirmed.",0.0

In a speech in Philadelphia, the presumptive Democratic 2020 presidential nominee addressed systemic racism and empathized with those who are protesting across the nation in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in ways Trump has not. His remarks offered a striking contrast to Trump that came about 16 hours after peaceful protesters in a park outside the White House were hit with tear gas so that Trump could cross the park and visit St. John’s Church for a photo opportunity — a move that the Episcopal bishop that oversees the church later condemned. “I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain. I’ll do my job and I’ll take responsibility — I won’t blame others,” Biden said. It was Biden’s first trip outside Delaware in months after the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to in-person campaign activities. It came amid protests in major cities across the nation — accompanied by looting and property damage in some cities, as well as police violence targeting protesters. Building on his campaign’s core theme that the “soul of the nation” is at stake, Biden made explicit his differences in approach from Trump, who on Monday urged governors to “dominate” protesters, and bragged on Twitter Tuesday morning that “overwhelming force” and “domination” had been on display in the nation’s capital. Biden also challenged Americans: “Look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be?” “Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren — fear, anger, finger-pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be, the America we know in our hearts we could be and should be?” Biden said. The former vice president reserved his harshest words for Trump’s trip across Lafayette Square on Monday evening, when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a peaceful crowd. Trump visited St. John’s Church, where he held up a Bible and posed for photographs with staffers and Cabinet members, but did not offer a prayer. “The president held up the Bible at St. John’s Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,” Biden said. “If he opened it, he could have learned something.” The speech comes at a fraught moment for the nation, after seven days of protests as uncertainty looms over where a country already rocked by a pandemic and the soaring job losses it has forced will go from here. Biden called on Congress to make a “down payment” on what he said would be the “work of a generation” in excising systemic racism, including launching a national police oversight board if he is elected in November. He said lawmakers should outlaw police choke holds, stop transferring “weapons of war” to police departments and increase oversight and accountability of police departments. “It’s time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of legal protection under the law,” Biden said. Biden has provided a dramatic contrast with Trump in recent days. Biden has spoken with Floyd’s family and on Sunday visited the site of a protest in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. On Monday, as Trump urged governors in a phone call to “dominate” protesters, Biden held a discussion with African American community leaders in Wilmington and a virtual roundtable with the mayors of cities that have seen protests and violence: Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. Biden also directly addressed Floyd’s killing, calling it “a wake-up call for our nation” as he began his speech. “‘I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.’ George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation,” Biden said. “They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment — with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities,” Biden said. “And they speak to a nation where every day millions of people — not at the moment of losing their life — but in the course of living their life — are saying to themselves, ‘I can’t breathe.'”",0.0

MUHAMMAD ALI WOULD HAVE CONDEMNED VIOLENT GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS, EX-WIFE SAYS Kieran Stewart-Assheton, who helped organize Tuesday’s demonstration, said it was in solidarity with the U.S. and to raise awareness about the same racial inequality targeting Australia’s indigenous population. “We are here to stand in solidarity with the African-American community, and we are here to raise awareness of indigenous deaths in custody and the atrocious rates that Indigenous people are incarcerated in Australia,” Stewart-Assheton told the Guardian. “We hear about everything that happens overseas in the mainstream media. But we turn a blind eye to what happens in our own backyards. There has been an outpouring of support in white media for Black Lives Matter in the US, but a lot of these people are unaware of what is happening here in Australia.” PROTESTS SPARKED BY GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH GET SUPPORT FROM AROUND THE WORLD Tuesday’s demonstration also came as footage emerged showing an indigenous 16-year-old in Surry Hills slammed face-first to the pavement by a Sydney police officer during an arrest. A relative told the Guardian the boy was taken to the hospital after the arrest and treated for bruising, cuts to his knee, face, and elbow and chipped teeth. It was not immediately clear what led to the arrest. Police said the officer was patrolling Surry Hills, a suburb of Sydney, when he encountered a group of teenagers. In a statement, a spokesperson said the teenager threatened an officer, leading to the arrest. An internal investigation is underway, and the police officer was placed on “restricted duties.” “It happens so often. It is an Australian problem. We are sick of it,” said Stewart-Assheton. Mick Willing, the assistant commissioner for the NSW Police, told reporters that he is “concerned” by the footage of the arrest but that he was “equally concerned about others who may use this footage to turn the incident into something it’s not.” “We’re all well aware of what’s happening overseas, but this is not the United States of America,” he said, according to local media. He did not say whether he believed the police officer’s action was appropriate.

The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens. Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said. Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The officers have until the end of the day on June 5 to surrender, Howard said. A $10,000 signature bond has been set for all six officers. CNN is working to contact the officers. Bottoms had said she was disturbed when she saw the video and ordered charges to be dropped against the man who was tased. The woman was not charged. “As we watch the video today, it became abundantly clear immediately with the young woman that this force was excessive,” Bottoms said on Sunday. “It also became abundantly clear that the officer who tased the young man needed to be terminated as well.” One of the officers wrote in a police report that he used his taser because he was unsure whether Pilgrim or Young were armed. “I heard officers say gun two-three times,” the officer wrote. “Not being able to see the hands of the passenger and being that she was in my immediate sight I deployed my city issued taser to defuse the situation.” Pilgrim, 20, said she and her friend Young were riding home from protests when the incident took place. “It was the worst experience of my life,” she said. At Tuesday’s press conference, Young had a cast on his arm. “I feel a little safer now that these monsters are off the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else from this point on,” he said.",0.0

Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (AP) — Embracing the language of confrontation and war, President Donald Trump declared himself the “president of law and order” and signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach, including deploying U.S. troops to U.S. cities, was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Trump made his Rose Garden declaration on Monday evening to the sound of tear gas and rubber bullets clearing peaceful protesters from the park in front of the White House. It created a split screen for the ages, with his critics saying the president was deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. The president’s forceful turn to a partisan posture was reminiscent of the us-vs.-them rhetoric he has often used when under pressure, including in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. He has responded to the violence with a string of polarizing tweets, one starkly laying out the political stakes by underscoring the approach of Election Day. “NOVEMBER 3RD,” was all it said. Trump vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America’s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. He offered little recognition of the anger coursing through the country as he demanded a harsher crackdown on the mayhem that has erupted following the death of George Floyd. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed his neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in dozens of cities across the nation, marking a level of widespread turmoil unseen for decades. The political ground beneath Trump has greatly shifted in the spring of this election year. He was supposed to be running on a strong economy, but now he’s facing a pandemic, an economic collapse and civil unrest not seen since the 1960s. Indeed, some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots and captured the White House. But Trump is the incumbent and, despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, he risks being held responsible for the violence. Trump emerged after two days out of public view in the White House to threaten to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in the protests. That brought a quick condemnation from Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. But he had his campaign moment. In a video teleconference Monday morning, Trump scolded governors. “Most of you are weak,” he said. “It’s like a war. And we will end it fast. Be tough.” “You have to dominate” and “if you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump said, demanding the protests be swiftly crushed, even as some warned that such an aggressive law enforcement response could lead to an escalation of violence. He urged governors to make more use of the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’re going to arrest all those people and you’re going to try them. And if they get five years or 10 years, they have to get five years or 10 years,” the president said. “So I say that, and the winners dominate.” Trump’s exhortations came after a night of escalating violence, with images of chaos overshadowing largely peaceful protests. The disturbances grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground White House bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. Some West Wing officials and political advisers have acknowledged that some of the president’s tweets have not been helpful, and they have been pushing Trump to acknowledge the pain of the peaceful protesters without lumping them in with the agitators he says are responsible for the violence. But another faction within the administration, including longtime law-and-order proponent Attorney General William Barr, has encouraged Trump’s instincts to focus on the group violence. The hope is such a posture can help Trump draw a contrast with Democrats who have been less vocal in their condemnation of the unrest. Among the options being discussed in the White House: a new criminal justice reform package, a task force that would include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and a listening tour of African American communities, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because nothing had been finalized. Democrats hammered Trump, accusing him of stirring the unrest. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” said the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, speaking at a church in Wilmington, Delaware. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “struggles to summon even an ounce of humanity in this time of turmoil.” “The president has reacted to the pain and anger in the country by playing politics and encouraging police to be tougher on protesters by bragging about his reelection prospects and his personal safety inside the White House,” Schumer said. Trump and his advisers believe that the combative rhetoric and promises to send the military into cities will reassure voters, including senior citizens and suburban women, concerned by the lawlessness. Eager to change the narrative of the election, just five months away, from a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump and his aides see a cultural war issue that could captivate his base.",0.0

The shock of seeing their business is in shambles was a lot for owners to take in. One downtown business owner said there was some frustration at first, but it led to understanding that there’s a deeper problem. The damage reflected around downtown Indianapolis is a mirror image of other cities across the country after days of protest, following a Minneapolis man’s death after an encounter with police. “I mean I was shocked knowing that we are a black-owned business. I know and I understand the reason why they are protesting,” Romeo Gerson, Michael’s Soul Kitchen co-owner, said. People damaged businesses of all kinds, including black-owned businesses that include Michael’s Soul Kitchen. “We were supposed to be opening this week, doing more delivery and pickup. With this happening, we’ll just have to push it a few more days,” Gerson said. He said it was a shock to see the restaurant hit with $10,000 worth of damage. Despite the damage, he says the community is also making sure it’s getting fixed. “We understand we weren’t actually the target and we’ll just move forward,” Gerson said. The Indy Black Chamber of Commerce said businesses like this are vital to the local black economy. George Middleton is a therapist and chamber board member. He watched the weekend’s events unfold. “It’s understandable, again, I’m coming from a mental health perspective. You’re seeing repressed generational effects of trauma,” Middleton said. He said the chamber is moving a bit faster with plans that were already in the works to better assist black-owned businesses. The chamber will soon kick off its mental health disparities initiative and a three part series called “The Knee.” “Cleaning up and addressing our environment has to be one of our initiatives,” he said.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm — the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___ Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts.",0.0

Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won’t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation. “Antifa knows this,” said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Local and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.” Several analysts pointed to places that have served as something of “testbed” locations – including Madison, Wis., which was ransacked Saturday night, along with quiet pockets of Charleston, S.C. GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: HOW RIOT GROUPS COME TOGETHER TO LOOT, DESTROY While it remains murky as to who exactly is behind the ongoing turbulence taking place in dozens of cities nationwide, much of the finger-pointing has been directed toward Antifa, a radical left-wing anti-fascist outfit. But most officials and analysts have surmised that there a number of players and agendas with regards to the rioting, which has overshadowed the peaceful protests calling out racial inequalities and police brutality directed toward African-Americans. But even before riots exploded across the United States in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, federal and local officials have long been investigating the inner workings and revenue stream of the anarchist, left-wing outfit. And arrests among its highest ranks may be imminent. Intelligence sources pointed out that indictments have been building for some time, and a close examination of funding revenues remains under the microscope. While Antifa operates as something of a leaderless militant wing, sources closely engaged in the matter said that there are identifiable top brass driving and inciting criminal activity. “These are smart people, educated people and it runs like a cell right out of the anti-fascist tradecraft books of Europe in the 1970s, it doesn’t have a head or hierarchy, but it has a lot of local leadership,” the government insider explained. “The local apparatus has very good intelligence capabilities, but where their weaknesses are is in communication and using apps that allow for large group chats.” An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there. “People in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,” said the source. “There is just a lot of confusion and fear.” Moreover, the group’s “electronic communication” shows that they plan where to show up and typically arrive at pre-determined locations on bikes. LOOTERS RUN WILD IN BRONX AS VIDEO SHOWS NYPD OFFICER BEING BEATEN: ‘FORDHAM IS ON FIRE’ While Antifa is alleged to be playing a prominent role in the chaos – prompting President Trump to announce plans to label them a terrorist organization – on the other end of the spectrum, right-wing radical groups are also believed to be stoking the fires and capitalizing on the calamity. Twitter said Tuesday that it had suspended the account of a white supremacist group for spreading discord and disinformation across the social media platform, using the “Antifa_US” umbrella and threatening to go into the “white hoods.” Furthermore, law enforcement officials have also stressed that much of criminal activity and stealing is also stemming from opportunistic individuals with no greater intention than to steal and wreack havoc, with no broader ideological leanings.

A petition posted to Change.org to remove the California chief had received more than 8,000 signatures by 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, according to the Santa Monica Lookout. Its creator, Oliver Greene, said officers lacked the “strong leadership and overarching strategy to protect themselves, our city, and its citizens.” What began as a peaceful protest in Santa Monica on Sunday over the death of George Floyd descended into violence and some people began looting businesses, including banks, chain stores and smaller mom-and-pop shops and restaurants. SANTA MONICA FACES RIOTS, LOOTING AMID GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS Live broadcasts showed officers watching as people ransacked stores and emptied shelves. Though more than 400 people have been taken into custody on charges like looting, violating curfew, burglary and assault, those arrests did not come until after the businesses were destroyed. Renaud has said 95 percent of those arrested for looting did not live in Santa Monica, WABC reported. “Many of us have witnessed firsthand the deterioration of the Santa Monica police force’s ability to maintain order and decency on our streets over the last few years — from record numbers of burglaries and violent crimes to willfully allowing rampant vagrancy,” Greene wrote. “After seeing the widespread looting and vandalism of our city and local businesses, we can do better,” the petition continued. “After seeing our brave law enforcement officers stand by without strong leadership or overarching strategy to protect themselves, our city, and its citizens, we have to do better. “After seeing SMPD Chief Cynthia Renaud conduct a blundering press conference that was completely misaligned with the current realities, we must do better,” it said. “We need and deserve strong, resounding leadership in Santa Monica’s police force, particularly during today’s volatile times.

On Tuesday, places like the Jasper Riverwalk, Hometown IGA, and the Jasper Walmart were found to be spray painted with phrases such as “We Shall Overcome” “Justice 4 Floyd”, and “I Can’t Breathe”. These phrases reference protests rising across the United States after the deaths of people like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. We spoke with Jasper Mayor Dean Vonderheide about the vandalism. He says that the city won’t tolerate vandalism and calls it disrespectful. Vonderheide also says that acts like spray painting local businesses will not help solve tensions regarding racial injustice. “They think that this is going to help. Graffiti doesn’t help. This is destruction. This is defacing of assets that have been blood sweat and tears of local residents and their businesses. It’s unfortunate that people feel like they have to use graffiti as a means for expressing themselves rather than vocally getting involved in peaceful demonstrations like the one that took place last Saturday.” Regarding the peaceful protest held by ONE – Dubois County, which took place last Saturday at the Dubois County Courthouse, Vonderheide says that the event helped people learn and raise awareness. “Well, I thought it was it was handled well. It seemed to be well-organized. People had the right intent, which was to bring awareness and to drive change. Part of driving changes to educate and I think that group did a nice job of trying to educate citizens and bring the awareness to the forefront.” Vonderheide says that he understands the Black Lives Matter movement and the reason behind it. He compliments ONE – Dubois County for the work they are doing. ONE – Dubois County issued the following statement to us. “Black people are harmed every day by systemic racism. The protests, nationally and the one held locally on Saturday, are about protecting the lives of Black people by dismantling the systems of murder and oppression. This message has been eclipsed by vandalism. ONE-DC continues to work towards our common goals of civil and human rights.” Vonderheide acknowledges that the city tries to be welcoming to everyone, but he knows that that is not always the case. “I really feel like as a community we try to embrace. Yes, there are differences. Yes, we don’t do as well as we should when it comes to handling diversity; but by no means are we accepting anything with responsibility toward brutality. To me, brutality is the message. It’s not necessarily the police brutality. It’s brutality in general.” We also spoke with Jasper Police Chief Nathan Schmitt about the vandalism. “They’re extremely disappointing. Anytime somebody’s going out and defacing city property, public property, and other people’s property, it’s disappointing to us. If you have a message to share, that’s not the way to go about doing that.” Schmitt says the Jasper Police Department is following a few leads on trying to find out who did this. Schmitt says that they have been aware and prepared for similar incidents since last Thursday when the Jasper Riverwalk was defaced in a separate place. “We’ve had four incidents in the last 5 days. So, I would guess that they’re local. I think it’s probably somebody that doesn’t really have a lot to do with the movement. They are just trying to spark outrage in the community and the deface property because it’s not a way to increase your movement or get force behind your movement. It’s actually, from what we have experienced at the police department, we’re finding out it had the exact opposite effect.” Schmitt says that the police department has received several calls from concerned citizens about what they can do to help the police department find the suspects. Schmitt says that he and the rest of the police force aren’t worried about tensions escalating in Dubois County like other areas around the country. He says this is because of the good relationships the department has with its citizens. “We don’t have a lot of fear down here that we’re going to have some of the issues that other communities have because of the great people in this community and the support that we have of the community. The partnerships that we built over the years and our ability to work together and solve a lot of problems.” If anyone has any information about these incidents, call the Jasper Police Department at 812-482-2255.",0.0

(TEGNA) — The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons announced Monday that it is placing its facilities on temporary lockdown amid unrest. The decision was made after violent clashes between protesters and police erupted across the country over the death of George Floyd. ""In light of extensive protest activity occurring around the country, the BOP – in an abundance of caution – is implementing an additional, temporary security measure to ensure the good order and security of our institutions, as well as ensure the safety of staff and inmates,"" the bureau said in a statement according to USA Today and CBS News. The statement added: ""In securing our facilities, our hope is that this security measure is short-lived and that inmates will be restored to limited movement the very near future."" USA Today said that the lockdown was not prompted by inmate actions. The federal prison system had also implemented a temporary measure to further curtail inmate movement at prisons across the U.S. “to ensure the good order and security of our institutions, as well as ensure the safety of staff and inmates,"" the Bureau of Prisons said. Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. Under the bureau’s guidelines, priority is supposed to be given to those inmates who have served half of their sentence or inmates with 18 months or less left and who served at least 25% of their time. The bureau has discretion about who can be released -- and used it in Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen’s cases. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Barr on Monday encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air.

After starting in Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed after an officer dug his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded to be allowed to breathe, the protests have spread nationwide. Demonstrators have demanded justice for Floyd, as well as Arbery and Taylor, and voiced a larger message for the need to end police brutality and institutionalized racism across the nation, as well. Blackout Tuesday was initiated by two black women, Jamila Thomas and Briana Agyemang, in the music industry, according to TheShowMustBePaused.com. Major music labels across the country are joining forces to support their black artists. No new music will be released on June 2, the website details. ""We will not continue to conduct business as usual without regard for Black Lives,"" the website states. The #BlackoutTuesday hashtag on Instagram has generated more than 4.5 million posts as of around 8 a.m., with users posting a simple black square to show support. The organizers detail how this is not just a day-long fight, but a step in the right direction to correct years worth of institutionalized wrongdoing. It is also not, activists have noted, intended as a day of silence. Rather, as Twitter user Nicole Raquel Dennis wrote, it's being framed as a ""day to halt self-promotion, stop streaming etc and support the movement."" ""IT IS A PROTEST!!!!!!

""DO NOT USE"" trended on Twitter, with people explaining why it was important not to use #BlackLivesMatter on #BlackoutTuesday posts.

Biden said Trump's “narcissism has become more important than the nation that he leads.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall, addressing the civil unrest across America following the death of George Floyd. Biden said ""the moment has come” to deal with systemic racism and deeply ingrained economic inequality — and insisted that the nation can't wait until November's election and its outcome. “I call on the Congress to act this month,"" Biden said, urging lawmakers to start “with real police reform"" and citing proposed legislation outlawing chokeholds. But Biden stepped up his criticism of Trump as he works to elevate his voice in the national debate — after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronarvius. “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego."" Biden’s criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation’s governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation. Authorities under federal command later forced back peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to nearby church St. John’s Church and pose briefly with a Bible. The church had sustained damage during Sunday protests. Biden noted that “peaceful protesters” were dispersed from the “doorstep of the people’s house, the White House” using tear gas and flash grenades to stage what he called a “photo op” publicity stunt. “The president held up a Bible,” Biden added. “I just wished he opened it once in awhile instead of brandishing it.” The 20-plus minute address was covered live by cable networks and Biden used it to declare, ""This job’s not about me. It’s about you. It’s about us.” “Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either,” Biden said, but promised, ""I won’t fan the flames of hate.” As the former vice president spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, was on hand. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the “president of law and order.” Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,” Biden said.",0.0

Reading from Bible scripture at the Capitol, Pelosi drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush speaking in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. “We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,” Pelosi said. The remarks of the California Democrat, who is the party's top ranking elected official, offered a stark contrast to the Republican president as the world watches a nation in turmoil. Pelosi criticized the use of force to disperse the crowd of protesters late Monday at the White House so Trump could cross the street to nearby St. John's church in what was widely seen as a photo opportunity and was later criticized by the Episcopal congregation's bishop. “Some people came out and beat them so they could clear the area so the president could come out and go forward. What is that?” asked Pelosi. “That has no place and it's time for us to do away with that.” Pelosi, a Catholic who regularly attends Mass, said there were so many passages that Trump could have relied on during his visit to the church. He held up a Bible during the event but did not refer to it during brief remarks. She quoted from the book of Ecclesiastes, saying it is a “time to heal.” “It is the responsibility of all of us to take the time to heal,” she said.",0.0

(WEHT) The Kentucky chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Kentucky) demanded Tuesday that all officers involved in the shooting death of African-American business owner David McAtee in Louisville be fired. This comes one day after the Associated Press reported Monday that Louisville’s police chief was fired following the incident. McAtee died early Monday while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer later revealed that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation into the shooting. Governor Andy Beshear said on Monday that it is unacceptable that body cameras were not on and recording during the Sunday night protest where McAtee was shot and killed. In a statement, Waheedah Muhammad, chair of CAIR-Kentucky said: “We are horrified that while Kentucky citizens, along with the entire nation and world, are reeling from the horrific video of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, and while the Black community of Louisville is also hurting and protesting the shooting death of Breonna Taylor — who also died at the hands of Louisville police — that we have yet another unarmed member of the African-American community die at the hands of police. The firing of Chief Conrad cannot be a cover. All officers involved in this incident should be fired.” She added that the firing of LMPD’s Police Chief, Steve Conrad is a welcomed first step but does not go far enough in holding those responsible for the death of David McAtee accountable for the breach of police protocol in that they were not wearing their body cameras.

To actually do so, he would need to employ what’s known as the Insurrection Act of 1807. Here are the basics: What is the Insurrection Act? Signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, the Insurrection Act empowers the American president and commander in chief to deploy military troops within the U.S. in particular circumstances, if they believe it is necessary to quell an “insurrection” that threatens a state or its residents. It’s essentially a legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces — whether through federalizing the National Guard or calling in “Title X forces” to settle civil unrest. The exception to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits active-duty troops from being deployed to U.S. states for routine use as police forces, is an important and expansive power granted to the president. When has it been invoked? The Insurrection Act has rarely been invoked in the 213 years it’s been on the books — but in modern times, presidents have typically assumed the power to deal with the American agony of racial conflict, even relying on the provision to uphold federal civil rights in the Deep South. In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower called on the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division to safely escort nine black students into Little Rock Central High School after the Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, using the Arkansas National Guard under the guise of maintaining peace, tried to prevent the students from entering the school. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions to Detroit when deadly riots broke out between police and residents. President John F. Kennedy invoked the law in 1958 in the face of massive Southern resistance to federal civil rights laws and in response to protests sparked by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. And in 1992, President George H.W. Bush responded to a request from Gov. Pete Wilson of California to help quell rioting in Los Angeles after the acquittal of the four LAPD officers who brutally beat Rodney King. The act was revised after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to expand presidential power and again in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Under President George W. Bush and Lt. General Russell Honore, thousands of active duty troops were sent to New Orleans — despite the objections of nearly every governor in the country at the time to expand the power.  How can it be invoked? The Insurrection Act can be invoked at a state’s request. A state legislature or governor could request assistance from the president to “to suppress [an] Insurrection.” The law states: “If there is an insurrection in a State, the President, at the request of the State’s legislature, or Governor if the legislature cannot be convened, may call National Guards of other States into Federal service as well as use the Federal military to suppress the insurrection.” Two other Insurrection Act provisions allow a president to invoke it regardless of a state’s wishes. One provision permits it to be invoked if the president deems it necessary “to suppress an insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy.” The law states: “Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages or rebellion against authority of United States makes it impracticable to enforce the law of the United States in any State or territory by judicial proceedings, the President may call into Federal service the militia of any State and use the Federal military to enforce the laws or suppress the rebellion.” A third option — the most generalized provision — says the president can use the armed forces when there is an interference with federal or state law. The president may use the military to suppress insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy if “(a) it so hinders the execution of law of that State and of the United States and it deprives citizens of constitutional rights (e.g. due process); or (b) it opposes or obstructs the execution of laws or impedes the course of justice. In the event of the deprivation of rights, the State is deemed to have denied its citizens equal protection of laws.” But first, a proclamation to disperse: Prior to invoking the Insurrection Act, the president and the attorney general must first issue a “proclamation to disperse.” If the situation is not cleared, the president may then issue an executive order to send in troops, according to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service. Has Trump invoked it? The White House has not issued a proclamation text, and President Trump didn’t use the words “Insurrection Act” in his Monday night statement. But at least one Republican has already recommended it: Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a staunch conservative, advocated on Twitter that Trump employ the 101st Airborne Division. The most notable time 101st Airborne Division was in Cotton’s home state was in 1957 when Eisenhower used the Insurrection Act to force desegregation and safely escort nine black students into Little Rock Central High School. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, was quick to dispute Trump’s comments, rejecting the idea that the government can send troops to his jurisdiction. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,” Pritzker told CNN. “He wants to change the subject from his failure over coronavirus, a miserable failure, and now see a moment when there’s unrest because of the injustice that was done to George Floyd that he now wants to create another topic and something where he can be the law and order president.” An ABC analysis: John Cohen, former Acting Undersecretary for Intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, who is now an ABC News contributor, noted the U.S. military, as formidable as it is, isn’t trained specifically to deal with civil unrest in the U.S. “Placing U.S. military personnel in the position of potentially using deadly force against other U.S. citizens is not something that should be done in a cavalier manner,” Cohen said. “The experience of its deployment during the Los Angeles riots faced many logistical communication and operational challenges,” added Cohen, also a former police officer who worked in Los Angeles county. “It wasn’t seen as a successful operation by many.” Read the original text: The original text of the act, which has been amended several times since it was first passed on March 3, 1807, reads as follows: “An Act authorizing the employment of the land and naval forces of the United States, in cases of insurrections. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases of insurrection, or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States, or of any individual state or territory, where it is lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection, or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ, for the same purposes, such part of the land or naval force of the United States, as shall be judged necessary, having first observed all the pre-requisites of the law in that respect.” One more thing: When the Insurrection Act was used in 1992, Attorney General William Barr was serving as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.  ABC News’ Martha Raddatz, Luis Martinez, Terry Moran and Trish Tuner contributed to this report. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

With reports that law enforcement used tear gas to disperse peaceful protestors in advance of Trump’s visit to the church, Schumer also called on the Pentagon’s inspector general to lead an investigation into how the military was used at Lafayette Park in tandem with the president’s photo opportunity. “After the gas, came the horses — a modern-day cavalry was clearing the battlefield. The purpose, so that President Trump could wave a Bible, not read a Bible, not even his Bible, as a prop,” Schumer said. “It was appalling. It was an abuse of presidential power. It may well have been illegal and it was blatantly unconstitutional.” Moments earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded local, state and federal officials for working to “restore peace” amid raging civil unrest across the country, maintaining his disdain for violence associated with the protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. During remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning, McConnell called for a distinction between peaceful protests and “violent riots.” “The former is a cherished constitutional right that ever single citizen should support. The latter is an unacceptable scourge that state and local leaders should have ended days ago,” McConnell, R-Ky., said. “So I want to thank federal state and local leaders who are taking seriously the obligation to restore peace, protect the innocent and stop this senseless violence.” The Kentucky Republican, who is up for reelection to a sixth term this fall, called for the nation to unite not just against the killing of Floyd but also against those who are protesting violently. “Our nation is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing of Mr. Floyd. We are united,” McConnell reaffirmed. “It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace on our streets and peace in our community.” “We need to unite against these violent rioters who only seek to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing,” McConnell continued. Schumer also condemned violent protest methods but argued that while thousands of protesters have been detained, only one of the four police officers involved in Floyd’s killing has been arrested. “It does not excuse the violence in anyway but explains in part why so many Americans are angry,” Schumer said. “There is accountability for every day citizens and protesters when they break the law, but there isn’t always accountability for those in law enforcement when it does the same.” As the Senate leaders squabbled in the chamber, Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham announced he plans to hold a hearing on June 16 to examine the death of Floyd and police misconduct in the United States, promising to “take a deep dive” into the issue in two weeks. “The topic for the country is what to do after the death of Mr. Floyd, and what does the death of Mr. Floyd mean?” Graham, R-S.C., said at the outset of a hearing he chaired examining the country’s operation of its prisons during the coronavirus pandemic. “Well, it’s a long-overdue wake-up call to the country that there are too any of these cases where African American men die in police custody under fairly brutal circumstances. It’s clear to me that policing and among men in the African American community is a topic that needs to be discussed and acted upon, and I expect this committee to do its part.” Graham, who has often counted himself as one of the president’s top defenders and golfing buddies, said he has consulted with the panel’s ranking Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and they’ve penciled in June 16 for a hearing, adding that’s as “quick as we could do it.” “I’d like to get to the root cause of it. Mr. Floyd’s case is outrageous on its face, but I think it speaks to a broader issue,” Graham said in stark contrast to the president’s rhetoric on the turmoil. “We just need to get to the bottom of what happened and what we can do to fix it. And the answer is pretty obvious: Community policing is the anecdote to this, where there is a sense of community among the police and those that are being policed. I don’t know how to make that a reality but we’ll have a hearing along those lines.” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin lamented that “America still lives in the shadows of its original sin: slavery, and the racism that spawned it.” “Is our system of justice in America so infected by racism that it cannot function in a manner consistent with our democratic values? That’s as basic as it gets in a democratic society,” Durbin, D-Illinois, said. “Is our president mobilizing our military to suppress dissent in a manner inconsistent with the constitution and never seen before in history? That is a question that goes to the very heart of our democracy and our role as an equal branch of government.” Durbin urged Graham “not to overlook the fact” that those questions “really go to the heart of our democracy” — arguing that many other issues the committee plans to examine in the coming days are “irrelevant.” The committee has already scheduled oversight hearings with Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general, into Crossfire Hurricane, the code name for the counterintelligence investigation undertaken by the FBI in 2016 and 2017 into links between Trump associates and Russian officials, as well as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s notice and takedown process for copyright holders to get infringing user-uploaded material removed from websites. “What is relevant is the question as to how America can be safe and still hold to its democratic values and principles,” Durbin contended. Feinstein said the ongoing civil unrest across the country is “one of those horrible anomalies about life and when it happens it’s so graphic and so real and you can’t control it.” “There’s desperate need to bring people together to show the sameness among us, not to illustrate the badness,” Feinstein, D-Calif., said. “You had a police officer responsible for the death of a victim and people reacted, but now what has to happen, the message is clearly sent, what has to happen is we should take a look. We are going to holding hearings.” After days of protests, looting and a hardened police crackdown on the civil unrest, Feinstein said “the message has been transmitted.” “I think they want all of us to work to bring people together, to stop the division and to reform police practices wherever necessary to prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again,” she said. Senate Democrats are also introducing a resolution they will attempt to pass affirming the constitutional rights of Americans, while noting that “violence and looting are unlawful, unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of peaceful protests.” The measure, which is non-binding and unlikely to garner sufficient GOP support, explicitly condemns Trump “for ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against the Americans who were peaceably protesting in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC on the night of June 1, 2020, thereby violating the constitutional rights of those peaceful protestors.” Given the political divide in Washington, lawmakers expressed doubt that reforms can be achieved to satisfy the needs of the dark moment. “There’s time, but I don’t know if there’s a will, particularly among Republican leadership,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., bemoaned. On Antifa, Graham said he’s “sure there’s a part they play, and we’ll try to find out exactly how organized this violence is.” “Most protestors are out on the street to lend their voice for change and the rioting and the looting is not helping the cause at all and it’s got to come to an end,” Graham said.

In a call with President Donald Trump and governors on Monday — a recording of which was obtained by ABC News, Esper urged states “to dominate the battle space” so that civil unrest “dissipates and we can get back to the right normal.” Over the last week, thousands of Americans have peacefully protested systemic racial inequality sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. But looting and riots in many American cities have caused states to activate the National Guard to support law enforcement — with the president threatening to deploy the active duty military to quell the violence. Two retired four-star generals took the rare step of publicly condemning Esper’s comments on Monday, arguing the language was inappropriate to describe the current situation. Congrats to @EsperDoD for making his mark in history. Today he both ensured his name will be into countless future articles of how not to act in civil-military relations, and jumped much higher up the ranking list of worst Secretary of Defenses in history. https://t.co/sIX5pZcj43 — Peter W. Singer (@peterwsinger) June 1, 2020 “The ‘battle space’ of America???” tweeted ret. Army Gen. Tony Thomas, who led U.S. Special Operations Command. ” Not what America needs to hear…ever, unless we are invaded by an adversary or experience a constitutional failure…ie a Civil War…” Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed a similar sentiment, tweeting, “America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy.” America’s military, our sons and daughters, will place themselves at risk to protect their fellow citizens. Their job is unimaginably hard overseas; harder at home. Respect them, for they respect you. America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy. #BeBetter — GEN(R) Martin E. Dempsey (@Martin_Dempsey) June 1, 2020 Asked about Esper’s use of the term “battle space,” a senior defense official, who declined to be identified, told Pentagon reporters on Tuesday that the “DOD often communicates in a parlance unique to the profession of arms.” “He was using the terms that we have,” the official said. “Nothing should be read into the use of that term to denote anything other than it’s a common term to denote the area we are operating in.” Esper served 10 years in the U.S. Army on active duty and another 11 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve. A former senior administration official told ABC News that congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have privately expressed concerns about Esper’s words because they could be seen as laying the groundwork for the invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy active duty troops within the United States under limited circumstances. The president would have to invoke the act because the active duty military — unlike the National Guard — is barred from carrying out law enforcement activities under Posse Comitatus Act. On Tuesday, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called on Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley to testify before his committee next week to explain the role they envision the U.S. military playing in response to protests. He also told reporters that language like “battle space” is “deeply concerning in terms of how the U.S. military would be used for domestic law enforcement,” though he had not personally spoken to Esper about it. As of Tuesday, governors in 28 states and the District of Columbia had activated more than 20,400 National Guard members to assist state and local law enforcement operations, according to the National Guard. But overnight, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, along with active duty military police units from Fort Bragg, Fort Drum and Fort Riley, staged at Joint Base Andrews outside of the nation’s capital in case they were requested, according to two U.S. officials. “The decision to use active military forces in crowd control in the United States should only be made as a last resort,” said ABC News analyst Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. “The National Guard is fully capable and trained for these operations. They are from these communities and likely have been activated many times to support people after fires, hurricanes, or pandemics. Some of the people they helped are the ones protesting. Active Army and Marine Corps units are trained to fight our nation’s enemies, not their fellow Americans.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

Major indexes wavered through the morning then turned solidly higher late in the day. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%. The gains came despite spreading unrest in the U.S. as investors hope that the gradual lifting of lockdown provisions will help economies recover from the damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude oil rose again. Bond yields rose, another sign that pessimism is ebbing. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: U.S. stock indexes are moving broadly higher in afternoon trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.3%. Industrial, technology, financial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Communication services stocks and household goods makers lagged. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 112 points, or 0.5%, to 25,590. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, was flat after having been down 0.8% in the early going. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.9%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 jumped 2% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany’s DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets’ gains and surged 3.7%. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Tokyo had 34 new confirmed cases Tuesday. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Even so, Wall Street is betting that the U.S. government and others will not move to close the economy again even if there is a pickup in new cases. “There’s just a lack of appetite for a potential re-shutdown in the event that the virus accelerates from here,” Hainlin said. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.68% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery was up 3.8% to $36.78 a barrel. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 3.3% to $39.58 a barrel.",0.0
1623643133,2020-06-02 17:00:03,Barr vows 'even greater' law enforcement resources in unrest,http://www.journalgazette.net/news/us/20200602/barr-vows-even-greater-law-enforcement-resources-in-unrest,en,False,,29459,journalgazette.net,http://www.journalgazette.net#spider,"WASHINGTON – U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation's capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. ""The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, ""We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ------ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

(WEHT)- The Evansville Police Department says a group of people tried to riot inside an east side Walmart Monday. Police report they became aware of the plans following a Facebook video that allegedly showed several people discussing their plans to riot at the store. A short time later, both the video and the account that posted it were deleted before detectives could save the video. While conducting surveillance at the Walmart, police spotted a live video on Facebook that reportedly showed David Casimir trying to recruit others to join in the riot. Police say Casimir operates an account that was tagged in the first Facebook video. After seeing the officers in the parking lot, Casimir reportedly discussed moving the riot to another Walmart to avoid detection from the police. Casimir, along with Ketia Lapointe and Redlher Joseph, entered the Walmart, where they were detained before being able to destroy or harm anyone or anything. Police say Lapointe tried to break away from the officers and all three began shouting as they walked to the back of the store. A Walmart asset protection officer told police Casimir was a suspect in a previous criminal mischief incident where store property was damaged but fled from the store before officers arrived. Lapointe, Casimir, and Joseph were barred from all Walmart locations. All three face preliminary charges of attempted rioting and disorderly conduct, and Lapointe faces an additional charge of resisting law enforcement. Both Joseph and Casimir are from Evansville while Lapointe is from Orlando, Florida.

(WANE) — Hundreds of protesters have gathered in downtown Fort Wayne over the past few days. But when protests turned destructive, restoration companies like Protechs Inc. were called in to help replace broken doors and windows. Protechs Inc. is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so Protechs Operations Manager Bruce Adams said it’s not uncommon to receive calls about boarding up businesses. But Friday and Saturday night was a first, he said. “The shock at first was when we were called out to do some of this, there was still a lot of activity downtown,” Adams said. “You are trying to put boards on and cut wood, it’s dark already, and now you have tear gas flying around. You don’t know what people are doing and obviously you got your back to the street and you are trying to secure these properties. It can be very stressful.” Friday night, crews were busy boarding up broken windows. Then on Saturday and Sunday, crews came back to board up remaining windows and doors on some businesses as a precaution. “Boarding up the properties in the grand scheme of things is less costly than turning around and trying to replace equipment, or materials or products,” Adams said. “Storefronts and framing is very expensive. When you get down the storefront glass and all that can be very costly.” Adams said that he stands behind the protest and its message, but damaging buildings and properties should not be a part of it. Adams said he would rather have peaceful protests that don’t result in damage. “We have a business doing things from regular catastrophes like houses flooding, wind damage to houses, and fires,” Adams said. “All these things we try to do to help out, its counterproductive to what we are doing and something they need to understand is that we are all in it together. This is our community and we need to stand together and do this in the correct way.”",0.0

Northam is among governors from New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware who have turned down requests from Defense Secretary Mark Esper to offer National Guard troops to help with security in Washington, DC. By Ryan Nobles, Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne, CNN (CNN) -- Democratic governors in Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware turned down requests from Defense Secretary Mark Esper to offer National Guard troops to help with security in Washington, DC. In some instances, the Defense Department was counting on troop support from those states before the governors intervened. ""I can confirm that personnel from the NY National Guard were expected to move to DC last night, but permission was withdrawn by the governor,"" Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesman, said Tuesday morning. During his daily press briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that New York's National Guard was completely focused on the state. ""I don't know what requests they've gotten, but I can tell you this, I wouldn't grant any request to send National Guard out of the state at this time because I want them in this state in case we need them,"" Cuomo said.?? Another Pentagon official told CNN that support was expected from Delaware as well, but troops were diverted to Wilmington. CNN has reached out to Delaware Gov. John Carney's office for comment. In Virginia, an official with a direct knowledge of the deliberations said Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, made the decision not to send troops after consulting with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser and her office. Boswer's team told Virginia officials that they had not requested any additional assistance. On CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday morning, Bowser confirmed her office had nothing to do with any request for help. ""We didn't request any assistance, DC police did not request any assistance from our neighbors,"" Bowser said. ""And we do have throughout the national capital region arrangements to assist each other if we -- if there is ever a mass event that requires additional policing. We haven't taken the step of requesting that assistance from around our region. And we haven't requested assistance from other states."" In addition to being concerned about needing the troops in his own state to deal with violence in Virginia cities, Northam was also concerned about contributing to the response in Washington after President Donald Trump's call with governors on Monday, in which he lambasted them over what he said were insufficient responses to unrest in the wake of George Floyd's death. ""When it became clear that our troops would be under the command of the attorney general and not Mayor Bowser, we decided that it was not in our best interest to take part,"" the Virginia government official said. ""The call with governors made it clear that the President was interested in escalating the situation and the governor did not think that was responsible."" Pennsylvania state officials also confirmed that they, too, turned down the request out of concern for the need of troops to deal with issues in their state. ""Pennsylvania did receive this request. The National Guard currently has significant resources deployed across Pennsylvania. Their current priority is assisting commonwealth municipalities in their response to de-escalate violence and keep our communities safe,"" said Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf. On Monday, Trump intensified his rhetoric about using military forces to ""dominate"" protesters and wished aloud there was an ""occupying force"" in cities across America during a call with governors where he urged a tougher response to protests. Later, law enforcement officers fired what appeared to eyewitness accounts to be rubber bullets at a peaceful crowd outside the White House and smoke filled the air. A spokesman for the Pentagon told CNN Tuesday the National Guard did not fire tear gas or rubber bullets. A group comprised of service members who hold civilian jobs and train part-time, the National Guard are usually deployed in their home states by governors or the federal government who decide the length of each mission. They can perform law enforcement actions when under the command of state governors unlike the active military, which is forbidden by law from doing so unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act.

By Madeline Holcombe, Eric Levenson and Steve Almasy, CNN (CNN) -- They marched by the thousands in Houston. They called for a better America in Los Angeles. They sat in the streets in Chicago and in silence in St. Paul. Protests continued Tuesday for an eighth night across the United States, with demonstrators peacefully gathering to shout George Floyd's name and to call for justice in the wake of his death at the hands of a now-jailed former police officer. Several cities re-established curfews for Tuesday night in an attempt to stop the after-hours violence and looting of businesses. Minneapolis, where Floyd died, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington DC, are among the cities with curfews. The New York Police Department had arrested about 40 people as of 10 p.m. a number expected to increase, a law enforcement official told CNN. In Atlanta, a protest was calm but after 9 p.m. police and National Guard began to sweep the streets to clear them. A CNN crew saw tear gas being used. Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, said they used chemical agents to disperse a crowd after ""being assaulted with bottles, rocks, and chemical agents."" One person was arrested there and police later tweeted that a protester with a rifle was also taken into custody. Many of the protests began in the afternoon and lasted hours. Earlier in Houston, where a public memorial for George Floyd will take place next week, tens of thousands of people marched to City Hall to shout his name and call for justice after his death. The marchers, who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" and ""Peace on the left, justice on the right,"" walked or rode horses from Discovery Green park toward their destination, where organizers were scheduled to speak. George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, addressed the crowd asking for a peaceful protest. He told them to be steadfast in the quest for police reform. ""We're trying to break the cycle right now. We got this,"" he said. There were protests in at least a dozen US cities. ""We want peace,"" Joseph Haynes, a demonstrator in Los Angeles, told CNN's Kyung Lah. ""Look at all these wonderful people out here. Look at us. And this is not just black people."" Haynes also stopped to talk with a police officer to show solidarity with them and not a ""system that has oppressed people for hundreds of years,"" he said. About 24 hours after people were forcibly moved from a street within view of the White House, even more protesters gathered and stayed even as the 7 p.m. curfew in DC passed. In New York the curfew was moved from 11 p.m., which it was on Monday, to 8 p.m. ""We will not tolerate violence of any kind,"" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said the curfew will remain for the rest of the week. ""We will not tolerate attacks on police officers. We will not tolerate hatred being created."" The mayor urged New Yorkers to protest ""in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do this evening to keep a peaceful city."" Declining to go into numbers, a senior NYPD official told CNN that there will be ""enhanced deployment"" tonight. ""The goal is to minimize risk to the public and maximize efficient use of resources,"" the official said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office said Monday the number of NYPD officers on the street would double from 4,000 to 8,000. State opens investigation into Minneapolis police The Minnesota Department of Human Rights is launching a civil rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, Gov. Tim Walz announced. The investigation will look into practices of the department for the last 10 years, he said. A news release says the inquiry will try to determine whether police engaged in ""systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped."" The department's Commissioner Rebecca Lucero will lead the investigation. She filed a civil rights charge Monday against the department, alleging Floyd's death was in violation of the state's Human Rights Act. Floyd, 46, died last week after Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes, according to a prosecutor's statement of probable cause. His final words included ""Mama"" and ""I can't breathe."" Three other officers who responded to the scene, two of whom helped restrain Floyd, were fired by the police chief, who said they were ""complicit"" in his death. They have not been charged with wrongdoing despite calls from the Floyd family and protesters. On Monday, two different autopsies found that Floyd's death was a homicide. A public memorial service will be held for Floyd in Minneapolis on Thursday, according to a statement from National Action Network. Officers shot and hit by vehicles Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd spoke to those gathered in support of his brother Monday, delivering a simple message for those committing violence. ""He would not want y'all to be doing this,"" he said. Not everyone got the message. In St. Louis, four officers were struck by gunfire during protests. Their injuries are non-life-threatening, Chief John Hayden Jr. said. Las Vegas police are investigating two officer-involved shootings overnight, one in which an officer was shot, police told CNN affiliate KVVU-TV. In Buffalo, New York, three law enforcement officers clearing the scene of a protest were injured when an SUV drove through a police blockade, New York State police said in a news release. One of the more serious incidents happened in New York City, where a sergeant was hit by a car with such force that the officer flipped sideways in the air. The officer is in serious but stable condition with leg and head injuries, NYPD Lt. Thomas Antonetti said. The driver fled the scene. There were about 700 arrests in New York City on Monday night for looting and other offenses, including attacks on officers, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said. Late Monday night, some looters in midtown Manhattan appeared to be remarkably organized at times, CNN correspondent Shimon Prokupecz said. ""They would go to stores. They would break the windows. You know, they would use hammers. They would run off. And then, others would come. And then, repeatedly come back,"" he said. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He said he didn’t expect it to happen to his store because people in the area know him, and that he’s the only black business owner in the posh Buckhead shopping center. Dias said he supports the demonstrations over the killing of Floyd, but added, “We have people protesting, and we have people who just want to vandalize. It’s two different things.” “The people who came to vandalize my store, they weren’t protesting anything, and it’s not the way to protest,” he said. “You can protest peacefully, but there is a little group that is trying to take advantage of everything that’s happening right now. “It’s not the same. The people protesting and the people doing all this crazy stuff is not the same.” Dias said he was under immense financial pressure to reopen after being closed for about three months because of COVID-19. “We planned to open on Monday, and then they broke [into] the store on Friday,” he said. Dias said right now it’s looking like he’ll have to close, as he’s still behind on rent from when the store was recently closed. But he’s not giving up hope, trying to raise funds to reopen via a GoFundMe page. He said that while he has insurance “it doesn’t cover everything.” “I’m with the people protesting, but don’t be confused, because like I said there are people that are just trying to take advantage,” he said. ‘I’m ready to rage, I’m ready to protest, but I want to do it the right way’ Kris Shelby, the general manager and curator at Attom, said that he’d been following the protests on Friday, but “the last thing on my mind was, are they going to start looting.” He lives in an apartment with a view of the store, and said he saw a bunch of cars start pulling into the shopping center after midnight on Friday. “I’m just hearing glass break … I hear people screaming and yelling,” he said. “And then I hear gunshots.” He said he immediately wanted to go try to protect the store, but was worried about his safety “or me hurting someone else.” Shelby said he didn’t sleep that night and when he walked to the store early the next morning “everything was gone.” “I understand what’s going on in our world right now — I am a young black male who has been dealing with police since I was at a young age,” he said. “I’ve been dealing with that my entire life and having the fear of the police, it sucks.” “I’m mad, I’m pissed, I’m ready to rage, I’m ready to protest, but I want to do it the right way,” he added. “I’m out here because I want to see a change and make a difference, I’m not here because I want to tear down the city. I’m here to build up our community.” Shelby’s been at the store since the first day it opened in 2016, and said it’s always strived to be a part of the community. “People just come hang out with us at Attoms shop, so that’s why I didn’t think that was going to happen to us,” he said. “We’ve shown nothing but love to the city of Atlanta, and we’ve helped a lot of local designers.” He said he strongly supports the protests, but that looting “isn’t going solve anything.” “Go out there and protest, do what’s right, try to get your voices heard,” he said. “But going out and looting isn’t going to solve anything at all, the only thing that is going to do is set us back, because you are tearing down the places that we live at. You all live in this city as well.” If there was one message he would give to his community right now, Shelby said it would be to “beat the system” by voting. “When it’s time for us to vote, we need everybody out there at the voters poll so we can have a better world,” Shelby said. “I’m sick and tired. I just want to go to living a regular life where it doesn’t matter what race you are, we can all live in this world together.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

The news comes amid mounting reports of disinformation being spread online amid the protests over the killing of George Floyd. The account, with the handle @ANTIFA_US, was traced back to be a false facade for the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. It was specifically called out by U.S. law enforcement as an example of a left-wing radical group attempting to incite violence amid the unrest and nationwide protests. “This account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. We took action after the account sent a Tweet inciting violence and broke the Twitter Rules,” a Twitter spokesperson told ABC News. Donald Trump Jr. even referenced the bogus account before it was taken down, calling it a “terrorist organization” and tweeting, “They’re not even pretending anymore.” Twitter has taken action on other fake accounts linked to Identity Europa. The accounts were engaged in hateful conduct focused on issues of race, religion and sexual orientation. Before the fake Antifa account was suspended, it drew significant media attention for a tweet that incited violence, according to Twitter. Antifa — short for “anti-fascists” — is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, as the protests over Floyd’s death continue to roil the nation, social media has become ripe with disinformation. “Time and time again we have seen public figures, media personalities and even government officials amplifying disinformation and extremist rhetoric intended to inspire violence,” John Cohen, a former senior Department of Homeland Security official and current ABC News contributor, said. “A great step in deescalating the violence currently facing the Nation would be for this to end.” Twitter said it is also actively investigating the hashtag #dcblackout and have suspended hundreds of “spammy accounts” that were using it on Monday. The hashtag first started trending on Monday morning. Twitter users posted about an internet blackout in Washington, D.C., and a cover-up attempt to silence protesters via the hashtag. Internet monitor NetBlocks said, however, there was no indication of mass-scale internet disruption in the nation’s capital in the last 48 hours. As disinformation spread about the internet blackout, a counter-narrative was also apparently being boosted by bots alerting people that the #dcblackout was “misinformation.” It appears the goal of these efforts was to sow confusion and fear. “Our teams have been taking action proactively on any coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation around this issue,” a Twitter spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the National Capital Region Threat Intelligence Consortium issued an alert Monday, saying that in the last 24 hours unknown entities have been spreading disinformation in order to fuel violence amid the ongoing protests and unrest. “Late Sunday night, May 31, 2020, social media reports began to surface claiming that protesters ‘broke into’ the White House, gun shots around the area were heard, and that President Trump and his family fled to Kansas,” the alert stated. The alerted added that the Twitter post featured a video with a large group of people running up steps toward a building with white columns. “However, this video did not feature the White House, but appeared to be filmed in front of the steps of the State House in Columbus, Ohio,” it added. “Multiple Twitter accounts, some of which appeared to behave in a bot-like manner and featured Arabic writing on their profiles, began to retweet this video, perpetuating the spread of disinformation. Some Twitter users recognized the building featured in the video and attempted to correct the narrative.” The analysts also wrote about the #dcblackout hashtag, saying a number of “legitimate and bot-controlled accounts retweeted this message.” The actors behind the social media campaign remain unknown, “but the intent of the messaging appears to be an attempt to instill fear and cause confusion among the populace,” according to the alert. A report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington field office analyzing the impact of the demonstrations in the D.C. area found online messages calling for attacks on places including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee headquarters in D.C. and Federal Reserve banks across the country. Fake videos have also been distributed online that purportedly showed D.C. cops shooting black people and bogus messages willing to pay people to be “professional anarchists,” according to the FBI report. Even though President Donald Trump and other senior officials insist that law enforcement’s concerns are confined to agitators on the political left, the FBI report states that “some militia members issued calls to travel to participate in the demonstrations, as part of their anti-law enforcement and anti-government agenda.” ABC News’ James Meek, Daniel Linden and Lucien Bruggeman contributed to this report.

French authorities banned the protest over racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Family and friends of Adama Traore, a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016, call for a protest which will also pay homage to George Floyd. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) PARIS (AP) — Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd’s death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Several thousand people defied a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading “Restaurant Open” — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting “I can’t breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia’s largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. “This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,” Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, “all blacks live this to a degree.” Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city’s frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here.” Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him, and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States,” he said. “But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.” ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

The curfew begins Tuesday and applies to all public streets and public places, which the city says includes “any place, whether on privately or publicly owned property, that is accessible and open to the general public. This includes, but is not limited to, streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks, plazas, parking lots, parking garages, and vacant lots.” The executive order said the city received threats on social media and had information that the protests in Indianapolis, “which resulted in extensive damage and loss of life,” would spread to Carmel “on or about June 1, 2020 through June 7, 2020.” “We have received threats directed toward our community and we cannot ignore their implications,” Carmel Police Chief Jim Barlow said in a statement from the city. The mayor on Monday issued a Disaster Emergency Declaration. A news release said, “This was done to enable the city to take swift action against the threat of civil unrest should it need to do so.” The declaration came shortly after a peaceful protest Monday along the Monon Greenway. Protesters also walked through the Carmel Arts & Design District. Brainard on Monday also announced then later put on hold a plan to sue Minneapolis for negligence so the Hamilton County city could recover expenses for protecting itself as a result of police actions in Minnesota. The curfew includes these exceptions: Law-enforcement, fire, medical and other public safety personnel. Members of the news media.

New York St., on June 2, 2020, in Indianapolis. (WISH Photo) INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Downtown salons are faced with yet another hurdle as they try to open after riots this weekend left behind widespread damage. Salons in Indianapolis were closed for months due to COVID-19. With their opening date already pushed back to June 1 after assessing the damage from riots over the weekend many wondered if they would have to push that opening date yet again or if they’d be able to open at all. Red’s Barber Shop on Washington Street near Monument Circle is unrecognizable from the outside after suffering severe damage from the weekend’s riots. “When I first got in here our windows were completely blown out all our equipment and everything was all thrown out on the floor. Just kind of the place was ransacked,” said William Hogg, manager of Red’s Classic Barber Shop Co., 22 E. Washington St. People stole masks and equipment but Hogg said they spent most of the weekend cleaning up from the mess that was made as people ran through. “By the mirrors not being broken into and the chairs being together kind of helped the infrastructure of the barbershop stay together and was able to help us open up this morning,” said Hogg. “Soon as I walked in here and started looking around, I said there is no way we are opening up on Tuesday,” Hogg said. For Red’s not opening would have done more than hurt business. “I believe that if we wouldn’t have been able to open today a lot of us would be completely out of work,” said Hogg. The operators of Commissary Barber & Barista, 304 E. New York St., say they spent most of Saturday night helping protesters by providing resources to combat the tear gas and pepper balls. After the store operators left, the business was damaged despite its “Black Lives Matter” sign in the window. “They broke into the door, got to the first station, grabbed $800 worth of barbering supplies and then left,” said Brandon Burdine, owner of Commissary Barber & Barista. For these businesses, closing for three months was hard enough. Those that got more severe damage started to question if they’d be able to open at all. Burdine says he doesn’t want to see any more fires or damage to businesses. He is encouraging more peaceful protests through the streets. “It is a bummer. It sucks to see the city destroyed. It sucks to see everything vandalized but just something has to happen obviously. So if this does something and makes people rethink their stance on racism or anything like that, then maybe it will work. I don’t know,” Burdine said. Some salons and barber shops in downtown Indianapolis were unable to reopen due to riot damage. Also, many downtown salons and other businesses that were not damaged boarded up their windows as a precaution.

But other than a few moments when things did get a bit chaotic I think for the most part they’ve done their best at keeping the peace.” IMPD recorded at least one hundred Use of Force incidents over four days from the simple handcuffing of arrestees to the deployment of pepper balls to break up crowds. “I really have no context in which I would be able to make a judgment as to whether a hundred is where we ought to be in terms of the numbers of Use of Force incidents,” said Hogsett a day after he directed IMPD Chief Randy Taylor to review the actions of officers amid complaints of protestors. “We marched down that street on Saturday and they cut us off and immediately gassed us with no warning,” said Malik Muhammad who marched on the Governor’s Residence Monday night.“They maced a disabled kid while he was on his knees. It was disgusting.” Taylor apologized to anyone who inadvertently suffered the effects of tear gas over the weekend. Deputy Chief Josh Barker said while the mayor’s call for internal reviews of IMPD actions would not change the tactics of officers, he would remind the men and women under his command to be judicious in their use of force. Hogsett said that social media and other videos brought to his attention resulted in the directive for an IMPD internal review. “I think there are aspects of some of the videos that I saw that are concerning and disturbing. But I can’t make judgments on the basis of that.” On Saturday the mayor blamed “few” of those in the protest crowd for causing the widespread damages during the first night of rioting to shops, restaurants and Circle Centre Mall. His characterization of “moments of chaos” on Saturday night alone went on for five hours and resulted in two downtown murders. The widespread unrest was finally quelled Sunday evening with the first of three overnight curfews and the deployment of Indiana National Guard troops and Indiana State troopers to protect state property downtown. The mayor said he considered calling a curfew for Saturday night, but was “hopeful” that rally leaders could convince protestors to leave downtown by seven p.m. Many did. Many did not. More arrived as darkness fell. “I think I would want the people of Indianapolis to understand that first and foremost we have an obligation to do everything we can to protect all residents of the city of Indianapolis including peaceful protestors,” said Hogsett, the day after an IMPD officer defused a tense confrontation between protestors and state troopers outside the Governor’s Residence on North Meridian Street. “I want to thank both those peaceful protestors and the law enforcement officials who are dedicated to protecting and serving us for making what would have otherwise been a very difficult situation, perhaps even a violent confrontation, one of really peace and harmony and brotherhood.” One of the mayor’s and IMPD’s foremost public supporters was not happy with what he perceived to be Hogsett’s less-than-enthusiastic support and appreciation of the job police officers did in restoring order to the city. “I think it looks like a warzone,” said Dr. Chris Holland of The Father’s House as he surveyed downtown Indianapolis. “I think the questions that any intelligent citizen would ask is if you can call for a curfew on Sunday why couldn’t you call for a curfew on Saturday? “If I were a business owner downtown, if I were a citizen that lived downtown, I would be majorly asking some questions about whose final decision is it? I know we can pass the buck so to speak and push it down, but should you push it down to the men and women who were putting their life on the line?” Dr. Holland and his church and volunteers have distributed thousands of medical triage kits to public safety officers throughout the metro area so that they may treat accident and violence victims who might not live long enough for an ambulance to arrive. “I love Mayor Hogsett. I’ve walked these streets with Mayor Hogsett,” said the pastor. “You can’t have it both ways. You can’t say, ‘I’m the leader, I’m leading public safety,’ and yet disappear in one of the most I mean violent moments of our city’s history.” Hogsett repeated the account of a woman who was committing vandalism but whose life was saved by an officer during the first night of rioting. “The one story that was reported, and I think speaks volumes about the efforts that IMPD are making, is there was an instance where an individual, who apparently was kicking in a window, severely severed, the result of a shard of glass, severely severed parts of her leg so badly that had a police officer not been present to immediately implemented a tourniquet and the doctor in the ER room said that saved her life.” That tourniquet was possibly supplied with the triage kit donated by Dr. Holland’s church and supporters.",0.0

The evidence is a video, which appeared to be recorded in the moments following following Reed's death on May 6, that attorneys shared with IndyStar columnist Suzette Hackney. The video does not capture the shooting but records the voices of three women describing what they say they had witnessed while driving near the area of W. 62nd Street and Michigan Road. ""They killed this man for no reason. Shot this man in his back,"" says the woman who is recording the video. ""Dude was running, dude was running."" ""I thought they Tased him (because) the way his body was trembling so bad,"" another woman says. ""He was on the ground shaking. They still shot this man,"" the first woman says. ""After they Tased him, he was on the ground defenseless. Dude couldn't do nothing and they shot him."" The woman recording the video said she, her mother and her sister all witnessed the shooting. She also referenced two other people who saw it, too. None of them are identified in the video or by the attorney in a brief press release issued Tuesday. Attempts to reach the Law Firm of Fatima Johnson by an IndyStar reporter were unsuccessful Tuesday. It does not appear that the women have been interviewed by investigators. In a statement quoted in Hackney's column, IMPD Deputy Chief Craig McCartt said ""no one has come forward"" in response to IMPD's request that witnesses provide statements about what they saw. ""And as recently as last week, IMPD investigators were in contact with attorneys for the Reed family and were not made aware of such witnesses or evidence. We continue to implore anyone with information on this incident to step forward by calling the Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 317-262-TIPS,"" said McCartt, who oversees the investigations division. An IndyStar reporter has requested statements from the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police and Indy10 Black Lives Matter. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears, citing a conflict of interest, asked the court on May 8 to assign a special prosecutor. No appointment has been announced in the ensuing three weeks. Mayor Joe Hogsett's administration has noted that the office has no involvement in an IMPD criminal investigation, although Hogsett requested that the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office monitor the investigation. ""As the criminal investigation into the death of Mr. Reed continues, with monitoring from federal authorities at our request, it is my hope that a special prosecutor will be appointed by the court as quickly as possible,"" he said in a statement to IndyStar early Tuesday evening. ""It has been weeks since the Marion County Prosecutor's Office declined to review this investigation, and our community rightly demands and deserves the naming of a special prosecutor to lead the investigation, release information when appropriate, and reach a conclusion that will be conveyed to our community swiftly and transparently."" The prospect of new eyewitnesses potentially providing first-hand accounts would mark a noteworthy turn in the case. Investigations into many fatal police shootings typically contain little video evidence or witness testimony, effectively leaving it to investigators to piece together a case that largely rests on a police officer's version of events. Until now, most public information about the police shooting of Reed has been shared by IMPD leadership. The command staff have said a police officer, who Chief Randal Taylor has declined to identify, unsuccessfully attempted to use a stun gun on Reed before an exchange of gunfire. A handgun recovered at the scene matched one found on pictures on Reed's social media, IMPD said, and the gun had been fired at least once at the scene. The Law Firm of Fatima Johnson, which is representing Reed's family, said in a press release that eyewitnesses disagree with IMPD's characterization of what happened. ""After it was announced that (the firm) would ensure that pro bono attorneys would represent eyewitnesses who were afraid to come forward, motorists who were stopped on the street where Mr. Reed was shot were able to speak to Mr. Reed's family's attorneys,"" the press release says. ""Every witness that spoke with Mr. Reed's family's attorneys has disputed that Mr. Reed brandished a weapon or shot a gun before he was shot to death. Mr. Reed's family is committed to fighting for the truth about what happened that fateful day."" In the video, the women said they were picking up food when they saw the shooting occur. As they drove past a nearby Indianapolis Public Library branch, the women tried to record a visual of the vehicle driven by Reed, and they described seeing people start hanging yellow crime-scene tape near his body. It is unclear whether the women say anything about Reed carrying or firing a gun. At one point, a woman references someone ""yanking a gun back"" but it's unclear if she is referencing Reed or the police officer. At times, as multiple women are speaking at once, it is difficult to understand every word they say in the recording. The other known evidence is a Facebook Live recorded by Reed. The video showed Reed speeding away from a police chase before parking in the area of 62nd and Michigan. Then, as Reed began running, he appears to be shot by something in the back, leading him to either collapse or drop his phone or both. Then more than a dozen pops, likely gunshots, can be heard. Local activists have wondered whether the nearby Indianapolis Public Library branch would have security cameras that recorded video, too, but IMPD declined to tell IndyStar on May 7 whether such video footage exists. IMPD also has declined to answer an IndyStar question asking whether Reed was legally allowed to carry his handgun publicly. IMPD has largely rejected questions until Marion Superior Court assigns a special prosecutor. The revelation of another video comes as hundreds of protesters have flooded Indianapolis streets in recent days after 46-year-old George Floyd died in the custody of Minneapolis police. A video showed a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes while Floyd, handcuffed, said he could not breathe. Floyd's death helped ignite days of protests and unrest in several cities across the country. In Indianapolis, protests began the night of Reed's shooting and continued for several days. New demonstrations organized by Indy10 Black Lives Matter and other local activists, following the death of Floyd, have attracted several hundred people to Monument Circle, the Indiana War Memorial and numerous other locations Downtown, where protesters have chanted the names of Floyd as well as Reed and other black residents who have died as a result of IMPD officer's use of force. Widespread peaceful demonstrations against the police, which have not swelled to this level in Indianapolis in at least 30 years, were followed by chaotic riots on Friday and Saturday nights, the latter of which saw two fatal shootings. Downtown businesses were busted into, looted or set ablaze while tear gas clouded Lady Victory atop the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Much of the unrest quelled Sunday night as Mayor Joe Hogsett announced a curfew. It remained quiet, for the most part, through a second curfew on Monday. Hogsett announced a curfew of 9 p.m. Tuesday through 6 a.m. Wednesday. Whether the third curfew will again maintain calm remains to be seen. The new video could spark another wave of discontent.

I’ve walked these streets with Mayor Hogsett,” said the pastor. “You can’t have it both ways. You can’t say, ‘I’m the leader, I’m leading public safety,’ and yet disappear in one of the most I mean violent moments of our city’s history.” Hogsett repeated the account of a woman who was committing vandalism but whose life was saved by an officer during the first night of rioting. “The one story that was reported, and I think speaks volumes about the efforts that IMPD are making, is there was an instance where an individual, who apparently was kicking in a window, severely severed, the result of a shard of glass, severely severed parts of her leg so badly that had a police officer not been present to immediately implemented a tourniquet and the doctor in the ER room said that saved her life.” That tourniquet was possibly supplied with the triage kit donated by Dr. Holland’s church and supporters.",0.0

Karen Bass, D-Calif., the chair of the caucus, told ABC News. A federal chokehold ban, a review of police training standards and a reform of the legal doctrine that shields police officers from legal liability are some of the proposals circulating among the group, which House Democratic leaders have tasked with leading the chamber’s response to Floyd’s death and the ongoing protests. “We are going to do everything we can, while the nation has a height of awareness on the issue, to pass transformative legislation,” said Bass. “We want to make sure that, in this time period, we are very visible so that African Americans around the country understand that this is our experience as well.” Republicans and Democrats have been united in condemning the events leading up to Floyd’s death, but any broad and rapid compromise on policing reforms are unlikely on Capitol Hill — particularly in an election year when lawmakers are already struggling to agree on how to address the ongoing coronavirus and economic crisis. Still, the caucus hopes to use the moment to promote new ideas for policing reform, as well as proposals that have stalled in committee and previous sessions of Congress. The effort could also lead to action in 2021 depending on the results of the presidential election. “Of course it is a responsibility of all of us to take the time to heal. But we are looking to them for their values-based, sad experience, and their leadership in terms of legislation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said of the caucus on Tuesday. Former vice president Joe Biden on Tuesday endorsed a federal police chokehold ban from Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., calling it a “down payment on what is long overdue.” Jeffries first proposed the measure in 2015 after the death of Eric Garner. The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the topic in September 2019, but the proposal has yet to advance out of committee. On Monday, Sen. Cory Booker D-N.J., along with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called for reforming the federal statute governing police misconduct and the qualified immunity legal doctrine, which has been used to shield police officers and other government officials from some lawsuits. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a senior member of the caucus, plans to reintroduce the Law Enforcement Trust Integrity Act of 2015, a measure that would overhaul police training standards and incentivize oversight and accountability reforms. Beyond the caucus, Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, said he planned to introduce a bill to end qualified immunity and allow victims of excessive police force to sue officers in court, a proposal also backed by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. “All of us want to get at the root causes of the lack of police accountability and want to be able to hold police accountable in court for their misconduct,” Bass told ABC News, adding that lawmakers want to “end the careers of abusive officers” and prevent fired officers accused of using excessive force from being hired by other police departments. While Republicans have supported plans for police brutality hearings and condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd’s death, some have also called for more attention to the outbreaks of violence and looting amid the largely peaceful protests across the country. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the former ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler that his committee should look into anti-facist ‘antifa’ protestors and their activities in addition to any examination of police brutality. Nadler plans to hold a hearing on new criminal justice proposals and police brutality as soon as next week, according to aides. In the Senate, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has pledged to hold a hearing on policing and use of force, while Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, plans to push to end a Pentagon program to transfer military equipment to American police departments, a move endorsed by a top aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. on Twitter. Bass predicted that the House will have legislation ready for passage by the end of the month, when the chamber is expected to return to Washington for votes. “This is a unique time that is allowing us to come together because the people are angry,” said Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, a member of the caucus who was pepper-sprayed at a protest in Columbus, Ohio, over the weekend, “They’re crying out for answers.” Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio.

Yet again we are appalled at the violent death of an unarmed Black man at the hands of police. This has happened all too often in our land; a land that we declare is grounded in justice for all. I extend my prayers and concern for the family and community of Mr. George Floyd and for the repose of his soul. The violence that led to his death was filmed for all to see and sadly looks all too familiar. As noted by Archbishop José H. Gomez, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mr. Floyd’s death was “senseless and brutal.” I implore all to heed the calls for an end to the violence that has followed this tragedy. Peaceful demonstrators and protestors have a proper and positive place in our society. It is urgent that our communities’ leaders listen and commit themselves to concrete actions to right the injustices that racism breeds; the most noteworthy among these being violence toward people of color. The violence in American cities in recent days is self-destructive and self-defeating. No good can come from violence and destruction. I add my voice to the voices of law enforcement professionals calling for justice. They are rightly ashamed and saddened by recent events. I believe that the vast majority of police men and women desire to serve and protect, and are to be commended for their generous service. Let us as communities and as a nation now listen to the cries of those burdened every day by the sinful effects of racism. Together we can still build a more just society that will assure life, liberty, and equality for all.",0.0

He didn't understand. Thompson did so in protest of the NCAA's academic eligibility standards. The body had just voted to enact a minimum test score for a freshman to qualify for a scholarship under Proposition 48 — legislation that would disproportionately impact black athletes. Painter grew up in Muncie and went to a predominantly white high school. He didn't know how to look at things that way. ""And I was like, well what’s he doing that for?"" the Purdue coach said on the Jeff Goodman Basketball Podcast. ""This is the same for everybody. And then once I started digging into it, it’s not the same for everybody, because then everybody started to raise the same point. When you’re from a lower socioeconomic background, whether you’re white or black, you have less resources to be successful. That’s a fact. ""So if you grow up in an inner city, and inner cities are predominantly black, and inner cities have less resources, and now you’re supposed to take a test and that’s supposed to gauge whether you get college admission, admitted into college or not, so you can play basketball and use that game as a vehicle, like we’ve all used it as a positive vehicle, and now you’re limiting or stopping these people’s chances that are in this position. They’ve worked hard basketball-wise but now they don’t have a chance because they’re from a lower socioeconomic background and they don’t have a test score?"" Painter participated in a panel of coaches and athletic directors on their reactions to the violent death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. He also released a statement Saturday saying he wants to be part of the solution. His childhood naiveté is long gone. ""When Big John walked off. I’m like, well what’s he walking off for?"" Painter said. ""Well, they all should’ve walked off. They all should’ve kept walking, because it’s not fair. To this day, we still have those tests and they’re not fair to people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who don’t have those resources."" For much of his career as a coach, Painter has felt uncomfortable addressing hot-button topics, not wanting to anger people behind the scenes or rock the boat. In the past two or three years, he said, that's changed. ""You gotta protect your own guys,"" Painter said. ""You’re always wanting to protect them but systematic racism is everywhere. That’s everywhere. And there’s some things that when you’re growing up, you’re not used to. ""I was naive that way.""",0.0

One of those statues, right here in the Tri-State. A petition is circulating online to remove a confederate soldier statue in front of the Old Courthouse in Downtown Madisonville. The statue was erected in 1908 and depicts a soldier overlooking the town. But for some, the piece is unsettling. “I’ve disliked the statue for a long time,” says Steve Cox, created online petition. “I look at it as a symbol of hate.” Madisonville resident Steve Cox says he started the petition just days ago. The petition, Cox says, was geared towards city officials. “Personally I like it to be torn down,” says Cox. “I don’t care what happens to it. If that was sort of a compromise that would have to be made, that would have to be moved, that would be perfectly fine.” “If we really want to make our communities better, we have to look at it for what it is, and if changes need to be made, we need to focus on those changes,” says Bill McReynolds, African-American Coalition of Hopkins County President. Bill McReynolds is the President of the African-American coalition of Hopkins County. He says he has met with local officials about the monument nearly a year ago. “We weren’t trying to get the statue torn down or anything, we just ask that it be relocated,” says McReynolds. “It signifies a real dark past, you know oppression of black people for over a hundred years, and it’s just pretty sad for this to be the best town on earth, and to have a statue like that right in the heart of Downtown Madisonville, it’s hypocritical to say the least.” McReynolds says he’s planning to organize a round-table discussion with local leaders and pastors about racial issues. He hopes it will occur next week. For Cox, he says he hopes leaders notice the petition and make a change. “This is a separate issue that was born from my feelings in the last few years, more so in the last few months, especially with George Floyd happening,” says Cox. 44News reached out to the City Mayor and Judge Executive for comment. We have yet to hear back. As of Tuesday afternoon, the petition has more than 3,000 signatures. It’s unclear how many of those signatures are people who live in Hopkins County or the state of Kentucky. Comments comments",0.0

(WEHT) – Confederate monuments are back in the spotlight across the country. Communities are grappling with taking them down. A Tri-State statue is the focus of another effort to have it removed. An online petition has been started to relocate the Confederate soldier statue in Madisonville. It’s stood outside the old Hopkins County Courthouse since 1908. “There’s been a lot of different opinions of it,” says Steve Cox, who started the online petition. “I guess with everything, the unrest, that’s right now that’s something to consider,”adds Jayne White of Madisonville. “My opinion is if it’s history, good or bad, you cannot change it,” countered Jill Pinkston of Webster County, who said it should remain. Cox believes it should stand somewhere else. He started an online petition calling for its removal. He got the idea this past weekend after attending protests related to the death of George Floyd. “The energy was great, but in the background, you can still see this confederate soldier looming over the entire protest and it, it just didn’t seem right,” he recalled. The petition calls the statue a “disgusting remnant and a message of hate”. It also suggests it be replaced with one of an American soldier from Madisonville, or someone who had a global impact more than 3,000 people signed the online petition as of Tuesday afternoon . “it reminds me of black people’s oppression in all that they had to deal with,” said Bill McReynolds of the African-American Coalition of Hopkins County, who was part of a separate effort to remove the statue. He says recent events around the county could cause more to revisit issues like confederate statues. “If you’re really looking to make a better world and make your location or community better, we have to have these meetings. We have to have these talks, visit things that matter in our community,” he said. Cox also says he plans to meet with local leaders in the near future about his petition.

It does not show the incident or any footage of Reed or police. Instead, the eyewitness video, which was shared on Facebook Live, is of three women describing the events they say they witnessed on May 6. “We saw it from the beginning to end,” one says. “We seen the whole thing,” another woman says. Reed, 21, was fatally shot near 62nd Street and Michigan Road following a police pursuit that was broadcast live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say Reed fired a weapon. As he ran, an officer first attempted to tase him, police say, but the taser failed to stop Reed. An officer then shot Reed. Lawyers representing Reed's family issued a news release Tuesday stating that individuals who witnessed Reed's shooting have provided details that call into question IMPD's version of the incident. ""Every witness that spoke with Mr. Reed's family's attorneys disputed that Mr. Reed brandished a weapon or shot a gun before he was shot to death,"" the release states. A spokesperson for the Reed family's lawyers said the newly revealed video disproves the police department's assertions that Reed fired at officers. “It’s a blatant cover-up of an unjust murder in broad daylight,"" said Elayne Rivers, a spokesperson for The Law Firm of Fatima Johnson, which represents Reed's family. “We have sufficient evidence that shows that the murder was completely unnecessary.” In a statement, IMPD Deputy Chief of Investigations Craig McCartt said: IMPD has repeatedly asked that any members of the community who may have witnessed the incident or who may know of additional video share that information with investigators. To this point, no one has come forward with such information. And as recently as last week, IMPD investigators were in contact with attorneys for the Reed family and were not made aware of such witnesses or evidence. We continue to implore anyone with information on this incident to step forward by calling the Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 317-262-TIPS. We also hear those in the community understandably asking for the release of more information. Because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, it will be the responsibility of the special prosecutor to make those determinations – and unfortunately, no special prosecutor has been named subsequent to the decision made by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office to decline oversight over the investigation. We appreciate and understand those requests from the community, and IMPD supports the swift appointment of a special prosecutor. 'Shot this man in his back' I have obtained a copy of the video, but I have been unsuccessful in reaching the person who posted it. “They just shot this man, y’all,” one unidentified woman said on the video. “The police just shot this dude on 62nd and Michigan, y’all.” She continues: “They done shot this man, y’all in his back for no reason after they done already tased this (slur). He was on the ground shaking, and they still shot this man. That is so crazy.” There’s back and forth conversation, and she adds: “They killed this man for no reason; shot this man in his back.” Rivers said the women who witnessed the incident in the video I watched were hesitant to come forward because they feared for their safety but felt compelled in part because of the protests and unrest occurring in American cities grappling with police brutality and excessive use of force. In the news release, lawyers assert that IMPD and city officials continue to delay offering details about their request that the FBI and Department of Justice monitor the investigation, and have not yet released the name of the officer who shot Reed. The attorneys also charge that the coroner's office has refused to release Reed's autopsy report. ""These actions, along with the pace of the investigation, have forced public questioning of the IMPD's version of account of the incident,"" the release states. “If IMPD were investigating, how come they didn’t find it?"" Rivers asked, referring to the video witnesses provided lawyers. ""They’re not trying to find it. They are trying to cover up that they went rogue,” she said. On Sunday, lawyers filed a motion in Marion Superior Court requesting that the court compel IMPD to release the name of the officer who shot Reed; the name of the officer who was disciplined for saying ""I think it's going to be a closed casket, homie"" when he arrived at the scene of the shooting; and all other officers who were present within 30 minutes of the incident. IMPD officials have said in the past in regards to Reed's death that they were withholding the names because threats were being made against officers. Officials have released no further information on the status of those threats. The day of Reed's death Reed first caught the attention of IMPD officials after they say they witnessed him driving erratically. Police said that around 6 p.m. Deputy Chief Kendale Adams saw Reed driving recklessly and almost striking another car on I-65 near 30th Street. Adams, in an unmarked car but in uniform, initiated a pursuit. IMPD Chief Randal Taylor, in another unmarked car behind Adams, aided. Other officers joined the pursuit as Adams and Taylor disengaged, but by 6:10 p.m. an IMPD sergeant ordered the other officers to end the chase because of how fast Reed was driving. An officer then saw Reed's car traveling eastbound on 62nd Street before pulling into a business. Both the officer and Reed left their cars, and a foot pursuit began. There was a confrontation that involved an exchange of gunfire, police said. Rivers said Reed was likely speeding — he was on his way to pick up his girlfriend and was driving her car. He called her and told her he had just awakened and was running late. Later, the girlfriend saw Reed on Facebook Live broadcasting the pursuit. ""Almost lost him y'all!"" Reed says. ""Almost got rid of his ass!"" A little while later, Reed is laughing and cheering as he thinks he lost the officer. ""I'm not going to jail today!"" he shouts. Reed's video captured him in the car talking to his audience. ""Somebody come get my stupid ass,"" he implored before he bailed from the car. “Please come get me! Please come get me! Please come get me! I’m at 62nd and Michigan,” he says at one point. Hackney: 'Please come get me!' Facebook Live police shooting victim's final act For three days after his death, protests occurred at the location where he was gunned down. IMPD Chief Taylor attended one protest, and had a tense exchange with Reed's family. An investigation takes time, Taylor said, and police would use eyewitness accounts, Facebook videos and officer statements to determine what happened. Taylor told the family ""there was indeed a weapon,"" adding that the gun was fired. He promised the family that the investigation would be open and impartial. ""The only thing I can assure you is this,"" Taylor said. ""I will be fair, and I will be transparent. Not only with this family but any family that deals with this kind of stuff in Indianapolis. ""I give you my word on that."" Rivers does not dispute that Reed was in possession of a gun when he was killed. Like 34% of Indiana residents, he was legally licensed to carry, she said. Rivers said lawyers have extensively reviewed Reed's video, slowing portions down, for pertinent details. They insist he never fired at officers. “He’s exercising his Second Amendment right,” she said. “The gun was in his waist. It stayed in his waist as he ran from the police.

Vechirko’s case is still under investigation, according to his attorney Mike Freeman. “Investigators are in the process of gathering additional information and answers to aid in the charging decision,” the Hennepin County Attorney’s office said Tuesday. A law enforcement official who witnessed the incident told Fox News it appeared to be an accident. MINNESOTA TRUCK INCIDENT AT PROTEST LIKELY AN ACCIDENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington reportedly said Monday that Vechirko did not drive around any barricades or internationally toward any people, according to the Star Tribune But Minnesota State Police called Vechirko’s actions “disturbing” and some witnesses at the protest said his driving into the crowd appeared to be deliberate. Vechirko drove into a crowd of 5,000, where demonstrators were said to be peacefully protesting the death of George Floyd, around 6 p.m. Protesters surrounded his car and opened both the driver and passenger side doors. Only Vechirko suffered minor injuries and no protesters appeared to be seriously injured. GEORGE FLOYD DEATH: MINNESOTA FILES HUMAN-RIGHTS COMPLAINT AGAINST MINNEAPOLIS POLICE Vechirko was arrested on suspicion of assault and a mugshot of his was released Sunday evening.

But the peaceful marches against police brutality and racism were overshadowed by riots that saw buildings burned, businesses looted, and people injured. Many of the protesters have denounced the violence as being committed by perpetrators who are simply looking to capitalize on the moment by inciting anarchy and destruction. Some have blamed Antifa, the far-left militant movement that President Trump wants to designate a terrorist organization. Others, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have blamed “white supremacists” and “out-of-state instigators.” But despite the denunciations of bad actors, many of the signs accompanying these protests cast doubt on a unifying, peaceful message. Among the more straightforward signs like “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breathe,” can be found more incendiary references against law enforcement. For instance, the acronym “ACAB” has been spotted at different protests, whether graffitied onto buildings or written on placards. The acronym stands for “All Cops Are Bastards” and has been around since at least the 1970s. It has been widely used throughout Europe during protests. Some signs have called for defunding or abolishing the police – an idea that has been gaining traction long before the death of George Floyd. Others have been less “diplomatic” with their signs, like those that say “F— the police,” or the variant, “My Dad Said F— The Police.” Though the movement may intend to be peaceful, law enforcement agencies were bracing for another night of unrest on Tuesday. LEBRON JAMES, STEPHEN JACKSON SHARE POWERFUL CONVERSATION OF JACKSON’S FRIEND GEORGE FLOYD President Trump has turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” Earlier Trump had threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it.

Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump’s rhetoric about using troops to “dominate” protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as “weak” for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state’s National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. “I am not going to send our men and women in uniform — a very proud National Guard — to Washington for a photo op,” Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the “president of law and order” and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America’s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request “additional assistance,” a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn’t have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent “explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.” Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and “are not there in any law enforcement capacity.” Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. “When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,” Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ------ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(Photo: Jordan Kartholl / The Star Press) MUNCIE, Ind. — Voters from the Democratic and Republican parties narrowed down ample fields of candidates for Delaware County Council at-large seats in Tuesday's primary election. The choices included, in addition to the three incumbents, an attorney, an activist minister, two educators, a retired probation officer, a 24-year-old political science graduate, and a factory quality-control inspector frustrated over ""the lack of candidates to choose from year after year."" The seven-member council appropriates all funds for county use, adopts the county budget, fixes the county tax rate, and has exclusive power to borrow money for the county. ► Full results: See who won each race during Tuesday's primary. Republicans hold a 5-2 majority on the current council, which includes four district seats not up for election this year and three at-large seats to be voted into office this fall.

He received 5,940 votes. Incumbent Jessica Piper, 39, a senior analyst at Newell Brands who favors sticking to a balanced budget and not going into debt. She received 5,276 votes.

He has said the property tax caps make it challenging to maintain the county roadways, bridges, drainage, right of ways, police protection, EMS services, and voting services that people expect.

Protests. Curfews. Coronavirus. Despite it all, many voters in Marion County put on their masks and went out to vote to have their voices heard. They found hour-long lines. Some stretching around a whole building. And they waited. Some were motivated by the ongoing protests against police brutality against African Americans. Others, one way or another, by the president's actions. Many wanted a say in two open Congressional races. At this point, it's hard to say whether turnout was high or whether the lines were a result of the state's largest county only mustering enough volunteers to operate 22 voting places. Or both. Some of the suburbs, especially in Hamilton County, reported much shorter lines. In Carmel and Fishers, voting seemed to be measured in minutes, not hours. Holding the primary amid the coronavirus and the protests was one thing. Knowing who won will be another. More than half a million Hoosiers voted absentee. It could take days for some counties to process all of those ballots. Or longer. The final count hardly matters in some races, where the primary was a formality. President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden nabbed their nominations in all but name months ago. Gov. Eric Holcomb and his Democratic opponent, Dr. Woody Myers, were uncontested. With many votes still uncounted, the AP called the Fifth District race for Democrat Christina Hale and Republican Victoria Spartz. Hale declared victory and Republicans sent out a note congratulating Spartz. The winners of the open First District outside Chicago remained a mystery. County races and school referendums also were on the ballot throughout the state. The winners? We'll see. Marion County voters spurred by protests In Marion County, voting sites at Broad Ripple and North Central high schools had especially long lines throughout the day. Both are in that competitive Fifth District race, where 20 Democrats and Republicans are vying to replacing Rep. Susan Brooks in what is widely expected to become a swing district. Russell Hollis, deputy director at the Marion County Clerk's Office, said the office had to add more workers and machines to help speed things up at Broad Ripple. Hollis pointed out that the reduction in the number of voting sites this year led to the long lines. Marion County usually has more than 250 places to vote, not 22. Some voters used the longer waits to their advantage. At North Central, Jen Brown held a cardboard ""Black Lives Matter"" sign. “I knew that I’d be standing in line for a really long time today,"" Brown said. ""What better time to make a statement like this?” Her sentiments were a common theme throughout the metro area. At Prairie View Christian Church in Fishers, Sharon Metzger, 27, said the protests greatly influenced her determination to vote to change the status quo. “As a black woman,"" she said, ""it made me see how very important it is to cast my vote for me and my friends and family who are like me — black women. ""I’m scared, I’m angry and I want to make a difference.” Unlike in Marion County, all 125 polling locations in Hamilton County were fully staffed and open. Matt Nettleton, 53, Fishers, said he, too, was motivated by the protests and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “It influenced my determination to vote,” Nettleton said. “You can see at the national level both parties don’t know what they are doing.” Travis Stall, 40, Fishers, said he knew Chris Beatty, who was one of two people fatally shot Downtown over the weekend as protests raged nearby. “I grew up on the east side of Indianapolis, Post Road,"" said Stall, who is white. “I understand why this is a significant issue in that community.” He said he was committed to voting because he feels it’s time for President Trump to go. “It is critical we collectively come together,"" Stall said, ""and vote this administration out of office. We don’t need to see any more evidence this is clearly not working.” At Carmel United Methodist Church, 24-year-old Mitchell Wallace said he was voting for change and supports the protests. “It made my decision easier,” he said. Subscribe Today | Indy Star Others worried about the riots. At Perry Meridian High School, Carol Richardson, who is black, said the violent turn of the protests horrified her. She added that she doesn’t think those involved in the peaceful part of the protests took part in the violence and quoted Martin Luther King Jr.'s increasingly prevalent line that riots are the voice of the unheard. “You’re ripping up your own neighborhood,” she said. “You’re burning down and violating your own space.” She was among some voters who were confused by the drastic reduction in the number of places to vote in Marion County. She went to her usual neighborhood poll before finding it closed and heading to Perry Meridian. Some would wait all day to vote While long lines can be frustrating, many voters indicated they would not be deterred. Some voters waited in line long after the polls officials closed at 6 p.m. At Warren Central, the line stretched all the way round the building once the poll closed and some voters reported parking was difficult to find. Lisa Davis and her daughter waited about two hours in Broad Ripple. “I’ve voted and voted and voted,"" said Lisa Davis, ""and this is the longest I’ve every waited .... With what we’re dealing with now, I absolutely think I’m more passionate about voting than I ever have been before."" Out of work as a server because of the pandemic, Carly Gonzalez, 27, said she would wait all day if necessary. “There’s a lot of unrest,"" she said, ""and I think people want to speak on it the only way we can as peacefully as possible."" Robert L. Stewart, Jr., 61, who lives in Meridian Kessler, came prepared with bottles of cold water, umbrellas to ward off the sun, and folding chairs on which to sit as the line progressed. The heat was an issue. Mid-day as the sun beat down, paramedics arrived at Broad Ripple to tend to a would-be voter who had fallen ill. “Voting’s been a privilege for years and most people take it seriously,” Stewart, Jr., said. Absentee voting wasn't all smooth Roughly 546,000 Hoosiers —including 124,000 in Marion County — requested to vote by mail this primary. Some ballots never came, though. Others arrived too late to send back. Voters were left wondering what to do. The fiasco caused a political stir and finger pointing between Marion County Clerk Myla Eldridge and Secretary of State Connie Lawson. Eldridge said the post office has taken weeks to deliver many ballots to voters and asked to extend the deadline to return the ballots past noon Tuesday. ""In short,"" she wrote to the Secretary of State, ""this could mean that thousands of ballots will remain uncounted despite the best efforts of the Marion County Election Board and the voters themselves."" Lawson sent a letter back saying Marion County waited too long to shift into high gear and should have reached out sooner for help. Weeks ago Nikki Mungal-Stille requested an absentee ballot. It never arrived, so she arranged with a colleague to take some time away from her nurse practitioner duties to vote. She found a long line at North Central. “I feel like it would be more effective to have multiple locations (to vote),” she said. Jeff Johnson also requested a ballot that never came. While he confessed he doesn’t always vote, he decided that this election would not be one of those times. “I just felt that this is important to come out,” he said. “It’s not really a particular race. It’s not until the presidential election that would be really important.” Connie Martin, who has been voting regularly since she turned 18 in 1975, requested an absentee ballot but it too came late. Instead, she joined the line at Broad Ripple. November could be even worse, she worries. “If they get absentee ballots out in time it won’t be but of course some people are trying to stop that from happening,” she said. Safety measures in place Polling sites looked different this primary, with social distancing measures and PPE in place to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. In many cases, poll workers wore masks, used longer tables and had voters spread out in line using marks on the ground — just like the checkout lines at grocery stores. At James Garfield School on the south side, hand sanitizer was provided at the door. Poll workers wore masks and gloves, and cleaned often-touched surfaces. For voters, masks and finger cots for touchscreen voting were available. Cody Howell, a local medical student, voted at James Garfield after he failed to receive an absentee ballot in the mail. “I’ve been taking as much precautions as possible,"" he said. ""I know most people are. And so I didn’t feel particularly unsafe.” Carmel voter Dinesh Deshmukh, 51, said he has frequently voted early or absentee in the past but was too busy this time to do so. Still, he said had no worries about showing up in person. “They seem to have done a good job with social distancing and other precautions,” he said. “It was not crowded and it took me five minutes so that made it even easier.” Some prefer voting in person Some voters worried about the security of voting by mail. At Eastbrook Elementary, 38-year-old Kandice Franklin opted for in-person voting because she didn't want to risk her vote ""getting lost in the shuffle."" John Braun stood in line for about 20 minutes at Perry Meridian. He thought about sending in an absentee ballot, but didn’t trust it. “I’m just voting to do my duty,” he said. David Weaver, 73, Carmel, said he voted in person because it seems more hands-on “and I think it is just a personal thing.” He said that although he is in a “high risk” age group for the coronavirus he was confident it was safe. “I just saw my doctor and don’t have it as far as I know,“ Weaver said. Mike and Janet Gaines voted at Fishers City Hall. Janet said they never considered mail-in ballots because “there’s just something about pulling the lever yourself and being there in person.” Susan McGregor, 72, said she wasn’t apprehensive about voting in-person because of COVID-19 but was prepared with mask and sanitizer. “To be honest,"" she said, ""I never paid attention to how to vote by mail this time."" And now, they all join the candidates in waiting. How long, we'll see. Call IndyStar reporter Chris Sikich at 317-444-6036. Follow him on Twitter: @ChrisSikich.",0.0

For more information, read our full story. — Arika Herron 'This is the longest I’ve ever waited' For many voting has become even more of a necessity with the events of the past weeks. ""I’ve voted and voted and voted and this is the longest I’ve ever waited,” said Lisa Davis, who was waiting with her daughter, a first-time voter. As their wait stretched into the second hour, Davis said she did not mind the wait at all. “With what we’re dealing with now, I absolutely think I’m more passionate about voting than I ever have been before,” she said. Out of work because of the pandemic, Carly Gonzalez, 27, who worked as a server, said she would wait all day if necessary. Gonzalez said she has expected the lines would be even longer. “There’s a lot of unrest and I think people want to speak on it the only way we can as peacefully as possible,” she said. First-time voter D.J. McCall also came prepared to spend the day waiting if that’s what it took. The 24-year-old, who plays basketball for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, had never voted in person before, although his grandmother and mother had always encouraged him to do so but until now he never had. This year, however, with everything going on, McCall decided he had to act and the crowds he encountered inspired him. “I think it was the right thing for me to get out and vote today,” he said. “It’s really cool to see all these people come out today. I hope to vote consistently from here on out.” Others said that they vote in every election and this one was no different despite everything else that’s going on. “Voting’s been a privilege for years and most people take it seriously,” said Robert L. Stewart, Jr., 61, who lives in Meridian Kessler as he prepared to wait to vote for up to two hours at Broad Ripple High School. Some came prepared with bottles of cold water, umbrellas to ward off the sun, and even folding chairs on which to sit as the line progressed. Mid-day as the sun beat down, paramedics arrived at Broad Ripple High School to tend to a would-be voter who had fallen ill. This was Aaron Stewart-Curet’s third time voting in a primary and nothing like the others. Had the 25-year-old known the line would be so long, he would never have worn long pants, he said. Despite his fashion choices – and the fact that he was on his lunch break – Stewart-Curet said he had no intention of leaving before he cast a ballot. It was a slow day at work and voting is critical. “I was always trained this way,” he said. “If you want change to happen, this is what you do.” Many people in line said that they had requested absentee ballots but they never arrived or it did not arrive in time for them to mail it in. Connie Martin has voted in every election since turning 18 in 1975. She requested an absentee ballot but it came too late. Instead, she joined the line at Broad Ripple High School. November could be even worse, she said. “If they get absentee ballots out in time it won’t be but of course some people are trying to stop that from happening,” she said. This was the first time voting for Sam Butler, 19, who came to Broad Ripple High School to vote with his mother Donna. The IU student confessed that he had figured voting would take about 15 minutes and that he was getting pretty hungry as the wait stretched into an hour. Still he had every intention of waiting for his turn and returning in November, when he said, he thinks “the line will be twice as long.” His mother Donna said that she wondered whether elections officials made the right decision by choosing to close many voting places. “I just think since they condensed locations it’s so congested,” said the Broad Ripple resident. “I don’t think it’s a great idea with COVID-19."" Although Luisa Kolb, 23, has voted before, this was her first time coming out to vote in the primary. Like many, she said, a desire to be part of a change had motivated her. “Just the political environment in our country, we need to do something about it. We need to go out and vote,” said the northside resident. “I just want to have my voice heard.” A 2008 North Central graduate Tom Wellman, 30, had not been back since leaving. Now he along with his wife Carly were prepared to spend more than an hour waiting to go inside to write-in votes for one-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose name Wellman sported on his T-shirt. “We believe that voting for Sanders will help push the agenda in ways we wanted,” said Carly Wellman, from under a black umbrella she was using to shield her from the sun. Despite the heat, A.J. Williams, 23, stood on line swathed in a black sweatshirt commemorating Breann Leath, an IMPD officer who was shot on the job in April. Williams said that nothing would stop him from coming out to cast a vote. “My people weren’t allowed to vote. I just want to do my part,” he said. Absentee ballots going absent: Weeks ago Nikki Mungal-Stille requested an absentee ballot. One never arrived. So she arranged with a colleague to take some time away from her nurse practitioner duties so she could vote. First she went to the firehouse near her office where she usually votes only to find a sign directing her to North Central. Once she arrived, she found herself in a long line. “I feel like it would be more effective to have multiple locations,” she said. But at least, she said, she had colleagues who would help her get to the voting place, given the difficulties she had getting a ballot and finding a polling place. “It’s very unfortunate for people who do not have the time to step away,” she said. Jeff Johnson, a counselor with the Indianapolis Public Schools, also requested a ballot that never came. While he confessed he doesn’t always vote, he decided that this election would not be one of those times.He brought a book of short poems and stories easy reading for waiting online to pass the time, though he added that no one race was motivating him. “I just felt that this is important to come out,” he said. “It’s not really a particular race. It’s not until the presidential election that would be really important.” One woman who refused to give her name had nothing positive to say about Tuesday’s voting experience. Earlier in the morning she had gone to Broad Ripple High School and left when she saw the long lines there. Mid-afternoon she returned to North Central, where she grumbled as she stood under a red umbrella. “This is a horrible experience,” she said. “Usually it takes five minutes. Now it takes an hour in the heat.” Some people came out for specific races. Although Jana Pehler’s grown children did not attend Washington Township public schools, she said she was supporting the referenda to increase the district’s operating expenses and make capital investments in the schools. “I never had a child go through the school system but it’s my neighborhood, children, the future,” said the Northside resident. Robert Strickland does not agree. The 66-year-old man lives close to North Central High School and he does not like some of the plans, which he fears will bring more buses to what is basically his back yard. “It’s going to add over 50 more buses,” he said. “All the stink and the noise. It’s going to be a parking lot.” Rich Lunseth, 62, and his wife took turns voting, so the other could stay with their son who has special needs. After his wife warned him about the wait at North Central, Lunsett brought a hat, a chair and recruited his friend Robert Strickland, 66, to wait with him. The two sipped on cold drinks and chatted as the line moved. While Strickland said one of the races that had brought him out was the Washington Township Schools referenda, which he opposes, his friend said he had come to vote in the Congressional Fifth District race for Dee Thornton. “I would like to see her get in because she’s an African-American woman,” Lunseth said. “I think they’re a non-represented population and I hope get an African-American woman vice president.” — Shari Rudavsky Some say protests play influence in voter turnout At Prarie View Christian Church in Fishers, Sharon Metzger, 27, said the protests greatly influenced her determination to vote to change the status quo. “As a black woman it made me see how very important it is to cast my vote for me and my friends and family who are like me, black women, ” she said. “I’m scared, I’m angry and I want to make a difference.” Matt Nettleton, 53, said he too was motivated by the protests and the government handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “It influenced my determination to vote,” Nettleton said. “You can see at the national level both parties don’t know what they are doing.” That’s why, for the second presidential primary in a row, he voted for Democrat Bernie Sanders. “I want the guy who is going to cause the biggest ruckus,” he said. “It is definitely a protest vote.” Travis Stall, 40, said he knew Chris Beatty, who was fatally shot downtown over the weekend as protest raged nearby. “I came to do my civic duty with him in mind, at the front of my mind,” said Stall, adding that he emphasizes with the social justice goals of the demonstrators. “I grew up on the east side of Indianapolis, Post Road, said Stall, who is white. “I understand why this is a significant issue in that community.” He said he was committed to voting anyway because he feels it’s time for President Donald Trump to go. “It is critical we collectively come together and vote this administration out of office, Stall said. “We don’t need to see anymore evidence this is clearly not working.” — John Tuohy Election Day comes amid nationwide protests Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Tuesday he would extend a curfew order for Marion County to begin at 9 p.m. and end 6 a.m. Wednesday. It's the third night of curfew following a weekend of protests that morphed into violence and vandalism. Protests across the country were in response to the police-involved killings of people of color, most recently George Floyd in Minneapolis and Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis. More protests were expected Election Day. At Carmel United Methodist Church, Mitchell Wallace, 24, said he was voting for change and that the recent protests had convinced him his candidates were the right choice. “It made my decision easier,” he said. “But it didn’t influence who I voted for.” At Perry Meridian High School, Carol Richardson said the recent protests didn’t impact how she planned to vote, but they still horrify her. She believes that often-quoted remark from Martin Luther King, Jr. that riots are the voices of the unheard. But she doesn’t think the people involved in the peaceful part of the protests took part in the violence. “You’re ripping up your own neighborhood,” she said. “You’re burning down and violating your own space.” Lisa Delp, 53, said “I have always voted in every election” and the protests didn’t make her convince her to change her vote. At North Central High School, Jen Brown, Indianapolis, held a cardboard Black Lives Matter sign while waiting to vote. “I knew that I’d be standing in line for a really long time today,"" Brown said. ""What better time to make a statement like this.” Long lines at some sites Despite the high number of absentee ballots, some polling sites experienced long lines, made longer by the required social distancing. The line at Perry Meridian High School reached roughly 100 people around noon, with the line stretching out the door and along the building. One voter said it only took about 20 minutes to vote. One person compared the line at Broad Ripple High School to the lines at Cedar Point amusement park in Ohio. Video shows a long line stretching down the sidewalk. Some voters reported a wait time of up to an hour. Russell Hollis, deputy director at the Marion County Clerk's Office, said they've put a call in for more workers and machines to help speed things up at the Broad Ripple site. Hollis pointed out that the reduction in the number of voting sites this year is contributing lines. Marion County has 22 voting locations this year. It usually has more than 250. At Carmel Clay Educational Center, precinct inspector Aaron Young said 110 people had cast ballots by noon. “It’s slow but better than I had expected,” he said. North Central High School was also experiencing long lines Tuesday afternoon, with a couple of voters saying it took over an hour to vote. The polling site is in the 5th District, where 15 Republicans are vying for a chance to replace retiring District 5 Rep. Susan Brooks. Opting for in-person voting Roughly 546,000 Hoosiers - including 124,000 in Marion County - requested to vote by mail this primary. But some voters are choosing to opt for in-person voting, whether it's because of concerns or nostalgia. Never before, have as many as half a million Hoosiers voted by mail in one election. That's a lot of ballots to mail out and count. It's hard to say how it will go. Marion County Clerk Clerk Myla Eldridge said the post office has taken weeks to deliver many ballots to voters. ""In short,"" she wrote in a letter to the Secretary of State, ""this could mean that thousands of ballots will remain uncounted despite the best efforts of the Marion County Election Board and the voters themselves."" The Secretary of State sent a letter back saying Marion County waited too long to shift into high gear and should have reached out sooner for help. At Eastbrook Elementary, 38-year-old Kandice Franklin said Tuesday that she opted for in-person voting over mail-in voting because she didn't want to risk her vote ""getting lost in the shuffle."" But for some, in-person voting is tradition. David Weaver, 73, said he voted in person because it seems more hands-on “and I think it is just a personal thing.” Mike and Janet Gaines voted at Fishers City Hall. Janet Gaines wanted to vote in person because “there’s just something about pulling the lever yourself.” Mike Gaines said he was in the Air Force 23 years and doesn’t completely trust mail-in ballots, which is how on-duty military vote. Susan McGregor, 72, said she wasn’t apprehensive about voting in-person because of COVID-19 but was prepared with a mask and sanitizer. “To be honest I never paid attention to how to vote by mail this time,” she said. Dinesh Deshmukh, 51, said he has frequently voted early or absentee in the past but was too busy this time to do so. He said he had no worries about showing up in person. “They seem to have done a good job with social distancing and other precautions,” he said. “It was not crowded and it took me five minutes so that made it even easier.” Safety protocols in place Polling sites look different this primary election, with social distancing measures in place to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. At James Garfield School on the south side, hand sanitizer is provided at the door and pieces of tape mark where voters should stand to practice social distancing. Poll workers wore masks and gloves, and cleaned often-touched surfaces. For voters, masks and finger cots (for touchscreen voting) were available. According to Secretary of State Connie Lawson, Indiana planned to procure personal protective equipment for all 92 counties using vendors outside of critical health care supply lines. In most cases, poll workers will wear masks, use longer tables and socially distance, officials said. Many clerks say voters will stand in line while spread out by marks on the ground — just like the checkout lines at grocery stores. Cody Howell, a local medical student, voted at James Garfield School after he never received an absentee ballot in the mail. He applied before the deadline, he said, but didn’t get one. He still felt comfortable enough to drop by the polls in person. “I’ve been taking as much precautions as possible, I know most people are,” he said “And so I didn’t feel particularly unsafe.” Indiana primary:Open seats in the General Assembly add intrigue to election At Eastbrook Elementary, roughly 50 people stood in line at 10:30 a.m., with people standing spaced apart. A group at the polling site was offering free meals for people in need, as the coronavirus pandemic has strapped families. Absentee ballot glitches in Hamilton County All 125 polling locations in Hamilton County opened on time and were fully staffed with only a couple of glitches, Elections Administrator Beth Sheller said this morning. A few voters tried to turn in their filled-out absentee ballots at their precincts instead of the government center in Noblesville, the only place they can be returned in person, Sheller said. The ballots must be turned in or mailed into the elections office by noon. Voters with absentee ballots that are not filled out can switch them out at their local precincts and vote in person. The county sent out 40,000 absentee ballots — about 10 times the normal amount — and 33,000 have been returned. An additional 3,300 people voted early. There are 247,000 registered voters in the county, and if half of them vote, as happened in 2016, then the absentees would account for about a third of the votes, Sheller said. The 125 precincts is a little more than the usual amount, Sheller said, though several locations have been changed since previous elections. It's Election Day in Indiana The polls will look different this primary Tuesday, as Indiana and the rest of the country continue to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. Many voters already have cast their ballots with the expansion of absentee voting. Roughly 546,000 Hoosiers requested mail-in ballots in the past few weeks. There is some concern those ballots will arrive too late to be counted with an increasing number of Marion County voters complaining their ballots arrived late last week or not at all. Voters who venture outside will see poll workers in protective gear and need to mind social distancing guidelines. Check back here throughout the day for complete coverage from the polls. With the presidential and gubernatorial primary races all but decided, many Hoosiers will have their eyes on the Congressional races. Fifteen Republicans are vying for a chance to replace retiring District 5 Rep. Susan Brooks. And in District 1, a crowded field of Democrats and Republicans will seek to replace Democrat Rep. Peter Visclosky. One of the most compelling races won't be decided by voters at all. Former Congressman Todd Rokita is running to replace Attorney General Curtis Hill on the ticket. The next attorney general will be chosen by Republican state delegates through a virtual state convention June 18. IndyStar staff contributed to this story.

We urge Governor Holcomb to issue an immediate executive order to immediately ban law enforcement from using chokehold restraints, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. This order must include specific repercussions officers will face for violating this ban. If there is no action by the governor, we urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish a local policy that outlaws the use of a chokehold restraint, or other means of restraint that cut off the ability to breathe, as a means of effectuating an arrest in Indiana. Additionally, we urge these entities to immediately implement the use of body cameras for all patrol officers and require them to be on at all times. If not, a penalty should be assessed. We urge the governor to immediately establish a Statewide Criminal Justice Commission, including a diverse appointing of civilian representatives from the cities with significant African American populations, to examine every aspect of our state’s criminal justice system and recommend comprehensive criminal justice reform, including the eradication of racist policing policies. We expect these recommendations to become bills that get passed in the 2021 Legislative Session. We urge Indiana mayors, city councils and chiefs of police to immediately establish local Independent Civilian Review Boards, with members selected by local community activist groups, to review public complaints of police violence. 1:00 p.m. - Mayor Joe Hogsett and IMPD Chief Randal Taylor are providing a public safety update. Mayor Hogsett said the department is changing and updating guidelines for use of force including the following: The department's standard for using deadly force is being updated. The department is updating the requirement for identification and warning before deadly force is used. IMPD will be prohibited from using chokeholds - currently the department does not train or condone the use of chokeholds. De-escalation requirements and training for officers. Duty to intervene or report when another officer uses inappropriate force. Prohibits shooting into a moving vehicle or from a moving vehicle. Comprehensive reporting of lethal and nonlethal uses of force. Rules for using various levels of less-than-lethal force. Mayor Hogsett said everyone in Indianapolis and beyond needs to work every day for change. IMPD Chief Taylor said the officers in the department are working to build bridges with the community, but he understands the mistrust. He said the department will work to improve that relationship. Chief Taylor said he has appreciated the peaceful protests and looks forward to those peaceful protests continuing. IMPD said peaceful protests will be allowed and encouraged this weekend, but any violence or chaos will be handled by the department. IMPD said it will take an education approach first to the 8 p.m. curfew for Friday and Saturday. IMPD said if the protests remain peaceful, they may be allowed to continue past curfew. There will also be a traffic pattern change at that time to help people exit the city and return home. Mayor Hogsett said the city is continuing to review use of force in some of the incidents from the past weekend involving officers that was caught on camera.

Mayor Hogsett released the following statement: “After a difficult weekend, Indianapolis has experienced three days of peaceful protest that has powerfully contributed to a national conversation on our criminal justice system. To the men and women of IMPD: thank you for protecting first amendment rights, under difficult conditions, as our community wrestles with necessary change. And to those who have chosen the path of nonviolent protest—we see you, we hear you, and we will work with you over the coming days, weeks, and months. For the safety of what we believe will be much larger demonstrations this weekend, and given the violence and property damage we experienced this past weekend, we intend to reinstate the curfew order for Friday and Saturday.

He went on to say that he hopes peace makers continue making their message heard. He said people need to focus on efforts to bridge, not divide. Governor Holcomb then said the people who turned to violence and destruction are the same as organized crime. ""(This) has turned into anything but a proper time of mourning,"" Holcomb said. ""Violence in the streets makes all this progress harder and sets us back."" Holcomb said Indiana State Police and the Indiana National Guard will be available to help local governments with any unrest. Indiana State Police Superintendent Douglas Carter said, ""I'm sorry"" when discussing what happened to Floyd. He said law enforcement is ""not without sin,"" but went on to say about the unrest, ""this is not the way."" 12:05 p.m. - Mayor Joe Hogsett has updated yesterday's exective order — setting an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday night— to be extended to Monday night.

Holcomb verbally activated the Indiana National Guard Reactionary Force company to be available to assist local communities Saturday, however no deployment was requested. Several hundred Guard members remain on standby. Ordered members of the Guard, supported by Indiana State Police, to establish a presence at state properties in Indianapolis to protect them from further damage. “At my order, the Indiana National Guard stands ready to assist local communities in need to protect the public and property, and I am deploying Guard members to protect state property beginning today,” said Gov. Holcomb. “Organized protests have taken place across the state without incident but the events that have followed, particularly in Indianapolis, have devastated businesses, defaced public monuments that are centuries old, and resulted in loss of life.” 2 p.m. - Faith leaders are holding a protest in Indianapolis with a list of demands and a call for justice after the police custody death of George Floyd. 12:30 p.m. - IMPD said it will make several announcements and advise people to leave once the curfew goes into effect.

IMPD said the violence then turned to vandalism, looting, fires and ultimately a number of shootings and two homicides. Officers were not able to respond as quickly as they wanted to because of having to secure areas because of the violence. IMPD said that firefighters and IEMS had rocks and other items thrown at them as well as they responded. Order was restored downtown around 4 a.m. The NAACP said it commends those who were out protesting peacefully, but condemns those who came out with intent to cause damage.

In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. With no real competition, Biden and President Donald Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines that brushed up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn't be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors' orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day's biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the country. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and are now focused on other offices. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Rodrique Ngowi of the Associated Press in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

Bush on George Floyd protests: 'It is time for America to examine our tragic failures' Former President George W. Bush on publicly reacted for the first time to the national unrest surrounding the police killing of George Floyd, saying that ""it is time for America to examine our tragic failures."" By Devan Cole, CNN (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush on Tuesday publicly reacted for the first time to the national unrest surrounding the police killing of George Floyd, saying that ""it is time for America to examine our tragic failures."" Bush, a Republican, said in a statement that he and former first lady Laura Bush ""are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country."" ""Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures -- and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths,"" the statement said. The remarks come as widespread protests -- some of which have at times turned violent -- continue to play out across the country demanding justice for Floyd, a black man who was killed last week by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Protesters who have taken to the streets in recent days to draw attention to the case and police violence across America say they want to see charges for all four police officers involved in Floyd's death, though so far officials have only charged the officer who was seen in a video with his knee on Floyd's neck. ""America's greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights,"" Bush said in the statement. Though the statement makes no mention of President Donald Trump -- who has been criticized for his response to the unrest -- its tone contrasts sharply with Trump's public comments. The President has taken a strongman approach to the situation and stoked racial tensions with controversial statements about the protests. ""Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions,"" Bush said. The former President also denounced the looting and destruction that has occurred in some cities in recent days, saying: ""Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress."" Former President Barack Obama also recently released a statement about Floyd's death, saying last week that all Americans should ""work together to create a 'new normal' in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.""

Chanting ""I can't breathe"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans have drawn growing attention online, and demonstrators started showing up anyway. Similar demonstrations are planned in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.”",0.0

(AP) — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest. Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees. The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far: LOUISVILLE As local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by. ""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man."" The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. ___ OAKLAND A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs. ""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA A 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. ___ CHICAGO SUBURB Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there. ___ Associated Press journalist Herbert McCann contributed from Chicago.",0.0

(WEHT) — Most Reverend William F. Medley, Bishop of the Diocese of Owensboro, released the following statement on racism and civil unrest. “I join with civic and religious leaders across the United States to pray for peace and healing as our nation faces yet another crisis of racism, violence, and distrust. Yet again we are appalled at the violent death of an unarmed Black man at the hands of police. This has happened all too often in our land; a land that we declare is grounded in justice for all. I extend my prayers and concern for the family and community of Mr. George Floyd and for the repose of his soul. The violence that led to his death was filmed for all to see and sadly looks all too familiar. As noted by Archbishop José H. Gomez, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mr. Floyd’s death was “senseless and brutal.” I implore all to heed the calls for an end to the violence that has followed this tragedy. Peaceful demonstrators and protestors have a proper and positive place in our society. It is urgent that our communities’ leaders listen and commit themselves to concrete actions to right the injustices that racism breeds; the most noteworthy among these being violence toward people of color. The violence in American cities in recent days is self-destructive and self-defeating. No good can come from violence and destruction. I add my voice to the voices of law enforcement professionals calling for justice. They are rightly ashamed and saddened by recent events. I believe that the vast majority of police men and women desire to serve and protect, and are to be commended for their generous service. Let us as communities and as a nation now listen to the cries of those burdened every day by the sinful effects of racism. Together we can still build a more just society that will assure life, liberty, and equality for all.”",0.0

While a majority of protesters have been wearing masks, those large crowds make it difficult to social distance. And that, according to some experts, could possibly lead to a second wave of the virus. Dr. Jason West, owner of The West Clinic in Idaho, spoke to our Brandon Bartlett about that concern. Transcription Brandon Bartlett: Dr. West. Thanks for joining us tonight. We have gone from staying inside for a month to now seen thousands of people taking to the streets of several cities across the country to protest the death of George Floyd. Is there a concern that those large gatherings could set off a second wave of the Coronavirus? Dr. Jason West: Well, in a weird way, I mean, I hate the violence and I hate the destruction of personal property the looting but in a weird way, it’s kind of a test for the Coronavirus because it should have some increased areas of infection. If there’s a second wave coming and if the protesters aren’t having these infection rate increases, then maybe it’s time we can open up churches and theaters and football events. BB: Yeah, if the virus does begin to spread, how long would it be before we know it? JW: Well, from what I understand from the literature, it’s gonna be two or three weeks. And you know, we’re looking for a dry cough, a fever, an increased, you know, feeling of unwellness. And then hopefully there’s a process where the protesters could get tested if that’s what’s happening, but it’s gonna be a couple weeks. BB: Well, as you know, these protests come while many cities are reopening, but there is no social distancing during most of these protests, some are wearing face masks, but do you think that those actually help in a situation like that? JW: I personally have some concerns that they really aren’t that beneficial. And usually what the literature is saying is that they N-95 masks you have the right pore size, the homemade masks or the modified masks, I think the virus is a lot smaller than the pore size and I’m just not convinced that it’s really going to be that helpful. BB: Okay, well, let’s talk about tear gas. Police have used that on some of the protesters; that makes your eyes water and you usually end up touching your eyes. It also makes you cough. Isn’t that how the virus is spread? JW: Well it could be and we have to remember is it’s the body trying to get rid of things. So the mucous membranes turn on, you get all the tears coming out, you’re coughing to try and get rid of things. And I’m not so certain that in a weird way, it’s not going to basically push things out. I’m not convinced that it’s really going to make it more susceptible for the infection. BB: In your opinion, do you think that protesters should be tested for COVID-19? JW: Well, I just it the whole protesting thing is so I guess emotionally and spiritually confusing to me. Because, yes, I think it was tragic what another human being did to a human being, the protesting, the destruction of property and the rioting and stuff, I don’t see how that really helps. I certainly understand why you would want social reform from this tragedy, from these horrible circumstances. And so for them to get special treatment for testing or anything like that. I don’t see the difference for what they would get tested versus someone else. I just think that there’s more productive ways to create change. BB: Most of the larger protests that we’ve been seeing are taking place in larger cities. There are some reports that some people from smaller towns are traveling to those larger cities to join in those protests. Is there a fear that those people can be exposed during the protests and then take the Coronavirus back with them to their home city? JW: Of course there is I mean, if you think about what we were trying to do with flattening the curve, we wanted to minimize the impact or the wave that was going to go into the healthcare system. And if there is protesters that are paying attention, I mean, if you can help your immune system to be healthy, which is water and vitamin C, and vitamin A and vitamin D, zinc and some of these other things, I think would be beneficial. If you want to minimize your impact, at least do some of the things to keep your immune system healthy. BB: And a majority of the people protesting are African American, and it’s known that the virus affects black Americans more than white Americans. Why is that? And is that a concern? JW: Well, I think what’s happening is is that is, it’s an example of genetics. You get bad DNA from your mom or your dad and some people, it’s gonna cause autoimmune problems. And in certain populations, it just seems that they’re a little bit more susceptible. And again, what we want to do is to try and help their immune systems be as healthy as possible prior to any exposure, and prior to spreading it to anybody else. BB: All right, a lot of great advice tonight, Dr. West. Thanks for joining us tonight. JW: Thank you so much, Brandon, for having me. Stay safe and stay healthy.",0.0

The protest was peaceful, and some people even dropped off bottled water for the protesters. Protesters occasionally said “there’s only one race- the human race.” Jada Morgan-Hawkins says black lives are in danger right now, and she was out there to support the cause and make sure people know. “Everybody- all my friends, family, they’re all black, and one day I hope my kids aren’t out here fighting like this. We’re out here to make sure our kids aren’t doing this one day,” she said. Jada Morgan-Hawkins (left) Morgan-Hawkins explained her sign to us. “It means hopefully one day, I can tell my kids and it’s not history anymore. It’s history to them, but it’s not their life,” she said. People from different races participated in the event, which Morgan-Hawkins said was awesome to know they supported them. Henderson City Commissioner Patti Bugg stopped by the protest as well. She spoke to the crowd before leading a prayer.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. Protesters continued winding through the streets, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, throughout the evening following the May 25 death of George Floyd and other recent racially charged killings. ""I’m surprised,"" said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping."" “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. Police began making arrests around 9 p.m. and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters. The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Jane Rossi said she witnessed officers rip a man out of his car and arrest him in Chelsea around 10:45 p.m. The car was behind a group of several hundred protesters that had roamed Manhattan peacefully since leaving Trump Tower at 8 p.m. Tensions had risen moments earlier when some in the group began trying to damage a bike rental station and banged on the windows of a JCPenny's. The vast majority of the crowd moved to stop the them. Officers surrounded the car and arrested the driver moments later. “They were just driving behind the protesters making sure that we were safe,” Rossi said. “They were part of the protest.” Protests continued in New York City and across the country Tuesday following the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd's neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd's death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city's handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation's largest police force wasn't deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo's remarks infuriated the New York Police Department's highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he'd been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor ""has respect and confidence in the NYPD"" and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. ""We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation's biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. ---- Contributing were Associated Press writers Michael R.

Daly said he got to know Beaty, who owned an event and marketing promotions company, five years ago when he was organizing Indianapolis 500 afterparties. Daly annually had been involved in Beaty’s parties since then and said Beaty helped get him home earlier this year when Daly’s blood sugar crashed while at an event. TAKING A STAND: Lewis Hamilton speaks out on racial strife “The world lost a tremendous person. RIP Chris Beaty,” wrote Daly, who also tweeted “The violence has to stop.” Daly was asked about the tweet Wednesday by NBCSports.com during an IndyCar Zoom. “Obviously Chris was a pretty close friend of mine,” Daly said Wednesday. “Obviously what’s going on now is just tough to see no matter who you are. I just wanted to say something because just how good of a person he was. I didn’t want to dive into anything and create any big story about it or anything. I just felt like he deserved some words. “Obviously he was out there trying to help protect some people who were getting robbed. It’s incredible to see that level of a person that he was. He definitely deserved the respect that people certainly in Indianapolis are giving him. It’s a tough situation all across the country. But, yeah, he was a great guy and he’ll definitely be riding with us this weekend. He was a big IndyCar fan, as well. That’s pretty cool.” NASCAR’s Bubba Wallace and Formula One six-time champion Lews Hamilton called upon fellow drivers to be more outspoken about racial strife and social issues. Daly said it’s important for drivers to speak their minds but also sometimes tricky on how to weigh in on big-picture topics outside racing. Story continues “There’s a lot of business aspects to this sport, for sure, that we have to be aware of,” Daly said. “There are companies that support us, support our team, stuff like that. But realistically you got to say what comes from the heart as well. “I think it’s been great to see a lot of drivers saying what they have. I think it’s a pretty unified message between all the stuff that we’ve seen put on the Internet, for sure. It’s good to see us as a community doing what we are doing. Hopefully we can continue to get some positivity going with our race this weekend as well.” According to the Indianapolis Star, Beaty died after suffering multiple gunshot wounds during Saturday night’s unrest in downtown Indianapolis. We lost an incredible person in Indianapolis over the weekend during the chaos and rioting.

The remarks came even as most Republicans continued to avoid any disapproval of the president. In a memorable scene captured live on television, police cleared Lafayette Park so Trump could walk to nearby St. John's Church and pose with a Bible. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Some Republicans joined in the criticism Tuesday. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property ... but there is a fundamental – a Constitutional – right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,” said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump's visit to the church was unhelpful and not something Scott would have done. “Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,” Scott told Politico on Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was “painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he's attended only once.'' While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,'' she said. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called Trump's walk to the church “confrontational” and said it “distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests and lawful assembly.'' That message “was drowned out by an awkward photo op,'' Lankford said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump “thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that “Democrats' obsession with condemning President Trump” was blinding them to more urgent priorities, such as “ending the riots or advancing racial justice.'' McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville, Kentucky, and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to George Floyd's death. “The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' he said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a “historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.''",0.0

A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. “I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,” said Rudolph, 69. “It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago.” Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument, which had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine.",0.0

French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Chanting “I can't breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd's death. AP: Protests held in high virus areas An Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new coronavirus cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The AP's review focused on large metro counties – the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people – that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While the numbers of cases and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus – and with the ability to spread it – remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. White hate group poses as Antifa A white supremacist group created a fake Twitter account, posed as the leftist Antifa movement and called for violence during the ongoing protests sweeping the nation, the social media giant said Monday. “Tonight's the night comrades,” the group tweeted Sunday. “Tonight we say 'f--- the city' and we move into residential areas ... the white hoods ... and we take what's ours.” The tweet, which also featured an emoji of a black fist and a misspelled Black Lives Matter hashtag, has since been removed and the account was suspended for violating Twitter's manipulation and spam policy. The company identified the organization behind the fake account as Identity Evropa, which is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. DC man ushers protesters in home Rahul Dubey had some unexpected guests Monday night – about 60. They were protesters out after Washington's 7 p.m. curfew and about to be arrested when Dubey frantically waved them into his rowhouse. Police chased them as far as the entrance. Inside, pandemonium ensued as some of the screaming protesters hit by pepper spray sought relief for their eyes with milk and water. On the back patio, neighbors pitched in by handing milk over the fence. “The whole time he didn't think of himself,” said one of the protesters, a 22-year-old Virginia man named Meka who declined to give his last name. “He was just trying to keep everybody safe, make sure we knew our rights and to make sure our spirits were lifted throughout the night.” #BlackOutTuesday spreads in support Though Black Out Tuesday was originally organized by the music community, the social media world also went dark in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, joining voices around the world outraged by the killings of black people in the U.S. Instagram and Twitter accounts, from top record label to everyday people, were full of black squares posted in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Most of the captions were blank, though some posted #TheShowMustBePaused, black heart emojis or encouraged people to vote during Tuesday's primary elections.",0.0

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. US at 'breaking point' Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. ... This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. Midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx. Police made nearly 700 arrests, and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We're going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We're going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city Monday “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died. The mother of Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country.” Trump threat rejected Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries. Joe Biden has been moving closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In Washington, voting stations stayed open until 8 p.m., an hour past the city's curfew. Voting was deemed essential, and city officials said voters would not be subject to arrest. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. to accommodate voting. Minnesota, meanwhile, opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working quickly to determine whether the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.",0.0

Protesters instead gathered for a fifth consecutive day at the Allen County Courthouse. They lined Clinton Street between Main and Berry streets with cases of bottled water and pizza boxes at their feet as they held handwritten signs toward the passing downtown traffic. Like other protesters nationwide, they rallied against police violence and last week's death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. Members of the TenPoint Coalition also stood at the corner of Clinton and Berry streets early evening. Meanwhile, parking lots at Jefferson Pointe and Apple Glen were largely empty hours after police reopened entrances. Jefferson Pointe's management closed the property in response to social media posts calling for a protest there at 2:30 p.m., Fort Wayne Police Department spokeswoman Sofia Rosales-Scatena said. Mall management released the following statement: “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd, and the pain that his death and racial injustices cause in our communities everywhere. We, at Jefferson Pointe, were made aware of a possible gathering taking place at or around our property this afternoon. Because we are private property, we are proactively working with the city of Fort Wayne and the FWPD to ensure safety for our community.” Police received numerous messages, mostly from Facebook, about the planned gathering, Rosales-Scatena said. They decided to take the threat seriously because of other protests nationwide that resulted in property damage, she said. More than 50 downtown windows were smashed in Fort Wayne about 10 p.m. Friday, hours after a peaceful protest began. Some large windows in Jefferson Pointe were boarded up following a memo sent by mall management warning tenants of the rumored demonstration. Roads to the shopping center were reopened at 4 p.m., Rosales-Scatena said. Although the Chick-fil-A drive-thru had a line about 7:15 p.m., it appeared most stores and restaurants in Jefferson Pointe and Apple Glen had closed for the day based on the empty parking lots. There was no question Walmart was closed; the retailer's doors were blocked with stacks of pallets. A few Fort Wayne police vehicles kept watch over Jefferson Pointe as a Garrett police vehicle was stationed at the Apple Glen Walmart. The downtown protest was peaceful as of early evening. asloboda@jg.net sslater@jg.net",0.0

Meanwhile, a 20-year-old suspect has been taken into custody and charged with attempted murder, according to FOX 5 in Las Vegas. Officer Shay Mikalonis, 29, of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was in critical condition on life support after the suspect, identified as Edgar Samaniego, allegedly fired at officers from across the street on Las Vegas Boulevard while the officers were attempting to disperse a group of protesters near the Circus Circus casino, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Samaniego was apprehended by responding SWAT officers, the newspaper reported. GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS: RIOTERS TARGET POLICE ACROSS US 4 SHOT IN ST. LOUIS, 1 IN VEGAS, BRONX HIT-AND-RUN CAUGHT ON VIDEO The shooting happened just before midnight Monday following peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody in that city on May 25. It was unclear if Samaniego was part of the protest. Most of the crowd had already gone home when the shooting occurred, according to the Review-Journal. Samaniego was being held at the Clark County Detention Center without bail. He was previously arrested in April on drug-related and DUI charges. Another shooting occurred the same night near the courthouse. Police shot an armed man who appeared to be wearing body armor as he reached for his gun. He was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said. Lombardo added that while he wasn’t sure the man was affiliated with the protests, the location of the shooting “would lead one to believe that he was,” according to the Review-Journal. “I know this is a difficult day for Nevada. And it’s during these trying times we must remind ourselves that creating a state where justice and peace exist together in partnership, not as a binary choice, is the goal we must all work toward,” Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said in a statement about the shootings, FOX 5 reported. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “I am committed to doing all I can. I am praying for the LVMPD officer who was senselessly shot last night – there is no place for this behavior in Nevada.

Police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground, with his knees against his neck, and ignored Floyd’s pleas that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder, but many believe that is not enough, and others cite the incident as a final outrage after decades of racism and ill-treatment. Protesters are also calling attention to the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by police, and the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. Protests, some of which turned violent, have broken out in cities across the country and world as people call for an end to brutality and injustice. SPEAKING OUT AND PAYING UP Several celebrities, including Chrissy Teigen, Seth Rogan, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Jameela Jamil, Steve Carrell, James Blake, Yara Shahidi, Janelle Monae, Don Cheadle and Patton Oswalt are donating to funds that will help pay for the bail of protesters. In married couple Lively and Reynold’s joint statement, they promised to examine their complicity in systemic oppression. “We’ve never had to worry about preparing our kids for different rules of law or what might happen if we’re pulled over in the car,” the couple wrote in their statement. “We don’t know what it’s like to experience that life day in and day out. We can’t imagine feeling that kind of fear and anger. We’re ashamed that in the past we’ve allowed ourselves to be uninformed about how deeply rooted systemic racism is.” Gabrielle Union wrote on Twitter: “Ok I know I’m blowin up some folks DMs worried cuz I haven’t heard from yall up in Minneapolis & I must sound like a scared mom. Remember to periodically check in & just in case yall need us, we have donated here. Every amount helps. Be careful & please take care of each other”. Kerry Washington shared a video of her hosting a virtual yoga seminar, writing: “Taking time to breathe for those who no longer have breath. Be kind and gentle to yourself today so you can be strong in the fight for justice. For those of you who weren’t able to join the yoga/mediation session today, I encourage you to still embrace a moment of silence to honor these victims and their grieving families.” Anna Kendrick shared a video of police beating protesters, writing: “I mean. They couldn’t stop themselves from blatantly escalating things. Even for a few days, even cynically, even for the optics.” TARGETS John Cusack, meanwhile, said he became a victim of police violence himself during a protest in Chicago. The 53-year-old wrote on Twitter: “Cops didn’t like me filming the burning car so they came at me with batons.”",0.0

Actual soldiers noticed he was holding an AR-15 rifle instead of an M4 or M16, which the National Guard normally carries, the station reported.

Mayor Jenny Durkan said Wednesday evening on Twitter that she was ending the curfew, which had been scheduled to last until Saturday, after she and Police Chief Carmen Best met with community members. “Chief Best believes we can balance public safety and ensure peaceful protests can continue without a curfew,” Durkan said. “For those peacefully demonstrating tonight, please know you can continue to demonstrate. We want you to continue making your voice heard.” Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear. Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course. “Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted. ___ WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it. Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd. Barricades were put up around the Capitol, and the Capitol Police stood guard behind them. “We came here because they make laws here and we want the laws to change,” said Mohammed Wagdy, 26, of nearby Prince George’s County. As an 11 p.m. curfew in Washington neared, community activists urged the demonstrators to head home. Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, provides several clinical details — including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19. The 20-page report released Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide. The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart. The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures. ___ WASHINGTON — As the National Guard and law enforcement officers stood guard near the White House, surveillance planes kept watch on protesters in the nation’s capital from the air. At one point Wednesday night, an FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter were circling overhead. The demonstrators broke up into two groups; one stayed at the White House, the other marched to the Capitol. Protesters held signs and chanted, but there were no indications of any confrontations with law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters stood face to face with military and federal officers who had formed a perimeter around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked on nearby streets, also blocking access. The demonstration was held to protest the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Military police and law enforcement officers from a variety of federal agencies were out in force. A senior Defense official said at least 2,200 Guard members would be on the streets Wednesday. The South Carolina and Utah National Guards had forces in place. Bureau of Prisons personnel wore blue uniforms. There were also agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI hostage rescue team and the Secret Service. Washington’s mayor set an 11 p.m. curfew in the city after earlier restrictions the previous two nights. ___ LIBERTY, Mo. — Civil rights organizations on Wednesday called for the resignation of Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith, hours after a group of mostly black pastors demanded changes to improve relations between police and the city’s minority community. The Urban League of Greater Kansas City, the NAACP’s Kansas City, Missouri branch, and More2 said in a statement that Smith should resign because of his handling of excessive force complaints and officer-involved shootings of black men. “Since November 2019, our Civil Rights organizations, in collaboration with faith and community leaders, have become increasingly appalled and very much concerned about Chief Smith’s questionable leadership of the Kansas City Police Department,” the coalition said in a statement. The group also criticized the city’s Board of Police Commissioners for allowing Smith to conduct internal investigations of officer-involved shootings and complaints of excessive force rather than calling in independent investigators. The police department should be under local control, officers must be required to wear body cameras and the city must dismantle the Office of Community Complaints, which has been criticized as ineffectual, the coalition said. A group of mostly black religious leaders made similar demands earlier Wednesday, but without calling for Smith’s resignation. Emanual Cleaver III, pastor at St. James United Methodist Church, said the pastors believed it was necessary to seek change because: “What happened to George Floyd was nothing new.” He said pastors “will take action” if the city doesn’t respond, though he declined to elaborate. Public relations officers for the department did not immediately respond to the demand that Smith resign. Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said her office was reviewing video of Kansas City police officers who pepper-sprayed two protesters and arrested one who was yelling at police during protests Monday night. Mayor Quinton Lucas said Tuesday that he reviewed videos that had been sent to him from people concerned about police actions, and asked the FBI and federal prosecutors to review any that might violate procedures or show misconduct. Kansas City has endured five days of protests over Floyd’s death while in police custody May 25 in Minneapolis. Peaceful daytime demonstrations devolved into violence. Police used tear gas on protesters for the first four nights before relative calm returned Tuesday night. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister has urged Australians involved in George Floyd-related anti-racism protests around the world to be “extremely cautious.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison was commenting Thursday after Australian journalists came under attack while covering protests in Washington and London. “In terms of some of the violence … that we’re seeing around the world today, for those Australians who find themselves in those situations, I would urge them to show great caution,” Morrison told reporters. “I would urge people to be extremely cautious. These are dangerous situations, people should exercise great care in where they’re placing themselves,” he added. Australia’s ambassador to the United States has complained about two police officers in riot gear lashing Channel 7 journalist Amelia Brace and camera operator Timothy Meyers with a shield and baton on Monday. The network’s news director, Craig McPherson, described the attack as “nothing short of wanton thuggery.” The officers have been placed on administrative leave while their conduct is investigated. Two Nine Network television crews also came under attack from crowd members while reporting Wednesday on protests in London, the network reported. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The police department in North Carolina’s largest city is coming under criticism after a video posted to social media appeared to show officers using chemical agents on demonstrators who were boxed in while protesting the death of George Floyd. The video was recorded Tuesday night by Justin LaFrancois, co-founder and publisher of the alternative Charlotte newspaper Queen City Nerve. He said officers fired tear gas and flash-bangs from behind the protesters, and in front of them as well. He also said officers perched on top of buildings were firing pepper balls down on the crowd. “We were completely trapped,” LaFrancois said. “There was one way to get out, and half of the group did go out that way through the tear gas and through the pepper balls. But for the rest of us, the only route of escape … was to pull up a gate on the parking structure that we were pressed up against.” LaFrancois said people tried to squeeze under the 6-inch opening in the gate and find safety. But as those people looked for an exit from the parking deck, he said officers began firing pepper balls after they entered the deck from the other side. “They were relentless in not allowing us to leave the area that they were trying to get us to leave,” LaFrancois said. “It was the most extreme action that I had seen taken. It was the first time that I was actually in fear for my life.” Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said on Twitter they are looking into the incident. “We are internally reviewing the circumstances that developed this evening on 4th Street to ensure policy and protocol were followed,” the police department tweeted Tuesday. ___ SAN FRANCISCO — A man suspected of robbing a pharmacy in the San Francisco Bay area was fatally shot by officers who thought a hammer he was carrying in his waistband was a firearm, police said Wednesday. Details of the shooting were revealed even as some California counties and cities began plans to end curfews after days of largely peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis. Sean Monterrosa, 22, of San Francisco is the first confirmed death at the hands of law enforcement related to smash-and-grabs and protests in California since Floyd’s death. Vallejo Police Chief Shawny Williams said officers were responding to calls of looting at a Walgreens early Tuesday when the shooting occurred. Officers said Monterrosa began running toward a car when he suddenly stopped, got on his knees and placed his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a firearm in his waistband. An officer shot five times through a car window, striking him once. “The intent was to stop the looting and arrest any perpetrators if necessary. The officers reacted to a perceived threat,” Williams said. John Burris, an attorney for the family, said he is appalled police would shoot at a person who was on his knees with his hands raised. ___ OGDEN, Utah — A criminal justice professor who wrote an inflammatory series of tweets during the nationwide protests said Wednesday he has resigned. Scott Senjo told The Associated Press in an email that he agrees his tweets were “simply wrong” and his resignation from Weber State University would be effective immediately. Last weekend, he tweeted at a black reporter who said he had been hit by New York City police: “Excellent. If I was the cop, you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” He also expressed support for damage done to CNN headquarters in Atlanta. In response to another tweet showing a New York City police car driving into people, Senjo commented: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” Senjo said his posts were part of the “oftentimes vulgar, extreme back-and-forth that can occur on Twitter,” but he now realizes they were “far beyond the realm of acceptable university policy as well as acceptable social norms.” Weber State University has condemned the messages as “abhorrent” and opened an investigation to determine if other measures would be taken to ensure campus safety. The school had placed him on paid leave Tuesday to conduct a review and did not ask him to resign, officials said in a statement. Senjo had been a professor at the college in Ogden since 2000. ___ CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro railed against President Donald Trump while expressing solidarity with the family of George Floyd, whose death in Minneapolis has sparked protests and street violence across the United States. Maduro on Wednesday accused Trump of turning the U.S. military against his own people. He spoke on state TV at a ceremony decorating Venezuelan soldiers credited with fending off a recent attack that the socialist leader blames on Trump. Maduro also extended Venezuela’s solidarity with blacks and young people in the U.S. He says they are taking to the streets demanding an end to racism and police violence. The White House has launched a campaign to oust Maduro. The U.S. and other nations as well as human rights groups condemn Maduro for employing brutal force and torture to silence Venezuelans who oppose the socialist government. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has sent a national response team to Minneapolis and St. Paul to help investigate fires set during unrest following the death of George Floyd. Local and state authorities requested the team’s help in investigating about 100 business fires in Minneapolis and about 35 in St. Paul.

Here’s what you need to know as you start your day … Trump demands Cuomo, de Blasio call in federal reinforcements, New York City survives calmer night as Floyd protesters ignore curfew President Trump demanded that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio call in additional help from the federal government to quell violence during protests over the death of George Floyd as protesters in the Big Apple and other cities nationwide ignored curfews and filled the streets Tuesday. “New York’s Finest are not being allowed to perform their MAGIC but regardless, and with the momentum that the Radical Left and others have been allowed to build, they will need additional help. NYC is totally out of control. @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo MUST PUT DOWN RIOTING NOW!,” the president tweeted late Tuesday. Earlier Tuesday, Trump tweeted: ” ‘Chaos, lawlessness, and destruction take over New York.’ @FoxNews When will Governor Cuomo call the Federal Government for help?” New York City, like others around the country, has been rocked by protests over the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis police custody May 25 after a white officer kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes in a moment caught on cellphone video. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired, arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved in the incident were fired but have not been charged. TUNE IN TODAY: Don’t miss Brian Kilmeade’s interview with President Trump on Fox New Radio’s “The Brian Kilmeade Show” at 9:30 a.m. ET In an effort to slow any potential violence, authorities moved New York City’s curfew to 8 p.m. Tuesday and warned residents that only buses, delivery trucks and the vehicles of essential workers would be allowed in Manhattan south of 96th Street after that time. The NYPD also canceled regular days off for “all full duty uniformed members,” according to a police memo. Still, thousands of protesters remained in the streets hours after the new curfew, even as police enforced new roadblocks. Law enforcement braced for the kind of looting and violence sent the city reeling on previous nights. While there were scattered reports of looting and vandalism, New York City and the country overall appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities.

The president didn’t name an alternative venue. Earlier in the day, GOP officials said they had started visiting potential alternative sites after Cooper, a Democrat, told them the coronavirus pandemic required them to prepare for a scaled-back event if they wanted to hold it in Charlotte. Charlotte officials, meanwhile, said they had heard nothing about the relocation plan and intended to be in contact with the Republican National Committee regarding the city’s contract for hosting the convention.

Steve King, the controversial nine-term Republican congressman from Iowa, lost a heavily contested primary race on Tuesday night to well-funded state Sen. Randy Feenstra. King’s loss in Iowa’s Republican primary appeared to mark the beginning of the end for the provocative lawmaker who for years had been a conservative lightning rod in Washington for his hardline views on issues ranging from immigration to abortion. In recent years, King had become a pariah in his own party as more mainstream GOP lawmakers distanced themselves from his more extreme views and statements. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted early Wednesday that King’s “white supremacist rhetoric is totally inconsistent with the Republican Party, and I’m glad Iowa Republicans rejected him at the ballot.” Click here for more.

She opened up about her experience, saying: “I’m biracial. Most people can’t tell what I’m mixed with, and so much of my life has felt like being a fly on the wall. And so some of the slurs I’ve heard or the really offensive jokes, or the names, it’s just hit me in a really strong way.” She added: “You know, a couple of years ago I heard someone call my mom the N-word.

This happens, of course, against massive nationwide unrest and protests over George Floyd’s murder. She noted: “Probably the safest bet that you have might be your bathroom because you have maybe the least windows or you’re the most tucked in there. And if that’s the case, the least windows and the place that you could lock yourself in the most.” She advised people to “put some blankets and pillows in the tub in case you’re going to need to sleep there,” and a “few non-perishable things that you can eat, some fruit or protein bars.” TWILIGHT STAR GREGORY BOYCE’S CAUSE OF DEATH REVEALED: The cause of the May 13th deaths of Twilight star Gregory Boyce and his girlfriend Natalie Adepoju were fentanyl and cocaine, the Clark County Coroner tells ET.

Xander wore a mask with the words “Black Lives Matter” and carried a sign that read “I can’t breathe”—words repeatedly said by Floyd moments before his death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. “I promise that I will always continue to talk to my child about inequality. And I promise to do all I can to learn more,” the 42-year-old actress captioned the post. “We have had many more of these necessary hard conversations over the last few days, about why people are so angry and sad.” “For a child who didn’t used to see color amongst his friends it’s hard for him to understand, to understand why the past he learns about in school is still very present in our world today,” she continued. “I wanted to give him an opportunity today to do a small neighborhood protest to support his friends and feel like he’s part of the progress that will hopefully happen.” Jones then urged her followers to vote in November. “If you don’t vote for who is governing your city, state and country nothing will change,” she wrote. Other celebrities, including Ariana Grande, Jamie Foxx, John Cusack, Halsey, Cole Sprouse and Emily Ratajkowsi have demonstrated in protests across the country. Sprouse was arrested and ziptied during a protest in Santa Monica, he revealed on social media. “Before the voracious horde of media sensationalism decides to somehow turn it about me, there’s a clear need to speak about the circumstances: Black Lives Matter. Peace, riots, looting, are an absolutely legitimate form of protest,” Sprouse wrote. “I was detained when standing in solidarity, as were many of the final vanguard within Santa Monica. We were given the option to leave, and were informed that if we did not retreat, we would be arrested. When many did turn to leave, we found another line of police officers blocking our route, at which point, they started zip tying us.”",0.0

A portable grill, mesh tent and three garbage cans are also set up near the intersection of West 62nd Street and Michigan Road, suggesting that people spend more than a few moments at a time here. An Indianapolis resident who identified himself as Al X visited Tuesday evening with a handful of friends. He said he's one of about 12 people who come out every day to the tribute established on a sidewalk south of an Indianapolis Public Library branch. He said the group members became acquainted when rallying against Reed's death the night of his killing. He said they come back to show dissatisfaction toward IMPD and city officials for not releasing the name of the officer who shot Reed. “That's not going to be solved until we get that verdict,” he said while pointing at the memorial. ""People are going to be mad about that. I have kids coming up. Is that going to be my son or my daughters? Is it going to be my grandpa? Is it going to be me?"" Earlier on Tuesday, attorneys representing Reed's family shared a video with IndyStar columnist Suzette Hackney. The attorneys said the video bolsters their assertion that the police officer shot Reed in the back after he fell to the ground from a stun gun. Al X said he's glad the witnesses came forward with the video, which shows three women describing what they witnessed while driving near the site of Reed’s shooting. But, he said, Reed’s phone and its livestream of the actual event serve as a convincing enough record of the event. “We know what we know,” he said. ""Sean's phone told the story. It was overkill. The taser would have sufficed."" Lawyers for Reed's family also say the coroner's office has refused to release Reed's autopsy report. Al X pointed out handprints painted on the sidewalk to represent Reed’s facedown posture at the time of his death. He replicated the pose Tuesday and placed a newly made sign — painted red and orange in Reed’s “favorite colors.” The sign said “Right is right. Wrong is wrong. It has nothing 2 do with race.” On the opposite of the memorial, someone previously painted “We love you Sean DaDon” and “I am my brother’s keeper.” The intersection of West 62nd Street and Michigan Road is 8 miles northwest of Downtown, where protesters have spotlighted Reed's death along with police involvement in the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville for five consecutive days. ""I can't say I agree with the vandalism,"" Al X said of damage to Downtown buildings, ""but I can't say I disagree with it, either. I wasn't part of the vandalism, but I can't tell people how to feel. I can't tell people what rage is. I can't tell people how to deal with their anger."" One night after protesters walked harmoniously with police officers near the governor's residence, Al X suggested an unusual challenge to police. He thought it would help vent frustrations and also illustrate a point. ""Put all the guns away and let's have a water balloon fight,"" he said. ""It's a peaceful demonstration. I want them to understand what it's like to be pushed for so long. When you're steadily pushed, of course people are going to revolt. That's human nature.""

Manslaughter and third-degree murder charges have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the officer who prosecutors say held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin and the other three officers at the scene have been fired. The Department of Justice is investigating. This story is being updated throughout the day Wednesday. Please check back for updates. All times Eastern: 5:50 a.m.: NYPD arrest 280 people, looting and vandalism on the decline The New York Police Department made about 280 arrests during Tuesday night/Wednesday morning protests, a lower tally than previous nights, as the city came under an 8 p.m. curfew and stopped for-hire vehicles, CitiBikes and rental scooters that vandals had used to cause trouble. There were fewer officers injured as well with only two suffering minor injuries. There was less vandalism than there has been during previous nights as police sealed off parts of Manhattan even before the curfew took effect. A standoff on the Manhattan Bridge ended without incident when 5,000 demonstrators returned to Brooklyn after they had been prevented from entering Manhattan. 3:04 a.m.: More than 9,000 people arrested across the country More than 9,000 people have been arrested in protests across the country since George Floyd’s death, according to reports. The events leading up to Floyd’s death were filmed, went viral and has been the catalyst for protests nationwide. Police were called at around 8 p.m. on May 25 by an employee of the Cup Foods convenience store alleging that a customer used a counterfeit bill to pay for cigarettes and that the person appeared drunk, according to the 911 log released by the Minneapolis Police Department. The employee went to the car outside the store where the customer was sitting and asked him to return the cigarettes, but was denied, according to the 911 call transcript. The employee described the customer as a 6-foot-6 black man, which was Floyd’s height, and repeated to the 911 operator that he appeared drunk. Around eight minutes later, Minneapolis police officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng arrived at the shop and approached Floyd and two others in the car, according to the criminal complaint. A few minutes after that, officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived to help arrest Floyd, which led to Chauvin placing his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, the criminal complaint said. All four officers were fired, but as of Tuesday afternoon, Chauvin is the only one to have been arrested. He was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota’s Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges against the Minneapolis Police Department Tuesday. 1:50 a.m.: 200 arrested in Houston; Police stress that majority of protesters were peaceful The Houston Police Department announced that they made more than 200 arrests in downtown Houston yesterday and last night involving people engaged in criminal conduct, including throwing rocks and bottles at officers, and people who refused to clear the streets when they were ordered to do so. “This is an extremely low number of arrests considering the thousands of people in our community who marched and demonstrated peacefully today,” the HPD said in a tweet. “We’re not aware of any significant property damage or injuries. We will have updated arrest numbers/info later this morning.”  1:09 a.m.: Prince George’s County police suspends three officers for use of force After seeing cellphone footage of two officers using excessive force while detaining a suspect at a Langley Park gas station in Maryland, Chief Hank Stawinski of the Prince George’s County Police Department and the department’s executive command staff made the decision to immediately suspend the two involved officers and their supervisor while the incident is investigated. In the video, while attempting to handcuff the suspect, one of the officers can be seen kicking the suspect twice. “I am sorry and I am angry. I am sharing the video in the interest of transparency. During my tenure as Chief of Police, four officers have been criminally prosecuted for assault. This will be thoroughly investigated and in keeping with past practice, the findings will be referred to the Office of the State’s Attorney,” said Chief Hank Stawinski. The preliminary investigation revealed the officer who used force observed an assault and attempted to detain the involved suspects. After a foot chase that ended at the gas station, he was able to handcuff one suspect. He is then seen on the video taking the second suspect to the ground. When a backup officer arrived, that second officer assisted the first officer in the apprehension. During that attempt to handcuff the suspect, the first officer kicked the suspect. The two suspects were ultimately released when the assault victim could not be located. 12:31 a.m.: DC National Guard has directed an investigation into use of medical helicopter to target, disperse DC protesters The Washington, D.C. National Guard has announced that they are directing an investigation into the actions of their rotary aviation assets on June 1 after it was reported that their medical helicopters were used to target protesters. According to The Washington Post, numerous videos were posted on social media showing a Lakota medevac helicopter with Red Cross markings hovering very low over demonstrators, possibly in an effort to disperse the crowds. The use of a medical helicopter in a law enforcement capacity may violate military law and regulations. “Our priority is the safety of our Guardsmen who support civil authorities,” the DCNG said in a tweet. “We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of citizens and their right to protest.” 12:04 a.m.: Amid protests over racial injustice, Ferguson, the site of the shooting of Michael Brown, elects first African American mayor The city of Ferguson, the site of 2014 unrest and protests over racial justice after Michael Brown, an 18-year old black man, was killed by a white police officer, elected its first African American mayor Tuesday, Ella Jones. Jones, a councilwoman in the predominantly black city, is also the first woman to hold the position, according to the St. Louis Dispatch. She will succeed James Knowles III, a term-limited white, Republican mayor who defeated Jones in 2017. This year, Jones defeated another councilwoman, Heather Robinett, by six points, according to unofficial results from county election officials. 10:39 p.m.: Trump objects to GOP criticism of church photo op President Donald Trump lashed out at fellow Republicans who have criticized his decision to clear protesters out of Lafayette Park Monday evening prior to a photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church. He called out Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who were all critical of the violent removal of peaceful protesters with flashbangs and smoke canisters. “You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before?” he tweeted, though it was a different group of protesters and Monday’s group had not been violent. “People liked my walk to this historic place of worship!

Protesters first marched from Monument Circle to the City-County Building, exercising their right to protest while others exercised their right to vote. Eight minutes and 46 seconds, that’s how long people stayed on the ground to mark the time George Floyd was on the ground with a Minneapolis police officer’s knee on his neck. Floyd later died. From there, the protest moved to the statehouse. Hundreds of protesters chanted as dozens of Indiana State Police, some with face masks and batons, stood on the steps of the Statehouse with the National Guard there too. “It might have a chance to change the attitude of the system, but it’s going to take collectively working together, no matter what we do, for the just cause of stop killing black people,” Jones said. That’s why people of all different backgrounds have come out to protest. Jones said he was thankful for the diverse support. “I have to say to the Black Community, we need to participate. We need to educate our young people to understand the struggle is not over,” Jones said.

And there are curfews in other communities, and we certainly don’t want to create a vacuum for people to come here when there’s a curfew in another area.” He went on to say that if you needed to be out during the curfew because of work or another emergency, the ""curfew's not for you."" Instead, ""it's for the lawless people that would wreak havoc in the community."" Sheriff Judd also had a stern message for anyone who might come to the county to riot, loot, or injure people. ""I would tell them if you value your life, you probably shouldn’t do that in Polk County, because the people of Polk County like guns, they have guns, and I encourage them to own guns, and they’re going to be in their homes tonight with their guns loaded. And if you try to break into their homes, to steal, to set fires, I’m highly recommending they blow you back out of their house with their guns. So leave the community alone, and we’ll do our best to support the community."" Watch the full press conference here:",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. “We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,” he said. “It is time to pull people together.” Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John’s Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn’t mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn't comment about Trump's actions. “Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,” he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. “Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn’t mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,” Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn’t be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.” He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday. The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for how to deploy active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation’s capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. RELATED: 'I am outraged': DC Episcopal bishop condemns Trump church visit The protests have sprung up across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown on the protesters followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. He moved to respond aggressively Monday. In an evening address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence in their states to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t abide by those orders, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” Trump’s Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event. It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. ___ Lemire reported from New York and LaPorta reported from Delray Beach, Florida.

Bush releases rare public statement on George Floyd protests,https://www.wimsradio.com/2020/06/03/george-w-bush-releases-rare-public-statement-on-george-floyd-protests-2/,en,False,police,137718,wimsradio.com,http://wimsradio.com/,"George W. Bush releases rare public statement on George Floyd protests Richard Rodriguez/Getty ImagesBy LAUREN KING, ABC News (NEW YORK) — In a rare public statement, former President George W. Bush said he and former first lady Laura Bush were anguished by the killing of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear. “Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures — and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths,” the statement said. In a video that went viral, a Minneapolis police officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, pinned Floyd to the ground on Memorial Day after apprehending him outside a convenience store for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. As his knee was on Floyd’s neck for nearly 10 minutes, Floyd could be heard saying, “I can’t breathe.” Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder. All four officers involved have been fired and investigations are ongoing. Protests that began in Minnesota have multiplied across the country and around the world. While many have featured peaceful demonstrators marching — sometimes with police officers — some have grown violent and destructive, prompting cities to establish curfews and governors to call up the National Guard. On Monday, as protesters in Lafayette Park next to the White House were being cleared from the area, President Donald Trump came to the Rose Garden to call himself the “law and order” president, saying “domestic terrorism” was to blame for the unrest. “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,” he said. “We will end it now.” Earlier that day, he also called on governors to use their National Guard military police units to “dominate the streets” and threatened to deploy the active duty military if governors failed to use the National Guard more forcefully. In his five-paragraph statement, Bush went on to talk about the “shocking failure” that many African Americans, especially young men, are harassed and threatened in the U.S. “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” Bush wrote. Former President Barack Obama published an essay Monday on Medium addressing the ongoing protests and how he thinks people can move forward. The “bottom line,” he wrote, is that “if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isn’t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.” The next moment in American history can be “a real turning point,” Obama wrote, if “we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action.” Bush wrote, “America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union.” “Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions,” he continued. “We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all.” “This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way,” Bush concluded.

They left Monument Circle around 8:15 p.m. and took a roundabout route before entering the park at New York and Meridian streets shortly before 10 p.m., almost an hour after the curfew went into effect. They gathered at the fountain between the federal courthouse and the Indiana World War Memorial to read a list of demands. They announced they were going home for the night around 10:15 p.m. Malik Muhammad has been the leader of many of the peaceful marches. He told News 8 he is working hard to keep them that way. “My thought processes was in case they do anything, our best bet was getting closer to the outskirts of the city so that we have view from the apartments and the colleges and we have the ability to not be boxed in as easily and be able to disperse into surrounding neighborhoods.” IMPD officers trailed the protesters throughout their route and even served as crowd control to block several major intersections. News 8 spoke with Muhammad after the march was over. He was the same man who negotiated with police outside the Governor’s Residence on Monday night, then walked arm-in-arm with an IMPD Lieutenant. Muhammad said that one night of solidarity with the protesters isn’t enough, and will not pacify them. Instead, according to Muhammad, protesters will be out every night and their First Amendment rights will not be limited. “We will protest when we feel comfortable, when we feel comfortable. And that’s how that’s going to be and that’s how it’s going to continue to be until we get real systemic change,” according to Muhammad.

Craig Gore was dropped from NBC’s “Law & Order: Organized Crime” by franchise creator Dick Wolf. “I will not tolerate this conduct, especially during our hour of national grief. I am terminating Craig Gore immediately,” Wolf said in a statement. An attorney for Gore didn’t immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment. NBC declined to comment.

While some of the demonstrations were peaceful, others turned to looting and destruction, leaving many businesses wondering whether they will ever recover and reopen. Asif Raza, a Pakistani immigrant and the owner of Star Sub in Chicago, was among the small business owners targeted by the looting frenzy. “This looting has made it even harder for us. There was already very little business, so we are just trying to survive,” Raza told ABC News. Many of the small business owners interviewed by ABC News discussed the incredible hardships they experienced and the sacrifices they made to establish their businesses in the first place. In general, minority-owned businesses have faced additional challenges, beginning with securing bank loans and capital. A 2016 study by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research determined that startups by people of color report, on average, substantially higher levels of loan denials than their white counterparts. It is precisely because of such adversities and difficulties that Kareef Johnston, owner and manager of Shoe Mountain in Tampa, Florida, is particularly frustrated. “We started our retail store from humble beginnings selling clothing and shoes in 2004 out of the flea market in Tampa,” he told ABC News, adding that this continued until he was able to move to a store front plaza, and ultimately, to a new location in September 2019. “On Saturday, there was a protest to bring about change to not only our community but the entire world as it relates to police brutality, racial injustice and systemic racism. But as the night fell, those protesters became overshadowed by opportunists. Around 50 individuals rushed our black-owned small business that has been around for about 15 plus years, destroying and taking over a few hundred thousand [dollars] in merchandise,” Johnston said. “We have to understand our black-owned business is exactly what we are protesting for: black ownership and black people creating institutions to provide and employ for our own, access to capital, elimination of redlining, desegregation, equality in all spaces and arenas,” he said. “We are not here to tell anyone how to grieve, but we believe the moment we allow selfish desires for material goods trump our purposeful and warranted rage it only contributes to the detriment of black owned business, this cannot be considered anything but a loss.” From all accounts, the economic impact of the coronavirus on small businesses has been substantial, with many generating little or no income because of stay-at-home orders. Although 74.9% of participants in a recent Census Bureau survey of small businesses said that they had applied for Small Business Administration emergency loans, funds which do not have to be repaid if they are utilized for rent, mortgage or payroll expenses, only 38.1% received aid. At the same time, many businesses, particularly those owned by minorities and women, have experienced great challenges when applying for loans. Although, under the CARES Act, money was set aside for them, a new report by the SBA’s inspector general determined that these businesses “may not have received the loans as intended,” because there was “no evidence” that the SBA had issued guidance to lenders about prioritizing minority borrowers. Hence, many were shut out given the overwhelming demand for the loans and the limits set by banks. Raphael Kim, owner of Gomi, a Korean wine bar in New York City, is disheartened, and told ABC News, “I really don’t know what the future of my business is.” During the shutdown, he said, “We have been doing 10% to 20% of what we normally would do. It’s just really, really even difficult to survive.” Between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Monday, the entire facade of his store was destroyed, and money was stolen from the cash register. Also in the early hours of Monday morning, Anna Barounis, a Greek immigrant, and the longtime owner of Giorgiana’s, a small neighborhood market and deli in Boston’s South End, saw on social media that her store was ransacked. Throughout the pandemic, she worked alone, because her employees were fearful of getting sick. According to Barounis, approximately 50 teenagers, carrying baseball bats and sledgehammers, looted and damaged the property. She has been told by investigators that they were likely from out of state. “I’ve never been so devastated,” Barounis told ABC News. “We were never vandalized like this ever in over 49 years, so it was really shocking.” Barounis said that the damage and valuables lost may add up to a “couple hundred thousand dollars,” and it will be several weeks until she can reopen her business. The anguish and pain is also evident in the voice of Jeff Zeitler, who with wife Gita, owns Urban Forage Winery & Cider House, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. “This is devastating. We were just planning to reopen, then we got looted, and the blocks around us got burned down — it is just terrible,” he said. The Zeitler family’s store was vandalized, with much destroyed inside, and much of the merchandise gone. During the pandemic, he says, the sales were down between 60% and 70%, but despite the setback, he and his wife were feeling optimistic, anticipating a recovery. Zeitler voiced his grief over the lack of a police presence in his area, feeling that from the onset of the demonstrations, “They have basically abandoned us. They left our area to be looted and burned.” He is now finding support within his neighborhood, as many residents and business owners have committed to guarding the buildings in the area to discourage more looting. Still, Zeitler feels quite vulnerable and unsure about the future. But, he told ABC News, “This is my dream. This is my dream. I desperately want to reopen.” Although the total number of businesses that were damaged during riots around the country remains uncounted, unofficial counts suggest that hundreds may have been impacted. Most of the small business owners ABC News spoke to said they are not sure if insurance will cover the destruction caused by the looting. For now, many have organized GoFundMe fundraisers to help pay for some of the damages. Copyright © 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",0.0

Beaty was one of two people fatally shot in Indianapolis during protests over the death of George Floyd.(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — To those who knew former Indiana University football player Chris Beaty, it was no surprise that he would participate in a protest over the death of George Floyd. That a man they saw as a “gentle giant” who brought positivity everywhere he went would turn up dead in an alley after a peaceful demonstration turned violent was unfathomable. “He promoted peace and understanding and love every way that he could,” said Michael Cranfill, a restaurant and craft beer taproom owner. “He is someone, I think, who would take every opportunity he could to bring people together.” Beaty’s body was found Saturday night not far from his apartment, one of two people fatally shot after violence erupted during an Indianapolis protest. The death of the man who was known as Mr. Indianapolis because of his unwavering support and enthusiasm for the city was just one of several in the U.S. during a week of protest and unrest since Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. Others slain include a Louisville, Kentucky, restaurant owner who was shot by authorities trying to disperse a crowd; a federal officer in Oakland, California, who was shot at a courthouse by someone in a passing vehicle; and a man shot outside a pawn shop in Minneapolis. Police in Indianapolis did not release details Tuesday of Beaty’s slaying. Arely Elrod said she met Beaty about a decade ago through mutual friends who would attend local events together. “He was so selfless and always so positive,” said Elrod, who owns a cleaning service. “He felt like there was always a need in a time of hatred. He was always the one to make sure he made a difference.” Beaty, 38, graduated from Indianapolis Cathedral High School and played defensive lineman at Indiana University from 2000 to 2004. Since then, he had become a business owner in Indianapolis. “The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” Indiana head football coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The school said Beaty had been president of Fresh Marketing LLC. A May 4 post on Beaty’s Facebook page said that he and his team had created a reusable and washable cloth facemask with a filter for people to use during the coronavirus pandemic. “As the realization that life is changing set in from sitting on the couch during quarantine, I figured out a way to be proactive and help people during these COVID-19 times,” the post read. “If you’re going back to work and looking for a solution to your ‘new normal’ please keep us in mind.” Beaty also owned and operated nightclubs and recently sold some of his businesses, said Cranfill, who added that when he opened his own restaurant in downtown Indianapolis Beaty asked how they could work together to grow the community. “He was a gentle giant, the kind of guy that would just draw you in with his energy,” said Cranfill, 37. “He had the most amazing smile, would give you a big hug. He exuded care for his community — someone who brought everyone together.” Cranfill called Beaty a leader, not just for African Americans in the community, but for all of Indianapolis. “I prayed and said, ‘Let his memory be the unifying moment to stop this violence, for us to come together, lay down our differences and for people to begin to heal and hear each other,'” Cranfill said.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) — A day after threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off his threat to deploy troops, with White House officials saying this week’s response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves. The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday. The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for how to deploy active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation’s capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. The protests have sprung up across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown on the protesters followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. He moved to respond aggressively Monday. In an evening address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence in their states to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t abide by those orders, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” Trump’s Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event. It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",0.0

But that response has also undermined America’s message on the world stage, leaving the U.S. open to attacks of hypocrisy from foreign adversaries or facing condemnation from key allies. For U.S. diplomats, it’s become a difficult position as they struggle to respond to protests at embassies overseas, criticism from local governments or press and their own emotions over the crisis back home after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. “As Americans, it is a difficult moment for all of us. Each of us should take the opportunity to reflect upon that tragedy (of Floyd’s death) and what we can do in our lives to both bring about healing and to address its underlying conditions and causes,” Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun wrote to all department staff Monday night in an email obtained by ABC News. In the week since the Minneapolis police officer asphyxiated Floyd with his knee — the latest in a long line of unarmed African Americans killed by police — some U.S. ambassadors have spoken out about the protests ricocheting across the U.S. and demanding racial justice. But their statements have been sneered at by adversaries like China and Iran, quick to highlight racial tensions in the U.S., and undermined by Trump’s actions, particularly after law enforcement used flash bangs, tear gas and force to remove peaceful protesters assembled across from the White House on Monday. The day after that clearing operation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Hong Kong’s government for barring a peaceful vigil for the anniversary of the China’s brutal crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing. For the first time in 30 years, a permit for the annual demonstration was rejected, with officials citing restrictions because of the coronavirus. Pompeo blasted that as Beijing moving “to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems.” Online and overseas, he has been challenged by critics condemning the Trump administration’s assault on the peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing chief executive Carrie Lam condemned what she called a “double standard” from senior U.S. officials, saying during a press conference, “They take their own country’s national security very seriously, but for the security of our country, especially the situation in Hong Kong, they are looking at it through tinted glasses.” “Your boss gassed peaceful Americans exercising their 1st Amendment rights yesterday for a photo op. You’re a disgrace,” Jennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist with the Washington Post, tweeted at Pompeo. Unlike his deputy Biegun, Pompeo has not sent a department-wide email about the tumult in the country. Biegun’s note, which encouraged senior officials to lead dialogues about racial issues with their staff and asked all employees to complete an unconscious bias training course, said he and Pompeo “recognize this has been an extraordinary time in history, and a challenging time for you and your families,” although it’s signed by Biegun alone. When law enforcement cleared Lafayette Park Monday, police were seen on camera by ABC News affiliate WJLA-TV assaulting two Australian journalists, hitting a cameraman in the chest with a shield and a television correspondent in the back with a club. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne expressed “strong concerns” about the incident, and Australia’s ambassador to the U.S. Arthur Sinodinos said the State Department is assisting the embassy in filing a complaint with the appropriate authorities and requesting an investigation. In his own statement, the U.S. ambassador to Australia Arthur Culvahouse did not apologize for the incident or comment on it directly. “Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously. … We remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting journalists and guaranteeing equal justice under law for all,” the statement said. Outside the U.S. embassies in London, Dublin, Berlin and Paris in recent days, hundreds of demonstrators have marched in solidarity with U.S. protesters. The European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Tuesday that Floyd’s death was an “abuse of power” by law enforcement and warned “against the excessive use of force.” At least one U.S. envoy has spoken out to defend Trump’s actions on Monday. Ambassador Jim Gilmore, the U.S. permanent representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Tuesday that “local law enforcement, supported by their governors and local authorities,” had an “obligation … to restore order in their communities.” “The President has vowed to take swift and decisive action and he has called upon governors to do the same,” said Gilmore, the former Republican governor of Virginia and chair of the Republican National Committee. He added that protesters have a right to march, but, “those who break the law through acts of arson and looting, however, must be arrested and held accountable for their transgressions.” Other ambassadors, particularly those career diplomats in the Foreign Service, have voiced support for the protests. U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe Brian Nichols released a statement Monday that candidly spoke about his pain and anger at Floyd’s killing, writing, “As an African American, for as long as I can remember I have known that my rights and my body were not fully my own. … In a long, unbroken line of black men and women, George Floyd gave the last full measure of devotion to point us toward a new birth in freedom.” But Nichols rejected the idea that U.S. officials can’t speak out against injustices, at home or abroad. “I have also always known that America, conceived in liberty, has always aspired to be better — a shining city on a hill — and that is why I have dedicated my life to her service,” he said. “Americans will continue to speak out for justice whether at home or abroad. We can meet the ideals of our founding, we will change this world for the better.” Nichols was summoned by the Zimbabwean government Monday to protest comments Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien made to ABC’s This Week Sunday. O’Brien labeled the southern African country as one of America’s “foreign adversaries” seeking to take advantage of the racial protests. Zimbabwean Minister of Information Nick Mangwana rejected that, tweeting, “Zimbabwe does not consider itself America’s adversary. We prefer having friends and allies to having unhelpful adversity with any other nation including the USA.” Asked what O’Brien was basing that on, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News Monday, “We remain deeply troubled by the Zimbabwean government’s use of violence against peaceful protestors and members of civil society, as well as against labor leaders and opposition leaders in Zimbabwe. The Government of Zimbabwe has not arrested a single person in connection with any abduction since 2018, nor has it investigated and held accountable those responsible for human rights violations and abuses.” U.S. diplomats in Africa seem particularly outspoken about the issue of these racial protests across the U.S., as they compete with strong Chinese influence and growing Russian involvement across the continent and battle the perception that Trump, who referred to its 54 nations as “s—hole countries,” and his administration do not care about Africa. The U.S. embassies in Kenya and Uganda tweeted that they are “deeply troubled” by Floyd’s death and that there should be a “full investigation.” The embassy in Tanzania also shared the Department of Justice’s statement announcing its probe into what happened. U.S. ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo Mike Hammer had a more personal message Friday, tweeting in French that he was “deeply disturbed by the tragic death of George Floyd” and that the Justice Department will conduct a thorough investigation. “Law enforcement must be held accountable worldwide. No one is above the law,” he added. That has been a common theme in many embassies’ messages, as U.S. diplomats seek to promote the rule of law in their host countries. “The U.S. stands for human rights & freedoms for all, as enshrined in our Constitution. We will not avert our eyes to injustice at home & abroad. We’ll support peaceful public assembly, constructive dialogue, rule of law, as we work toward a more peaceful, democratic world,” said Rebecca Ross, spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Hours earlier, Russia’s embassy in Washington condemned U.S. law enforcement’s “unacceptable” use of rubber bullets and tear gas against personnel from state-run Sputnik news agency, even though Russian police similarly used batons and force to beat back protesters in Moscow last year.
