(Photo by Kiffer Creveling | The Daily Utah Chronicle) On May 17, the Salt Lake Tribune published an article which described how Miguel Deras, a former University of Utah police officer assigned to Lauren McCluskey’s case, saved explicit images of her to his phone prior to her murder. He also showed the images to a male colleague and bragged about “getting to look at them whenever he wanted,” according to the article. The independent review conducted shortly after McCluskey’s death revealed several issues in the handling of the case by the University of Utah Department of Public Safety, according to the review’s report. McCluskey’s parents responded to the case’s newest developments in a press conference the day after the Tribune’s article was published. Jill McCluskey, McCluskey’s mother, said she expected Deras to arrest the man who had been stalking and blackmailing her daughter after she provided evidence against him. “The only thing officer Deras did was download the photos she provided as evidence to his personal phone for his own enjoyment,” she said. The recent reveal of information was met with instant outrage from students and a demand from citizens and students alike to get Officer Meras fired. A petition was started to ‘Fire and Press Charges against Miguel Deras for Distributing Lauren McCluskey’s Photos’ and has received over 88,000 signatures. The Logan Police Department, where Meras is currently employed, announced they have opened an investigation into the officer, but the department has not announced further action. Unsafe U, an independent organization that seeks to raise awareness of safety issues at the U, wrote in an Instagram post that they have demanded the U create an independent board to investigate and recommend actions in cases such as these. “We need to be able to trust that when we reach out for help, our own police force is not going to further harm us,” the caption said. The post had 50 comments from students and all were upset and disappointed about the developments. User @aubreypsb commented, “@universityofutah I am ASHAMED TO CALL MYSELF AN ALUMNI RIGHT NOW. This is absolutely sickening.” On May 23, the University of Utah Students for a Democratic Society held a car protest in response to the news about the mishandled photos. The protest took place outside of the gated community where U President Ruth Watkins lives. Bryn Dayton, a member of SDS, said that the group is focusing on the lack of accountability from both the police department and the university. “We only know about this because the Salt Lake Tribune has been putting in requests for information. It’s upsetting and it makes me angry, and everybody in SDS is just disgusted,” Dayton said. Dayton said that the newest aspect of the case shows that there’s a systemic problem of misogyny in the police department and that SDS is committed to fighting against establishing an auxiliary police station in the Union. In February 2020, it was proposed by ASUU that the U build a place for the University Police Department to exist within the A. Ray Olpin Union. “SDS does not feel it appropriate to have a police station where the Center for Ethnic Student Affairs is housed, where the LGBT Resource Center is housed and where the Women’s Resource Center is housed. The police are systemically racist, anti-women, homophobic and transphobic. We cannot have an auxiliary station in the Union that is for students,” Dayton said. Ashley Merrell, an undergraduate student studying physics, said that the university should be hiring officers who show empathy and who want to keep students safe, since students are an especially vulnerable population. She was heartbroken, disappointed and ashamed when she found out about the mishandled photos. “I don’t trust officers … I don’t see any reason why I should be putting my trust in them,” Merrell said. In response to the article released by the Tribune, a graduate student who preferred to remain anonymous said that she felt embarrassed to be affiliated with the U, and that she has no faith in the university administration, university police force and Utah state police in general. They felt angry that administrators have failed to take accountability and address the underlying issue of sexism. “The fact that someone thought it was ‘okay’ for him to save Lauren’s photos and then share them with coworkers, and had co-workers who didn’t say one word or report him, goes to show the culture that is present within many organizations, like the U police department, condones sexism, racism, homophobia, etc.,” the student said. Additionally, Erin Johnston, a recent graduate of the U, is entering her PhD at the U in the fall. She said she identifies herself as a member of the chemistry department before identifying as a Ute because of the deep sadness she feels for the mishandling of McCluskey’s case. “It was clear that the time to take action against the officer’s behavior had long since passed, and that felt like insult to injury,” Johnston said. She also felt that McCluskey’s murder had many layers, including systemic abuse of police authority, pervasive presence of white nationalists on campus that ascribe the murder to an issue of race, and money and reputation. In a statement released May 18, University of Utah Police Chief Rodney Chatman said that the allegations are “an especially egregious offense on a college campus where young women are already reluctant to report sexual assault to police for fear of not being believed or no action being taken if they report a crime.” Chatman has also ordered a new independent investigation into the case. The investigation will be conducted by officials from the Utah Department of Public Safety. [email protected] @meganbmckellar",0.0

The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA.

1617992054,2020-05-27 07:00:46,4 Minneapolis officers fired after video showed man pinned by neck,https://gephardtdaily.com/national-international/4-minneapolis-officers-fired-after-video-showed-man-pinned-by-neck/,en,False,,307157,gephardtdaily.com,http://gephardtdaily.com/,"May 27 (UPI) — The Minneapolis Police Department fired four officers Tuesday in response to a video appearing to show one officer keeping his knee on the neck of a handcuffed man who later died. Activists and the family of the deceased man, George Floyd, who was black, have decried the police use of force as racially motivated. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings in a news conference. “This is the right call,” Frey tweeted. “Being black in America should not be a death sentence,” he said. “For 5 minutes we watched as a white officer pressed his knee to the neck of a black man, for 5 minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help, this officer failed in the most basic human sense.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo told reporters he would cooperate fully as the investigation proceeds and the department will have its own internal investigation. He added that based on additional information he received, he called in federal authorities to conduct a probe because he’s concerned about possible civil rights violations. Frey said during the press conference that he understands that people are angry and have the right to protest, but urged caution and continued social distancing because of the coronavirus pandemic. Floyd’s arrest happened near a Cup Foods at the intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th Street on Monday. Police were called to investigate a report of someone trying to pay with a counterfeit bill at the grocery store and found a man matching the suspect’s description on the hood of his car, according to police and scanner audio posted online. Police spokesman John Elder said officers took Floyd into custody after he “physically resisted,” adding that their body cameras were turned on and the way he was held was not a department-authorized chokehold. “In my years as an officer, that would not be what I would ever consider a chokehold,” Elder said. Elder could not comment on whether Floyd, thought to have been in his 40s, had any pre-existing medical conditions, but said that he appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or a narcotic. He also said that an ambulance was called after officers handcuffed him and noticed he was in “medical distress.” A police statement released shortly after the incident said Floyd died Monday night at a nearby hospital shortly after his arrest, but bystanders were skeptical of the police account. In the video, bystanders can be heard pleading with the officer to take his knee off Floyd’s neck. Officers have not released the name of the officer who is shown pinning down Floyd in the video or other officers involved. NBC News reported that Darnella Frazier was one of the people who filmed the incident. “The man looked already dead before the ambulance even got there,” Frazier told NBC News. “He was clearly trying to tell them he couldn’t breathe and they ignored him.” A bystander streamed the footage on Facebook Live, and the archived footage has been watched tens of thousands of times. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a local activist, said watching the video reminded her of the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who died after a New York police officer put him in a chokehold. “It just reminds me of Eric Garner once again: a black man being accosted by police and pleading for his life saying he couldn’t breathe,” Levy-Armstrong said. A grand jury decided against indicting officers in the Garner case, resulting in widespread protests.",0.0

Conventional wisdom argues they have limited electoral impact. But a vice-presidential pick does matter in a particular way to elections. It suggests the strategy and tactics a campaign will pursue. The pick might complement the ticket, like Al Gore did for Bill Clinton in 1992, or the pick might balance the ticket, like Mike Pence did for Donald Trump. So Joe Biden’s electoral fate may well hinge on this decision. In our polarized era, where turnout determines election victors and each party’s coalition has become more locked in, ticket-balancing picks for vice president can be helpful in mending primary wounds and generating excitement for the coalition in the general election. That is why Mr. Biden should select for his running mate a ticket balancer. Now, the temptation for Mr. Biden to pick a ticket “complementer” will be high. All the conventional wisdom suggests that ticket complementers “do no harm” because they are, essentially, prototypes of the presidential nominee. By contrast, ticket balancers offer voters something the main nominee lacks and often are meant to motivate a group within the coalition with which the nominee has struggled to gain traction. Balancers are perceived to be riskier, especially since John McCain’s selection of Sarah Palin in 2008. Hillary Clinton is often castigated as running a terrible, horrible, no good, doomed campaign. She actually ran a perfectly fine campaign — but strategically speaking, it was the wrong kind of campaign. It was based on the flawed assumption that a significant portion of American conservatives would not, simply could not, vote for Donald Trump. But on Election Day, 90 percent of Republicans voted for him; Mrs. Clinton also failed to carry independents, despite a campaign structured mostly on winning them over. Mrs. Clinton’s “do no harm” pick — Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia — ended up doing her considerable harm. The strategy built around the pick ended up leaving the party’s progressive flank vulnerable to, among other things, a sophisticated Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign. In addition, so-called protest balloting in 2016 was three to five times higher than normal in the swing states. In states like Wisconsin, which was decided by less than a percentage point, nearly 6 percent of the electorate cast protest ballots. For all the attention placed on white, working-class voters and their continued realignment away from Democrats, protest balloting affected the outcome of every swing state contest and played a pivotal role in Mr. Trump’s destruction of the Democrat’s Midwest “blue wall.” Yet Mr. Trump still has a plurality problem, and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, knows it. Even before the pandemic came along to destroy his best argument for re-election, the economy, Mr. Trump was unpopular among independents and has hardly ever (aside from a brief moment early in the coronavirus crisis) hit 50 percent approval rating nationally and rarely in swing states. Article continues below The only way to re-elect a plurality president is to make a plurality vote share sufficient enough to win. And the best way to do that is to replicate Russia’s playbook of targeting parts of the Democratic coalition — like progressives and young black voters — to turn them against voting for Mr. Biden. The only person who has as much riding on Mr. Biden’s decision is Mr. Trump. As in 2016, he hopes to pick off or discourage disgruntled progressive voters. Much of Mr. Trump’s re-election hopes are pinned on Mr. Biden making the wrong choice of running mate. So the Biden team must make a pick that can help Democrats match what promises to be an energized Republican base. The best way to do that is a ticket-balancing candidate like Stacey Abrams or Kamala Harris. They would bring gender and racial diversity to the ticket and, perhaps even more important, ideological diversity. That might prove to be the single most effective way to head off the Trump campaign’s “divide and conquer” plan for progressives in 2020. With 120 million millennials and Generation Z potential voters now powering their coalition, Democrats would be wise to recognize that their electoral fate hinges on getting these voters to the polls. Mr. Biden is positioning himself as a bridge to the party’s future — and liberals like Ms. Harris and Ms. Abrams would help pave the way. Another ticket-balancing approach would be to put a down payment on the Democratic Party’s geographic future. This approach would focus resources not as much on the Midwest but on Sunbelt states from California to Georgia through Texas, which could rise as a potential swing state as early as 2024. This would have the Biden team looking at Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Latina governor of New Mexico, or at Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada as potential running mates. Mr. Biden’s nomination maxes out the ticket’s appeal to the center of the electorate. Among independents, the pandemic, economic collapse and Mr. Trump’s antics already provide Mr. Biden a hard edge. A centrist, ticket-complementing pick like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will likely bring diminishing returns in this regard. As a fellow white moderate, Ms. Klobuchar is a quintessential ticket complementor — a 2020 version of Mr. Kaine. If Mr. Biden is going to ignore the fact that today’s Democratic Party represents the most racially diverse coalition in America’s history, he should at least look to a ticket balancer like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who would bring ideological diversity and guarantee robust turnout and loyal support among progressives, many of whom are independents. The special election last week in California’s 25th District shows Democrats are still vulnerable to low turnout; when their coalition fails to turn out, they lose. It also dispelled a dangerous myth — suburban Republicans are not casting ballots for Democrats. If Democrats want to hold on to or even expand on their House gains from 2018 and potentially take control of the Senate, they need an excited electorate. Election outcomes in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona all come down to the same thing: the percentage of Democrats and left-leaning independents that end up casting ballots compared with the percentage of Republicans and right-leaning independents that do so. Republicans understand this campaign math and learned to solve this equation a long time ago. The only question is, have Democrats finally solved it too?",0.0

The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable.

The mayor urged Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to file charges against the officer, whom the city identified as Derek Chauvin. In a video taken by a witness, Chauvin can be seen kneeling and putting pressure on the neck of George Floyd, who struggled and said he couldn’t breathe. Police called an ambulance for Floyd after he became unconscious. He later died at the hospital. The Minneapolis Police Department fired Chauvin and three other officers involved in the arrest — J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” Frey asked during a news conference Wednesday. “If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now and I cannot come up with an answer to that question.” The mayor said his call for charges agains Chauvin is based on the footage from the scene. “We watched for 5 whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed handcuffed black man. I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” Frey said Chauvin’s use of force was not a technique authorized by the police department’s training. The mayor’s news conference comes the morning after protests over Floyd’s death broke out in Minneapolis on Tuesday night, leading to some violence. Thousands of protests gathered at the site of Floyd’s arrest, chanting “I can’t breathe” and calling for the officer involved to be charged and convicted. The group marched toward the 3rd Precinct location and WCCO-TV reported that a smaller group began vandalizing the police building and cars. Police responded in riot gear, setting off tear gas and flash grenades in an attempt to disperse the crowd. Some protesters responded by throwing water bottles and rocks at the officers. Some non-violent protesters said they were injured in the violence. “I got on my knees and I put up a peace sign and they tear gassed me,” one protester told WCCO. “And I said, ‘Tear gas me again because non-violence seems healing.'”",0.0
1618590680,2020-05-27 23:47:09,Mayor: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/5/27/21272846/george-floyd-derek-chauvin-minneapolis-minnesota-protestors-police,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"MINNEAPOLIS — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights” and called for their immediate release. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

The African-American Floyd died Monday after he was restrained by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a grocery store. Video of Floyd’s arrest, in which he is heard telling officers he can’t breathe, spawned immediate shock and civil unrest in Minneapolis that later spread to other cities nationwide Wednesday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office said Thursday they’re conducting “a robust” criminal investigation.” “The Department of Justice has made the investigation a top priority and has assigned experienced prosecutors and FBI criminal investigators to the matter,” they said. In Southern California, hundreds of demonstrators organized by Black Lives Matter-LA marched in downtown Los Angeles and at one point blocked a freeway. Some protesters vandalized a California Highway Patrol car by smashing its rear window. The demonstration ultimately drew an angry crowd outside of the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. In Tennessee, dozens of protesters gathered outside police department headquarters in Memphis and engaged in verbal confrontations with several dozen officers and a couple counter-protesters. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for the arrest of the officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck during the confrontation.

Women Deserve Equal Rights If you were a girl, how would you feel if you did not have the same rights as the boys? In the late 1800's people believed that women were good for cleaning, cooking, and taking care of children. Many believed they did not deserve the right to vote. Women disagreed, and fought for equal rights. To begin, heroes are created for doing many amazing things. Who was Seraph Young? She was a hero to women across the United States! She was the first woman to have the opportunity to vote in the United States. She was a 23 year old school teacher from Salt Lake City, Utah. After years were spent with women fighting for the right to vote she was finally given that opportunity in 1870. Her decision to stop and vote on her way to work that day impacted women for years to come. Even today as I watched a video of women earning the right to vote I felt empowered by her choice. Additionally, as I watched and listened to all the things many women did, including Seraph Young, to be able to finally vote, I imagined how hard it must have been for them. I could feel their frustration and anger. Why were women being treated differently than men? Why weren't we all just seen as people? It allowed me to empathize with black people who also had to fight for equal rights. Men thought women weren't capable of doing the same things as them just as many people also believed black people weren't worthy or capable of doing such things. It makes me feel sad, mad, and frustrated for all of them. I am grateful that today most people do believe that women and men, black or white, are just people and should be treated equally. Finally, if given the opportunity, I would love to meet Seraph Young and the other women who fought so hard for me to have the right to vote when I turn 18. If I had been alive during that time I think I would have been marching and protesting for equal rights not only as a woman but I would have marched for equal rights for all people. I admire people like Martin Luther King and Alice Paul who never gave up on what they believed in no matter the cost or how hard it was. I hope no matter what happens in my life that I always stand up for what I believe is right. As you can see, heroes come in many forms. They don't always wear a cape but they do leave a lasting impression on all those around them. I am grateful for all the women before me who sacrificed so much so that I can have the life I do as a young woman and future adult. I'm grateful I can become anything I want to be and there isn't anyone who can stop me.

Women’s Suffrage In 1920, the 19th Amendment finally gave women the right to vote. I already knew a little about Women’s Suffrage but I was still very surprised by the new information that came from the video. My biggest surprise was the great lengths that some courageous people went to for their right to vote. One of these extreme measures was going on a hunger strike. The most common way to go on strike would be to stop working until your wages went up. In this case, however, a hunger strike meant to stop eating while in captivity (jail) until a wrong has been righted. Alice Paul, along with other suffragists, protested by being “Silent Sentinels”. This means that all of their protests were strong but silent and peaceful. Even though they caused no harm, they were still all sent to jail. There, Alice Paul started a hunger strike. During this, she was transferred into a psychiatric unit because they thought she was crazy for going to such lengths. There, she was force fed raw eggs through a tube in order to avoid possible death. This made me wonder, did other women go through this same thing to help their cause? In further research I found that they have. If a woman went into a hunger strike, she would most likely be force fed a mixture of bread and water by a tube going up her nose, down her throat, and into her stomach. The main purpose of Alice Paul’s hunger strike was to bring to attention the horrible conditions at the prison. She wanted people to know that just because of peaceful protesting she was being treated just like a criminal. She had committed no crime! She just wanted to have a vote and voice in the nation. Another person that intrigued me during this era was a woman named Elizabeth Caddy Stanton. In 1840, at age 25, she was nominated for the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. However, as she arrived she was told that the male delegates had voted not to allow the women to participate in the event. She and others had to sit in a roped-off section where they couldn’t be seen or heard. This was sad for Elizabeth and she later wrote, “My experience at the World Anti-Slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere swept across my soul, intensified now by my personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements conspired to compel to some onward step. I could not see what to do or where to begin. My only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion.” Many people at this time had wanted to speak up but she was one of the first to truly act on it. In 1848, she put together the first Women’s Rights Convention in New York. Once one convention was held, women all over the country started meeting together to brainstorm ideas on how to convince the public to help their cause. These “ideas” included parades, speaking tours, and petitions. Fueled by one person's courage to speak out, the whole country became more united in protests. This showed me that everyone’s thoughts count. Big or small, everyone can do something. A man that was inspiring to me during this era went by the name of Harry Burn. He was only 24 years old at the time and was the youngest member of the Tennessee Legislature during the passing of the 19th Amendment. For an amendment to be passed it needs to be ratified by 2⁄3 of the states. The last state needed to ratify the new amendment was Tennessee. However, Tennessee was deadlocked in a tie. As the legislature voted again the next day to break the tie, something extraordinary happened. Harry Burn came intending to vote no to the amendment but paused to read a note from his mother before the vote. It read, “Dear son, hurray for the vote for suffrage!” They voted again and this time under immense pressure, he said yes. Due to the courage of one man, Harry Burn, about 26 million women were suddenly able to vote in the election of 1920 and from then on. I just loved listening to these stories and learning what brave individuals did to change the Constitution for the better. It’s amazing to think that these people weren’t heroes, they were just ordinary people wanting to make a difference. It’s also encouraging to know that the things that aren’t right in the world don’t have to stay that way. Their example doesn’t have to be a thing of the past. We can be courageous today, and together we can change the world for the better. High School: Jenna Campbell Jenna is a junior at Ridgeline High School.

Throughout history, women have frequently been regulated to a supporting role. Many historians have noted the lack of women throughout the story of humanity. There seems to have been an abundance of critically important men turning the wheels of civilization: the Caesars, Gutenburgs, Columbuses, and Einsteins of the world. However, for making up half of the global population, women seemed to have a remarkably minuscule role in the development of the world as we know it. For thousands of years, the voices of decisive women have all but been silenced completely. One needs to look no further for examples of the suppressed role of women than many famous works of literature, such as the novel Frankenstein. In the novel, it is clear that women are almost entirely the property of the men in their lives. For example, a female character is given to another character, Victor Frankenstein, as a “pretty present,” as if she were nothing but an unfeeling object. This instance clearly demonstrated the perceived inferiority of women, apparently incapable of taking care of themselves. Likewise, women often had unrealistic and confining expectations of their behavior, desires, and interests forced upon them. However, women have not always accepted the expectation of their carefully controlled existence. This year marks the centennial celebration of the passage of the 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote in the United States. Women’s suffrage was the result of generations of women steadfastly pushing for equality. However, despite the efforts of these valiant women, the fight for both universal suffrage and equal rights is not over. Historically, the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 is credited with beginning the Women’s suffrage movement in the United States, but few realize how truly significant the event was. At the time, America adhered to the global characterization of women. A woman was expected to be quiet, obedient, and contentedly focused entirely on her home as her sole sphere of influence. The men would be the ones to handle politics and other “important matters” women were viewed as too fragile to manage. Despite this, the convention controversially proclaimed in the famous Declaration of Sentiments that “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal,” and demanded that women be granted the right to vote. While the 19th amendment wouldn’t be signed and ratified for another 70 years, this historic convention was a key event as it marked the being of the struggle for equality. In the years after the Seneca Falls Convention, prominent leaders rose up as a voice for the millions of women that had previously been silenced. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, and others courageously led the charge. The fight for women’s suffrage was called a “fight” for a reason, however, suffragists were rejected, persecuted, and ignored at nearly every step of the way. However, these unflinching women refused to back down, realizing that the cost was overwhelmingly outweighed by the potential reward. The suffragists endured open attack, ridicule, and other hardships, but decades of effort and protest would come to fruition on August 18, 1920, when the 19th amendment was passed. Women across the nation celebrated but realized that their work was far from finished. By 1923, Alice Paul, a militant suffragist, pushed for the passage of an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, realizing that having the vote did not necessarily mean equality for all. Yet this critical proposed amendment was brushed aside as it was considered to be too radical. Consequently, women gained suffrage, an essential step, but failed to achieve their true objective: equal rights for every American citizen. For the last century, women have been in a constant struggle to achieve equality. While the nation is presently closer than it ever has been before to the completion of this goal, there remain many obstacles to overcome. Many movements have developed throughout the last 100 years as women labor to be recognized for their contributions and to be adequately represented. The recent #MeToo movement and women’s marches have emerged as a direct consequence of the failure of society to give women the acknowledgment they deserve. Therefore, the continuation of the fight for equality is very much a cause worth standing up for.",0.0

Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday.

The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers.

On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted.

The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away.

The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice.

1619899797,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.kuer.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0
1620026803,2020-05-29 08:43:34,7 shot during Louisville protest over fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/5/29/21274399/louisville-protest-fatal-police-shooting-breonna-taylor,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door, the victim’s mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early Friday. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others, and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let’s make it happen, but safely.” Beshear, speaking on CNN, said the protest started peacefully but some people later “instigated and caused some actions that turned it into something that it should not have been.” The Democratic governor also called on President Donald Trump to retract a tweet in which he threatened to take military action to bring Minneapolis “under control.” The president, reacting to the torching of a Minneapolis police station by protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody, warned that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “I hope the president will retract that statement,” Beshear said. “During these times we can condemn violence while also trying to listen, to understand, to know that there is deep frustration, rightfully so, in our country. That there has not been enough action on creating equality, of opportunity and in health care. And in a time of this COVID-19 pandemic, it’s laid bare all of that.” Beshear added that elected officials have “a responsibility, not just to maintain the peace, which is what we ought to be doing, but to also listen, to show empathy, to try to find a way to move in the right direction, not the wrong one.” Louisville’s mayor also called for peace as he said two of the wounded from the gunfire in his city underwent surgery while five were in good condition. “I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a video posted to Twitter. Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. The protests quickly followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video he said was a message from Taylor’s family. Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

Tim Walz on Thursday signed an executive order activating the National Guard in response to protests over the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Walz said he issued the order at the request of local leaders who called on the state government for National Guard resources after “extensive damage to private property” occurred during the protests. “As governor, I will always defend the right to protest,” Walz said. “It is how we express pain, process tragedy and create change. That is why I am answering our local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.” In addition to the National Guard, approximately 200 Minnesota State Patrol troopers will be deployed along with state patrol helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to assist law enforcement officers on the ground. Floyd died Monday after he was restrained by a Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a grocery store. The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday it has made investigating his death a “top priority,” as protests have erupted nationwide to demand justice. Video of Floyd’s arrest, in which he is heard telling officers he can’t breathe, spawned immediate shock and civil unrest in Minneapolis that later spread to other cities nationwide Wednesday. Activists have said the use of force against Floyd — an African-American man — was racially motivated. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office said Thursday they’re conducting “a robust” criminal investigation.” “The Department of Justice has made the investigation a top priority and has assigned experienced prosecutors and FBI criminal investigators to the matter,” they said. In Southern California, hundreds of demonstrators organized by Black Lives Matter-LA marched in downtown Los Angeles and at one point blocked a freeway. Some protesters vandalized a California Highway Patrol car by smashing its rear window. The demonstration ultimately drew an angry crowd outside of the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. In Tennessee, dozens of protesters gathered outside police department headquarters in Memphis and engaged in verbal confrontations with several dozen officers and a couple counterprotesters. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for the arrest of Chauvin. The Minneapolis Police Department said it fired him and three other officers — J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao — who were involved. The Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd died was the site of more violence and looting Wednesday, with protesters throwing rocks at a local police precinct station and setting fire to buildings. A man was shot to death during the violence. Police said a man was in custody in connection with the incident. A survey on Thursday morning revealed extensive damage. A Wendy’s restaurant and an AutoZone auto parts store had been completely destroyed by fire, as had a pair of apartment buildings under construction nearby. A Target store and a grocery store had been looted while scores of other businesses in the area sustained property damage. “It’s like a war came through here last night,” store owner Julie Ingebretsen told Minnesota Public Radio. “It’s just destruction. And it makes me so sad, I can hardly stand it.” Philonise Floyd, George’s brother, called him “a gentle giant” who wouldn’t hurt anybody. “Knowing my brother is to love my brother,” he told CNN. A native of Houston, Floyd, 46, worked as a security guard at a Minneapolis bistro for five years before his death.",0.0
1620231198,2020-05-29 10:11:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.kuer.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

The protests stretched from nearby St. Paul, Minnesota, to cities across the country, as tensions flared over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who had pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck — a story that has captivated the country in recent days. Similar protests broke out in Louisville over the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot dead by white police officers who entered her home back in March, according to The New York Times. Seven people were shot in those protests. Trump’s response In response, President Donald Trump slammed “total lack of leadership” of Minnesota in a tweet. Trump wrote: “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter issued a warning for a second Trump tweet, which called the protesters “thugs.” Twitter said the tweet violated the social media platform’s rules for “glorifying violence.” What it looked like The Associated Press captured a number of photos from Thursday night’s protests.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that Derek Chauvin had been charged with third-degree murder in connection with Floyd’s Monday death. Floyd was pronounced dead after the arrest on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a grocery store. Video of the African-American man gasping for breath as the white police officer kneeled on the back of his neck for several minutes quickly circulated online, igniting a three-day wave of protests and rioting in the Twin Cities and elsewhere in the country. Chauvin was taken into custody earlier Friday by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Freeman said prosecutors were still reviewing the evidence and indicated there could be further charges brought against Chauvin. He and three other officers involved in Floyd’s death were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department shortly after the video was released. Freeman said investigations of the others were ongoing. “We felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator,” he said, adding that his office has never before brought murder charges within only a four-day time span. Among the evidence against Chauvin, he said, was the citizen’s video, the officers’ body cameras, witness statements, a preliminary medical examiner’s report and expert testimony. Minneapolis Council Member Andrea Jenkins told MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin worked together as security guards at the same Minneapolis restaurant for 17 years. “Officer Chauvin, he knew George for a very long time,” Jenkins said. Protests over Floyd’s death continued into the morning Friday after a third night of violence in Minneapolis, while similar disturbances broke out in Louisville and other parts of the country. Late Thursday, demonstrators set fire to a police precinct building in the neighborhood where Floyd died. The building had been evacuated by order of Mayor Jacob Frey, who said he was unwilling to endanger lives to protect the building. “I understand the importance of a precinct,” he said. “[But] the symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers, or the public. We could not risk serious injury to anyone and we will continue to patrol the third precinct entirely.” At 4:30 a.m. Friday, protesters and looters still were out on the streets in the neighborhood as several nearby commercial buildings burned unchecked. Firefighters arrived shortly afterward, accompanied by state police in riot gear, who began to arrest people in the area, including a CNN reporter and crew members. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and three crew members were taken into custody live on the air. The news organization immediately criticized the arrests and called for their release. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said later in the morning he “took full responsibility” for incident while issuing a “very public apology” to CNN. “There is no reason something like this should happen,” he said. The unrest also spread to neighboring St. Paul, where protesters looted a Target store and set fire to several businesses along a busy commercial corridor. Earlier in the night, National Guard troops were deployed in the two cities at Walz’s order. The governor said he issued the order at the request of local leaders who called on the state government for National Guard resources after “extensive damage to private property” occurred during the protests. At a press conference early Friday, Frey responded to President Donald Trump, who tweeted about the Minnesota protests. In the post, he called Frey “a very weak radical left mayor” and said, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter flagged Trump’s tweet as violating its rules and “glorifying violence.” “Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions,” Frey told reporters. “Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else, during a time of crisis. Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period? Yes. But you better be damn sure that we’re going to get through this.” Racially charged unrest over Floyd’s death and similar police brutality cases spread across the United States late Thursday. Protests occurred from coast to coast. In Louisville, Ky., seven people were shot during a protest over the shooting death of local resident Breonna Taylor during a March police raid. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in an early morning video message the shootings came from within the crowd. Five of those wounded were not seriously hurt, while two were sent into surgery and one was in critical condition. “No officers fired their weapons,” he said, thanking them for directing aid to the injured demonstrators “despite the risk to themselves.” The shots were fired around 11:30 p.m. as protesters gathered near the Louis D. Brandeis Hall of Justice. They were attempting to overturn a police prison transport vehicle before in the moments before the gunfire, video showed. In New York City, more than 70 people were arrested Thursday night as protesters broke COVID-19 lockdown rules to protest Floyd’s death. Five were charged with felonies for assaulting police officers — three of whom were injured in the melee — NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said, adding police will be ready for more protests Friday and over the weekend. “There will be a very large police presence there,” he said. “We expect that these will be peaceful, that people will express their outrage on the incident that happened in Minnesota, and rightly so. “But we’ll be out there to make sure we keep the peace. And if there are any agitators within the group, if we need to make that arrest, we’ll single that individual out, we’ll take him and allow the other peaceful protesters to go on.” In Columbus, Ohio, protests over Floyd’s death turned violent when some demonstrators began to throw objects at police. Officers responded by firing tear gas. Protesters later broke windows at the Ohio Statehouse and entered the building. Police tactical squads quickly responded. Widespread vandalism and property damage was reported in the city. As the weekend approached with the likelihood of more protests, the Mall of America in suburban Minneapolis announced it has delayed a planned partial reopening. “Out of an abundance of caution, given the significant unrest in the community, Mall of America has decided to postpone its planned June 1 reopening of retail stores,” Mall officials said in a website post, adding that curbside pick-up had also been suspended. “Our top priority is the safety of our tenants, their employees, and our team members; and restricting access to the building will allow us to do that,” they told NBC News. “By delaying our reopening date, it will give mall retailers additional time to prepare.”",0.0

Thousands of protesters marched through downtown Minneapolis past curfew and encircled a police precinct station. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, but some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Elsewhere in the city, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. It wasn’t clear if — or how — authorities would enforce the curfew amid sharp questions about how city and state leaders have handled the crisis. The restrictions came a night after protesters torched an abandoned police station. The renewed protests come the same day Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe as Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s curfew also will be in place Saturday, and nearby cities announced similar restrictions. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” Protests nationwide are fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to clashing with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. Later, the president said he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” Trump called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards there as recently as last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin served as an off-duty security guard at the El Nuevo Rodeo club for nearly two decades, and Floyd had worked there more recently for about a dozen events featuring African American music, Maya Santamaria told the AP. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was “overkill.” ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Park Record file photo The outdoor living room was ready this week and I tested it — with my young friends who are now full-time neighbors since last fall. I know they have been very diligent in their quarantine time because of a relative with cancer they needed to protect. We social-distanced in the garden which is just starting its trajectory toward fullness. Meaning — the seat cushions have been placed on the lawn furniture but the annual flowers and plants are mostly still in containers waiting to be planted. This week — because of the spectacular weather — I have returned to the garden and it feels so right and also somehow important. The birds that have frequented my yard for decades were mostly absent this winter and rightly so — there was no reason to stop by because I had stopped filling the feeders. I have a very large yard on a corner lot in an old neighborhood in Park Meadows — lower Park Meadows — so when I say large I mean relative to me maintaining it — not actual acreage. It has provided me and my little family with endless hours of space to dream and play games and porch-sit with neighbors and friends. So when I counted up over 30 bird feeders of all sizes and materials and capacities this past spring when I took them all down for a cleaning, I realized there was a very good reason it had been so very quiet at home all winter. I had not been an attentive or even dependable feeder. I had abandoned my responsibility. Which is a pretty fair way to look back on the last few time-warped months. I had hunkered down and in and tried to make sense of my indoor spaces (I am only a little over halfway there) and I communicated consistently with only a few very close friends. I didn’t have the space or the energy or the understanding to expand my circle. This week I tossed out the feeders that had not wintered well and I scrubbed the rest and let them dry in the sun — it seemed like the smart thing to do for the birds and myself. Then I filled them all with the seed that had been waiting all winter in the garage. Sunflower seeds and thistle don’t exactly age out. It didn’t take long before the alerts started. Not exactly birdsongs at first — more like pronouncements — hey guys there’s food over here. And then, by Day Two, more kids arrived and started singing. It was then I realized how seamlessly white and quiet the winter really had been for me. Support Local Journalism Donate  We were young and hopeful and idealistic and wanted to see immediate change in our great country. We thought we were woke and ready. We were neither.” My young friends sat side-by-side at the backyard table and I sat across from them and we talked about big things like climate change and corporate greed and the fact that Africa is a continent and not a country. We listened to some music, we ate some — not exactly elegant snacks that I made certain they saw me open safely and I let them pour from a bag of nuts so no one was putting their hands in a bowl. It is a new way to gather and I am certain we will all learn smart new patterns of engagement. Cupcakes for dessert because they come in their own little jackets and they are the perfect portion size (if you eat two). It was like the birdsongs restarting — these two young, smart, so-very-in-love humans asking questions and having answers and engaging with the old broad in a way that fed my heart. Right now the morning light is bright and tree leaves are spring green and vibrant. The hollyhocks that will be tall in weeks with bright flowers — right now — are just short green giant leafed bushes along the weathered wooden fence. There is a peaceful easy feeling here that I know is an illusion of my own making. But I need to feed on the green right now and on the light — because the summer ahead has darkness written all over it and for those of us of a certain age there is a cellular memory of race riots and political unrest of the late ’60s and the ’70s and which was such a violent time in America. We were young and hopeful and idealistic and wanted to see immediate change in our great country. We thought we were woke and ready. We were neither. But we were hopeful that change could come and some did. And some things got better. But not the systemic stuff. Living to see a good human — a black man become president in my lifetime was remarkable and he did this country proud and governed with grace and wisdom that belied his young years. And those eight years — while many of us were proud of the choices our leaders were making and we were held in esteem in the eyes of world leaders and we started to lift up — admittedly slowly — those who needed lifting, there was an abscess forming. It was fear-based and hate-filled and so ugly I can’t use any simple words to disguise it. There are folks among us who have been planning a level of civil unrest the likes of which we have never seen in this country. Adding to that pyre is the confusion and fear and resentment of spending months inside our homes and watching our country become increasing rudderless in terms of both real leadership and hope. I do not know what lies ahead. I know the times I have lived through before but this feels very, very different. I will need to keep the balance of the birds and hope of the garden wrapped tightly around me as we head into a revolution we should have anticipated. I will try to figure out how best I can be of service in the days ahead. There are about to be very, very different — these Sundays in the Parks… Teri Orr is a former editor of The Park Record.

1620539751,2020-05-29 19:34:50,"Police, experts condemn knee restraint used on George Floyd",https://www.abc4.com/news/national/police-experts-condemn-knee-restraint-used-on-george-floyd/,en,True,,130622,good4utah.com,http://good4utah.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Police around the nation and law enforcement experts on Thursday broadly condemned the way George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody this week, was restrained by an officer who dug his knee into the man’s neck, saying no circumstances warrant such a dangerous technique. Deeply disturbing video shot by a bystander shows Floyd handcuffed, lying on his stomach and seemingly subdued as the officer trying to arrest him pressed his knee down on Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes. Some police officials and experts said equally shocking was something not seen in the video: Other officers on the scene apparently did not try to intervene even as Floyd repeatedly cried out that he couldn’t breathe and moaned in pain. “Any officer who abuses their power or stands by and allows it to happen does not deserve to wear the badge, period,” Chicago Police Superintendent David O. Brown said. Related: Tennessee police chief’s tweet condemning police brutality goes viral Floyd, 46, was arrested Monday after an employee at a grocery store called police to accuse him of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. The cellphone video shows Floyd, who is black, face-down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, as officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, uses the knee restraint on his neck. Floyd’s head is turned to the side and he does not appear to be resisting. As the minutes tick by and Chauvin continues to hold him down, Floyd’s complaints about not being able to breathe stop as he falls silent and motionless. Toward the end of the video, paramedics arrive, lift a limp Floyd onto a stretcher and place him in an ambulance. “He wasn’t actively resisting, and he was saying he couldn’t breathe,” said Charles P. Stephenson, a former police officer and FBI agent with expertise in use-of-force tactics. “You have to understand that possibility is there (that Floyd couldn’t breathe), and you release any kind of restriction you might have on an airway immediately.” Chauvin and the three other responding officers have been fired, and the FBI is investigating whether they willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Chauvin has not spoken publicly, and his attorney has not responded to calls seeking comment. Police recruits learn a variety of use-of-force techniques at the academy, all with the idea that any force employed may equal but not exceed the physical resistance offered by a suspect. One technique is to restrain someone on the ground face-down, but officers are taught to press a part of the lower leg, such as the shin or top of the ankle, across the shoulders or the back. In some cases officers will “hog-tie” suspects’ legs to prevent flight or violent resistance. Related: 7 shot at Kentucky protest over fatal police shooting But “no police academy that we know of teaches a police officer to use their knee, to put it on their neck,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which researches and advises on police practices. “That’s just not taught because that can impact their breathing and their carotid artery (a crucial vessel that supplies blood to the brain). So when police look at that video, they are shocked that those tactics were used.” What’s more, officers are taught to get a suspect up from the ground as soon as possible, either sitting or standing, since lying on one’s stomach can cause breathing problems, especially for larger people. “If what we saw was a continuing, ongoing fight, I could see how a leg, for example, could slip to the back of the neck. But this is not what I’m seeing,” said John Bostain, a former officer and president of Command Presence, which trains police around the country. “I’m seeing a fight that appears to be over.” Floyd’s case and the recent shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have once again laid bare the divide between minority communities and law enforcement that grew to a nationwide uproar following the officer killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in 2014 and the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015, among others. Videos from bystanders and police cameras have helped elevate such cases to national scrutiny. Related: Minneapolis protest misinformation stokes racial tensions Law enforcement officials often ask that people reserve judgment in such cases until all facts — what transpired before or after what a video shows — are known. But the Floyd case has drawn swift and widespread condemnation. The Fraternal Order of Police, for example, issued a statement saying in part: “The fact that he was a suspect in custody is immaterial — police officers should at all times render aid to those who need it. Police officers need to treat all of our citizens with respect and understanding and should be held to the very highest standards for their conduct.” Law enforcement experts say tempers can flare when a suspect resists arrest, but it’s incumbent upon fellow officers with cooler heads to defuse the situation and put a stop to excessive force. But there’s no sign from the video that any of the officers at the scene with Chauvin tried to intervene. For some that had chilling echoes of the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991 despite the presence of a supervising officer. Related: ‘I can’t breathe’ a rally cry anew for police protests in US “That bothered me greatly,” said Stephenson, the use-of-force expert. “They all have an affirmative duty and obligation to uphold the law and uphold the procedures and to stop any violation of law or excessive use of force that they’re a witness to. … It didn’t look like those officers were making any effort to go over or say something or do anything.” LATEST NEWS STORIES:",0.0

The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards there as recently as last year, but it's not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin served as an off-duty security guard at the El Nuevo Rodeo club for nearly two decades, and Floyd had worked there more recently for about a dozen events featuring African American music, Maya Santamaria told the AP. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and a half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was ""overkill.""

Those cuts include reducing payments to foster families and money for domestic violence shelters. Plummeting tax revenues due to the coronavirus pandemic have forced lawmakers to find a way to cut up to $1.3 billion from the state’s budget for next fiscal year.

Gary Herbert issued an executive order Friday moving Grand County, West Valley City and Magna to the yellow or low risk phase of pandemic response. But Salt Lake City, Bluff and Mexican Hat are still in the orange — moderate risk level. The moves come as Utah health officials announced 343 new COVID-19 cases. That tops Thursday’s mark as the largest single day increase and brings the state to more than 9,200 cases. But Utah’s epidemiologist Angela Dunn said people shouldn’t jump to conclusions because “one day does not make a trend.” Dunn partially attributed the rise to more tests this week after a lull over Memorial Day weekend and to possible localized outbreaks, like in a veteran’s nursing home. So far, nearly 206,000 people have been tested. And just over 5,800 are estimated to have recovered. — Ross Terrell Follow KUER’s coverage of the coronavirus in Utah.

UtahPolicy.com reported earlier this week that Herbert promised to help Wright in a race to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Mike Lee if he dropped out and endorsed Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox. Herbert confirmed he met with Wright to discuss dropping out of the race and supporting Cox but denied trying to make a deal with him. — Sonja Hutson Utah Congressional Delegates Comment On Death Of George Floyd Members of Utah’s Congressional delegation continue to weigh in on the death of George Floyd. Floyd died in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd had been handcuffed and was laying face down. Video of the incident has led to violent protests throughout the Midwest city and other parts of the country. Republican Rep. John Curtis tweeted Friday that he is “unable to comprehend” the death of Floyd saying we can’t let violence and racism erode what the country stands for. Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams called the killing senseless and outrageous, and he asked that people work toward healing the divide in the country.

""These boards must not include current police officers or relatives of police officers. The people on these boards must not be appointed by local Mayors, or Governors. We want the ability to vote for the members of these boards and have them give us the accountability and transparency which is needed to protect the people,"" the petition says. Lex Scott, the founder of Black Lives Matter Utah, is seeking 100,000 signatures in support of a police reform bill. She started the petition after George Floyd, a black Minnesota man, died Monday while in police custody, sparking dozens of protests across the United States. Scott said Black Lives Matter Utah will not hold a protest of its own. ""Although Black Lives Matter Utah stands in solidarity with Minneapolis and we hope for justice in this case, we will not be holding a protest. We use protest as a tool to achieve a clear goal. For example if we want body cam footage then we will do a protest,"" Scott said in a post on the Black Lives Matter Utah Facebook page. Floyd was arrested Monday after a grocery store employee called the police to report someone trying to pass a counterfeit bill. A 10-minute video of Floyd’s arrest soon circulated online. The video shot by a bystander shows a Minneapolis police officer pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck while the man gasps for air with his face against the pavement. Floyd then lost consciousness and was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Four officers involved in Floyd’s death have been fired by the Minneapolis Police Department, and many are calling for charges to be filed against them, including the city’s mayor.

This suit of blackness we wear is heavy and tedious, a constant reminder that we have to be wary of our very existence in everyday spaces and places no matter where we are. Whether it’s being threatened with calling the police while bird-watching in New York City’s Central Park, being accosted by armed men and killed while jogging in southern Georgia or losing your life in the Twin Cities of Minnesota in an altercation with police, we don’t feel safe. As a middle-aged black man raised on the south side of Chicago, I didn’t grow up to fear law enforcement, but in today’s climate that has changed dramatically. I dread any potential interaction with police, for fear that I might become the next tragic victim of an innocuous situation gone deadly wrong. It is a fear shared by my wife, Bridget Shears — who is also African American and a south side Chicago native. “We can’t even be in a place where we’re just standing around. We can get arrested for anything and it takes (authorities in Minneapolis) this long for them to (arrest the kneeling officer),” she said. “I think that’s appalling,” she told me as we discussed the violent week in our Wasatch Front home. Noting the rage of demonstrators in the Twin Cities that has led to days of civil unrest, my wife lamented that the protests seldom result in justice for the victims of police brutality. “We’re saying that we’re angry and we don’t get anywhere with our anger. We can talk about it, we can protest, but we have a president who calls us thugs versus people who are carrying firearms and being threatening to (lawmakers) in (Michigan) and that’s OK because those are just good people who just want their life,” she said. “But how about just letting us live?” She, too, lives in constant fear for the safety of friends and family who happen to be black. “I’m always afraid. That doesn’t go away. I mean, as a mother, as a sister, as a wife, I never get to put my guard down about being afraid,” she said. “Afraid of you all leaving the house and encountering the police. And so you start thinking about how at least we identify the police as an enemy, but there are (white) people out there that we don’t know, who are also our enemy.” She continued: “There’s always a fear, and it doesn’t seem like there’s ever a point at which it gets better. Sometimes just hearing from people and making sure that they are OK is a relief — that at least they’re hopefully in their home and safe. But as soon as they walk out the door, there’s always a fear that they won’t return and it could be nothing that they have done except being a black man that is threatening to their livelihood, to their life.” Yes, being black in America can feel like the sword of Damocles is constantly hanging overhead and going to drop. Recent incidents involving African American men and Caucasian antagonists have become stark reminders of that very reality. In New York, avid bird-lover Christian Cooper asked a white woman to put her dog on a leash. When she refused, he started filming, then the woman called 911 and said that “an African American man is threatening my life.” In Brunswick, Georgia, Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed on Feb. 23 during a confrontation involving three white men as he was jogging through the Satilla Shores neighborhood. And this week, George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police who were called to investigate the alleged use of counterfeit currency at a retail establishment. Having lived in Utah for almost 20 years, we often compare our lives today to the environment we grew up in the Midwest. Race has always been an issue, but we seem to be facing many of the same societal challenges decade after decade. And what’s more, in some ways the divide has widened. We want to believe that life for our 7-year-old grandson may be better and less socially threatening in the years ahead, but part of us worries the future could be fraught with many of the identical concerns currently at issue.",0.0

Floyd, a black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. On Friday, President Trump spoke with Floyd's family, saying he understood their pain. That call came several hours after his tweet about about rioters in Minneapolis sparked outrage, and drew a warning label from Twitter. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. The protesters have moved from the White House to another part of the city. Multiple reporters posted that they were inside the White House and that the Secret Service was not letting them leave the grounds during the lockdown. The Secret Service frequently locks down the White House for perceived security threats, such as packages or bags left nearby. But the building is rarely locked down for protests. And while protests are a daily occurrence outside the White House, they are often small – drawing a few dozen people, at most. While the largest protests have enveloped Minneapolis, prompting the deployment of 500 National Guardsmen, people have taken to the streets from New York to Chicago to the California coast. Seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville on Thursday night, dozens were arrested in New York City, officers fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters in Phoenix and a driver appeared to intentionally run over a protester in Denver. The Secret Service said that their ""personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration in Lafayette Park. In the interest of public safety we encourage all to remain peaceful.""

Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said.

Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance.""

Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday's death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Article continues below After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day's protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota's response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would ... have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany's Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd's killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

Minneapolis Gov. Tim Walz called on protesters to disperse early Saturday morning after a non-violent demonstration there turned to riots, looting and vandalization. “The absolute chaos — this is not grieving, and this is not making a statement [about an injustice] that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed — this is dangerous,” he said. “You need to go home.” Walz said he spoke with Floyd’s family, who said the violence that had overtaken the city was counterproductive to the message activists were trying to send about the 46-year-old’s death. Floyd died Monday after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck during an arrest for nearly 9 minutes. There have been daily protests since the incident — which was recorded on video — calling for the officer and three others present during the arrest to face charges. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and bail was set at $500,000. All four officers, including Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were fired from the MPD. Minneapolis Protesters took to the streets across the country Friday night, many beginning as peaceful demonstrations that later took a more violent turn. Several buildings were torched while businesses were vandalized and looted. Walz blamed groups unrelated to the Floyd cause, including anarchists, white supremacists and drug cartel participants, for inciting the riots. “The sheer number of rioters has made it impossible to make coherent arrests,” he said Saturday morning. “The capacity to be able to do offensive action was greatly diminished.” “There terrifying thing is that this resembles more a military operation now as you observe ringleaders moving from place to place.” Walz activated the National Guard earlier in the week, and 500 responded to Friday night’s protests. The Minnesota National Guard tweeted Saturday that it’s activating an additional 1,000 service members Saturday. “This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota National Guard’s 164-year history,” the agency said. Washington, D.C. Protests gripped the nation’s capital, as well, with some 2,000 activists gathering outside the White House. The Secret Service temporarily put the White House on lockdown Friday evening, not allowing anyone to leave or enter the building. Some people said President Donald Trump’s tweet calling protesters “thugs” only served to inflame tensions, WRC-TV reported. “We are human beings that want justice for our people,” participant Anzhane Laine told the news station. Washington, D.C., police officers arrested five people, including one woman who allegedly climbed over a barrier. Local officials said multiple Secret Service officers sustained injuries. Officers deployed pepper spray int he crowd as they pushed against metal barriers and tried to remove them. President Donald Trump condemned the protests outside the White House as having nothing to do with Floyd. He also praised the actions of the Secret Service. “Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,” Trump said in a series of tweets. New York City Police and thousands of demonstrators clashed outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, with protesters throwing water bottles and other objects at officers. The police shot tear gas to try to disperse the crowd, which chanted “black lives matter” and “we want justice.” Police made between 50 to 100 arrests, a senior police official told The New York Times. Crowds also gathered in the nearby Fort Greene neighborhood, setting a patrol van on fire and tossing fireworks. Atlanta Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called for calm Friday night after protesters there torched a visitors center at Centennial Olympic Park and vandalized the CNN Center. “This is not a protest,” she said. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose. When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn’t do this to our city. You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police said they clashed with protesters, who threw knives, eggs, firecrackers and other debris. Officers fired tear gas into the crowds. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday he plans to deploy the National Guard to quell the disorder. Kentucky Demonstrators in Louisville protested not only the death of Floyd, but also that of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician killed while in bed in her own apartment when police conducted a raid. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was also shot in the March 13 raid, said police didn’t identify themselves when they forced their way into the apartment. Thinking the plainclothes officers were robbers, Walker said he discharged his gun, injuring one of the officers. Police opened fire, killing Taylor. Protesters in Louisville and Lexington called for an end of police violence against unarmed black people. The march in Lexington was largely peaceful, shutting down roads as they progressed through the city. Police shot tear gas and pepper bullets in Louisville, though, to disperse crowds. Footage from the protest appeared to show a Louisville Metro Police Department officer directly targeting at a WAVE-TV reporter and cameraman with pepper bullets. Portland, Ore. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency in response to protests and imposed a curfew for the weekend. Protesters set fire to the Multnomah County Justice Center, which includes the county jail and a police precinct. People were working inside the building, but they were able to evacuate and the facility’s sprinkler system doused the flames. “Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters,” Wheeler said. “All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything. This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting.” Protests were also seen in several cities in Denver, Chicago, Des Moines, Iowa, New Orleans, Lincoln, Neb., Boston, Detroit, Kansas City, Mo., Las Vegas, Charlotte, N.C., Richmond, Va., and Seattle, and California, Indiana, Ohio and Texas.",0.0

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive Sunday at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, to join three crew members already there. After a stay of up to four months, they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn’t witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. “We are back in the game. It’s very satisfying,” said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, “USA! USA!” as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward.

Charlie Riedel, Associated Press President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch, proclaimed: “Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.” He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a “future of American dominance in space.” With the liftoff, SpaceX became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, issued a statement in which he called the launch “a dream come true.” At a post-liftoff rally held at NASA’s massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence commended Musk. Pence added that as the nation deals with the coronavirus and racial strife, “I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s” during Apollo. The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. His crewmate batted around a sparkly purplish toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: “This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form.” Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, large numbers of spectators gathered along beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. “With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” he said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the flight control center, the SpaceX controllers wore masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists.

The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high, and Musk said he would take responsibility if anything went wrong.

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let's light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive Sunday at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, to join three crew members already there. After a stay of up to four months, they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn't witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. “We are back in the game. It’s very satisfying,” said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, “USA! USA!"" as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch, proclaimed: “Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.” He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a “future of American dominance in space.” With the liftoff, SpaceX became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China.

1621109042,2020-05-30 15:27:00,2 astronauts climb aboard SpaceX rocket for historic flight,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2020/05/30/astronauts-climb-aboard/,en,True,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Cape Canaveral, Fla. • A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from home soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let's light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive Sunday at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, to join three crew members already there. After a stay of up to four months, they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn't witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. “We are back in the game. It’s very satisfying,” said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, “USA! USA!"" as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch, proclaimed: “Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.” He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a “future of American dominance in space.” With the liftoff, SpaceX became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, issued a statement in which he called the launch “a dream come true.” At a post-liftoff rally held at NASA's massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence commended Musk. Pence added that as the nation deals with the coronavirus and racial strife, ""I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s” during Apollo. The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. His crewmate batted around a sparkly purplish toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: ""This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form.” Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, large numbers of spectators gathered along beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. “With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” he said. ""We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the flight control center, the SpaceX controllers wore masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) Saturday's mission is technically considered a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high, and Musk said he would take responsibility if anything went wrong. Just before liftoff, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said she was “super nervous — stomach in throat.” Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report. ___",0.0

1621109571,2020-05-30 14:32:00,Minnesota To Deploy Record Guard Force To Contain Unrest Over Death Of George Floyd,https://www.upr.org/post/minnesota-deploy-record-guard-force-contain-unrest-over-death-george-floyd,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard. ""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

1621118781,2020-05-30 15:58:38,Thousands take to Salt Lake City streets in protest against racism after George Floyd killing,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/5/30/21275674/thousands-take-to-salt-lake-city-streets-protest-against-racism-george-floyd-killing,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"Salt Lake endures long day of protests as national anger over racism and the death of George Floyd grips the country Share All sharing options for: Salt Lake endures long day of protests as national anger over racism and the death of George Floyd grips the country SALT LAKE CITY — A drive-by protest of police brutality at Library Square Saturday morning simmered over the noon hour as a thousand marchers joined in before boiling over in the afternoon heat as demonstrators spray-painted vulgarities on the police station and burned a patrol car before marching up to the state Capitol. Not long after, a “10-33” call went out asking officers throughout the valley to help, and to help quickly. Hundreds of police officers — with sirens and lights flashing — could be seen racing to the downtown area. The governor activated the National Guard, one of 14 governors across the nation to do so Saturday, and the mayor ordered a curfew to start at 8 p.m. that will last through early Monday morning. And just before 9 p.m., police began their march to restore order in Salt Lake City, closing a nearly 11-hour day of protest, violence and restraint in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s curfew edict is in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place, including for the purpose of travel, with the following exceptions: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, News media People traveling to work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling to the airport; patronizing private businesses; seeking medical care; fleeing dangerous circumstances; or experiencing homelessness. Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in a public place for reasons other than these. “The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said as she invoked an 8 p.m. curfew that will extend until 6 a.m. Monday. Dozens were arrested, and several officers injured as well as some demonstrators. But the Beehive State did not see the level of violence experienced in other cities across the U.S. Clearing the city Police, who were joined by officers from multiple agencies across the Wasatch Front, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in two lines that stretched the length of the street and beyond, attempting to push back the crowd that had swelled throughout the day. As night approached, a military helicopter circled overhead, but officers largely stayed in formation downtown and at the state Capitol as protesters continued talking, yelling and chanting. Discarded posters blew across the Capitol lawn, while a lone couple collected discarded water bottles that were left or thrown by protesters. “We are pleading with you to clear the city,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. “We’re not going anywhere. We intend to be on the street. We will enforce the laws.” Police did not aggressively enforce curfew right at 8 p.m., and few protesters had left on their own. By about 8:40 p.m., officers began advancing demonstrators toward City Hall. Some taunted and hurled expletives at officers, while others retreated onto the lawn. By 9 p.m. at the Capitol, an order to disperse was played over a loudspeaker. The crowd began yelling obscenities and some were flipping off the deputies standing in front of them. Others began to leave the way they were told, but about a dozen people sat down on the plaza, showcasing their intent to stay. “It is time to go home,” Brown said. “This is not helping. ... Nothing good can come of this now. This is not helpful. This does not promote the dialogue and conversation we need to have.” Officers in riot gear were seen being treated for what appeared to be minor injuries, mostly heat exhaustion, Brown said. They’d been hit with projectiles and pushed and one was attacked by a protester with a baseball bat. “Had it not been for his helmet, he could have been seriously injured or killed,” the chief said. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced south from 400 South to around 700 South. Officers led many with hands zip-tied into jail transport buses. At least two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave the premises. An attempt to restore peace Mendenhall, who surveyed the area from an Air National Guard helicopter overhead, said no one would be allowed on public streets except law enforcement, news media, medical personnel, and anyone transporting food, traveling to somewhere, patronizing businesses, fleeing danger or experiencing homelessness. “What is happening here does nothing to right past wrongs or rebuild a system that is unjust,” she said. “If you are on Salt Lake City streets right now ... go home. “Stop destroying our city.” Gov. Gary Herbert added, “Make no mistake, we’ll do whatever is necessary to restore order to our capital city, to Salt Lake.” Recently retired Pastor France A. Davis, of the Calvary Baptist Church on State Street, said, “We are all part of this community. There’s no use anybody destroying any of it.” He pleaded with people to protest more effectively. “It’s OK to be frustrated,” Rev. Davis said. “Do all you can, but do it nonviolently.” At one point, a man showed up with a bow and arrow and allegedly aimed it at protesters just before he was attacked by a group of people. That man, who is known to police, was taken away injured and bloodied from the scene as protesters then flipped and looted his car and set it on fire. Explosions could be heard from blocks away and dark smoke billowed into the air. The man later returned and got into a verbal argument with protesters. “I came down here originally to help the cops,” the man said. “But, all I did was yell out, ‘All lives matter’ and I got beat up by black people.” It was a scene similar to the final night of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City when officers in riot gear used similar tactics — with shields and rubber bullets — to push a large crowd that refused to disperse out of the city. Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera and many of her officers and deputies were on scene to assist and they brought a bus and other vehicles to transport arrested protesters to the Salt Lake County Jail. “We just need peace. Too many people are getting hurt. I’m willing to come to the table with whoever wants to come and talk to me about the issues. Especially with what’s going on nationwide,” she said. “I get it. I’m a person of color as well and I get it. I’m happy to listen. I’m happy to make changes. But this is not how we do that,” Rivera said. She said the Unified Police Department has been doing all it can to make sure its officers are as diverse as our communities. “And it helps. But we need to communicate and listen, not just communicate. We have to learn to listen and be willing to make those changes and I’m happy to do so,” she said. Unsafe conditions Father Paul Truebenbach, of St. Peter and Paul Orthodox Christian Church in Salt Lake City, was at the protest to protect the church near the 7-Eleven that was looted at 400 South and 300 East. He said he asked officers if he should hold church services Sunday, to mixed reaction from police. “This idea of social justice is so dangerous because it seeks to change everything around you. In orthodox, it is the opposite, it seeks to change us. You can’t change what you don’t have,” Father Truebenbach said. He said about a half-dozen people will be guarding the church through the night and no decision had been made about services. Jacenta Morris, 36, a black woman from Salt Lake City, said she came to protest with her family, to be a part of history she hopes will result in change. But the violence that ensued disturbed her. “I think this is too much. I think they should calm down and do it a different way than rioting,” she said. “I worry about my sons, I have two boys,” Morris said. “Anything could happen to them, they could be walking down the street and anything could happen.” Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, pleaded with people to stop the violence. “We understand the frustration and anger of those protesting,” she said, adding that the protest started out OK, but “the conversation changed.” “Nobody will remember why we were here,” Hollins said. The original message opposing systematic racism, she said, will be overshadowed by violence. “The solution is not burning down a city.” Grid View A police vehicle drives near a burning car as people protest police brutality in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

In addition to an unoccupied Salt Lake patrol car being overturned and burned, another unmarked police vehicle had its windows smashed out. Other vehicles parked nearby were vandalized as well, including a news media vehicle, which bore the painted words: “Stop protecting them.” After a couple of hours of letting protesters get their frustrations out, police in riot gear and armored vehicles started to form a perimeter around the library and systematically move people out of the area. TRAX service in the downtown area was halted about 5 p.m. and travelers were encouraged to avoid the area. Protesters knelt in front of a line of officers wearing riot gear outside the Salt Lake Main Library just after 5 p.m. Behind them was a burnt out and vandalized police car that hours earlier, protesters had pushed on its top, beat out the windows and started on fire. An @slcpd car just got overturned at the #GeorgeFloyd protest in Salt Lake City. pic.twitter.com/iFpEmpkyEq — Jacob Klopfenstein (@JFKlopfenstein) May 30, 2020 Another large group of protesters shouting and holding signs convened at the Utah Capitol, where a line of troopers from the Utah Highway Patrol stood, not letting them get close to the building. Looting was reported at a 7-Eleven near the library, although there was also a video of protesters intervening and pleading with others not to steal or destroy property. Jay Barton said he was inspired by a former military man who yelled at the protesters, telling them their actions were hurting their cause. Barton said the unidentified man was telling him he felt inspired to come downtown Saturday when suddenly a group of protesters ran toward the convenience store, broke windows and started stealing beer and other items. “This man immediately walked up front and started yelling at the people who shattered the glass. His words where inspiring. Truly a beautiful moment.” “This isn’t the answer. This is what they want. They want us against each other,” the man yelled. “You need to be against every single person who’s turned this into a criminal activity. … This isn’t right.” Police were also seen responding to reports of vandalism at City Creek Center mall. It was not immediately clear whether anything was stolen. Large rocks and fireworks were thrown at police in riot gear as protesters chanted phrases such as “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can’t breathe.” A woman also attempted to attack several protesters with a hammer, hitting another woman who declined medical assistance, Salt Lake Police Sgt. Keith Horrocks said. Protesters wrestled the hammer from the woman, Horrocks said, and she ran off before police could find her. Fighting for change Katie Allen Yazzie, a 17-year-old Navajo girl, attended the rally with a sign that said, “My skin is not a weapon.” “Me being a person of color does not mean that the police should be scared of me or of anyone who has the color of my skin or darker. It’s to the point that I’m scared of police in general. I don’t want them around me because they’re not good to me,” she said. Her mother, Christine Allen, attended on Saturday with her. She said officers have helped her in the past and she respects them, but believes all people aren’t treated equally. “I think that a society is only as good as the people who are the most vulnerable are treated,” she said. “We have to stand up for each other because people of color don’t’ have a police force they can rely on. They have to rely on the community. They have to rely on each other.” Ishjon Hawkins, 30, of New Orleans, said he joined the protest because of the way he feels police have treated him in the past. “Me being a black man, growing up, I had a lot of run-ins with the police and they’re aggressive. They abuse their authority,” he said. “We want change. We need different laws.” Asked if he has issues with police in general or just some officers, Hawkins said, “Honestly, it’s white police. It’s just like they’ve got it out for us. … I don’t get it.” Marvin Oliveros was at the protest and encouraged people to continue protesting. Belgard’s step-brother, Cody Paris Belgard, 30, was shot and killed by five Salt Lake police officers in December 2018. The shooting was later determined to be justified by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Oliveros said he understands better than anyone what Floyd’s family is going through. “I know the pain they’re going through. I know the answers they’re searching for,” he said, encouraging protesters to “keep up the pressure” so all victims of police brutality are remembered. “While we were devastated to hear what happened to George Floyd — and make no mistake: we condemn what happened on all counts — we were saddened today to see the violence and riots here in Salt Lake City,” Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Lexi Cunningham said. She said police were using East High School as a staging area to respond to the protests, which erupted in pockets all over the city after dark. “We urge all community members to continue the fight to end systemic racism, to look for peaceful ways to improve communities daily, and here in Salt Lake City, we urge you to please be safe and follow the curfew established by Mayor Mendenhall,” Cunningham said.

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News Standing their ground The exterior of the state Capitol was vandalized, as was the stone retaining wall near the street. At one point, two people with cans of spray paint wrote obscenities on the walkway and granite pillars, but just as a trooper moved to shoo them away, another waved him back to the line of officers on the last set of steps leading into the Capitol’s front doors. The officers, most of whom stood stone-faced as protesters yelled questions or obscenities at them, were from several agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Office and the Utah Highway Patrol. Some officers engaged in conversations with protesters, including discussions of race, history and philosophy. Among those talking with officers was Rae Duckworth, who lost her cousin Bobby Duckworth in September 2019 to an officer-involved shooting in Wellington, Carbon County. She said she was there with Black Lives Matter and Utahns Against Police Brutality. “We’re just here peacefully protesting ... and I just really want to have conversations,” the 28-year-old Salt Lake County woman said. “I really think transparency and communication are two big issues. We don’t know what law enforcement does. We know they police themselves, and that doesn’t do anything good or valuable for the community.” She said several officers engaged in conversations, and she felt most of them were productive. She pointed out that at least one said he’d meet with local Black Lives Matter leaders to discuss what kinds of change would restore trust and confidence in policing for those who feel unfairly targeted. “They even have their opinions about George Floyd, that they’re brave enough to speak up about,” she said. “And they’ve also told me that they actually speak up against racism in their own departments, which is a step that needs to be taken.” One officer said he was married to a person of color, and he told her he thought it would be helpful to him as he raises four mixed-race children. “I think one of them actually felt this movement,” Duckworth said. “Versus the other ones who stand there like brick walls or statues.” Some people were passing by and decided to join the line of officers standing on the bottom stair of the Capitol steps, including one man who said, “I’m here to protect the people’s house.” One black man engaged in an hourlong conversation about institutional racism with a number of those standing with police, including a firefighter and a Native American teenager. The small conversation expanded as a Hispanic man passing by added his thoughts, and the group jumped from slavery to genocide to the lack of educational opportunities and whether the protests accomplished anything important. As he rode away on a scooter about 7 p.m., a police officer yelled to him, “Awesome.” Clouds moved in and some rain fell, but the crowd thinned and then swelled throughout the afternoon and evening. At one point, protesters threw water bottles, rocks and other items at police. Earlier in the afternoon, while the protest was calm, people spoke about why they were there. “As a country, I just feel broken, and I feel scared for everyone in the black community. I just feel that our country is just not letting us live our lives, and innocent people are being killed for no reason,” Savanah Norman said, becoming emotional in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building.

Seeing a lot of people come out is very liberating and exciting to see, because I think, here in Utah, there is still a lot of racism. And so I’m really happy that people came out to show support,” Norman said. “I just think we’re at our last straw,” she said. “This is it. People are fed up, and they have every right to be. And I think this murder of George Floyd, everyone is just done. We’re done.” A show of solidarity Early on, the protest remained relatively uneventful, with even some children out with their parents to call for justice for Floyd. The protest had originally been planned as a vehicle caravan, with participants discouraged from rallying outside of their cars. Organizers asked for the protesters to maintain physical distance from others. Thousands of people in vehicles circled the Salt Lake City Police Department, many waving signs from their windows that said slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd,” with others decrying racism and calling for police reform. “I feel like I know what my ancestors went through in the 1960s, and it’s sad that here in 2020, we’re still saying, ‘I can’t believe this. We’re saying, ‘black lives matter.’ This isn’t the first time a black man has been killed like this,” Zala Long told the Deseret News. “It’s good because I feel like we’re showing the world, and we’re showing the SLCPD that we see them and we’re watching them, and we’re letting our voices be heard. I feel a lot of empathy, I feel a lot of sadness, but also I’m glad that we’re saying their names. We’re saying George Floyd, we’re saying ... Ahmed Arbery. We’re not going to forget about them. We care about them, because if we don’t, then no one else will,” she promised. She said she feels the Floyd case is getting more attention than others. “But I feel like we’ve been at the tipping point for years. we’re tired of fighting for our rights, but we’re going to fight for our rights,” she said, explaining that she believes the police force needs to be restructured to root out systemic racism. “The question isn’t who’s next, it’s when is he next. When am I next, when is she next, when are my brothers next, when is my mom next, when is my dad next?” Naia James added. Within an hour, cars packed the streets, creating a standstill in traffic downtown, and thousands also marched on foot chanting “We can’t breathe,” making their way up to the state Capitol. Beth Jennings and her family lived in Minneapolis before moving to Utah, and says she has friends there who are being impacted by the turmoil. “We just wanted to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis right now against police violence,” Jennings said. Haizel Jennings, 10, said of Floyd’s death: “I feel like it’s sort of unhumanizing of that cop because I feel like it’s sort of human right to try, if at some point you could stop someone dying, to stop it. It’s part of human rights, I think.” “I would hope all of us will stand tall for the issues of civil rights,” Herbert said. “What we see today is not typical Utah behavior. We’re better than that here in Utah.” Contributing: Annie Knox, Alex Cabrero",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

1621151127,2020-05-30 17:36:38,"Cities brace for increasing unrest, call in National Guard",https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/5/30/21275763/national-guard-police-protests-george-floyd,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"MINNEAPOLIS — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would ... have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” ___ Murphy reported from Oklahoma City.",0.0

During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place, including for the purpose of travel, with the following exceptions: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, News media People traveling to work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling to the airport; patronizing private businesses; seeking medical care; fleeing dangerous circumstances; or experiencing homelessness. Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in a public place for reasons other than these. “The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said as she invoked an 8 p.m. curfew that will extend until 6 a.m. Monday. Dozens were arrested, and several officers injured as well as some demonstrators. But the Beehive State did not see the level of violence experienced in other cities across the U.S. Clearing the city Police, who were joined by officers from multiple agencies across the Wasatch Front, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in two lines that stretched the length of the street and beyond, attempting to push back the crowd that had swelled throughout the day. As night approached, a military helicopter circled overhead, but officers largely stayed in formation downtown and at the state Capitol as protesters continued talking, yelling and chanting. Discarded posters blew across the Capitol lawn, while a lone couple collected discarded water bottles that were left or thrown by protesters. “We are pleading with you to clear the city,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. “We’re not going anywhere. We intend to be on the street. We will enforce the laws.” Police did not aggressively enforce curfew right at 8 p.m., and few protesters had left on their own. By about 8:40 p.m., officers began advancing demonstrators toward City Hall. Some taunted and hurled expletives at officers, while others retreated onto the lawn. By 9 p.m. at the Capitol, an order to disperse was played over a loudspeaker. The crowd began yelling obscenities and some were flipping off the deputies standing in front of them. Others began to leave the way they were told, but about a dozen people sat down on the plaza, showcasing their intent to stay. “It is time to go home,” Brown said. “This is not helping. ... Nothing good can come of this now. This is not helpful. This does not promote the dialogue and conversation we need to have.” Officers in riot gear were seen being treated for what appeared to be minor injuries, mostly heat exhaustion, Brown said. They’d been hit with projectiles and pushed and one was attacked by a protester with a baseball bat. “Had it not been for his helmet, he could have been seriously injured or killed,” the chief said. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced south from 400 South to around 700 South. Officers led many with hands zip-tied into jail transport buses. At least two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave the premises. An attempt to restore peace Mendenhall, who surveyed the area from an Air National Guard helicopter overhead, said no one would be allowed on public streets except law enforcement, news media, medical personnel, and anyone transporting food, traveling to somewhere, patronizing businesses, fleeing danger or experiencing homelessness. “What is happening here does nothing to right past wrongs or rebuild a system that is unjust,” she said. “If you are on Salt Lake City streets right now ... go home. “Stop destroying our city.” Gov. Gary Herbert added, “Make no mistake, we’ll do whatever is necessary to restore order to our capital city, to Salt Lake.” Recently retired Pastor France A. Davis, of the Calvary Baptist Church on State Street, said, “We are all part of this community. There’s no use anybody destroying any of it.” He pleaded with people to protest more effectively. “It’s OK to be frustrated,” Rev. Davis said. “Do all you can, but do it nonviolently.” At one point, a man showed up with a bow and arrow and allegedly aimed it at protesters just before he was attacked by a group of people. That man, who is known to police, was taken away injured and bloodied from the scene as protesters then flipped and looted his car and set it on fire. Explosions could be heard from blocks away and dark smoke billowed into the air. The man later returned and got into a verbal argument with protesters. “I came down here originally to help the cops,” the man said. “But, all I did was yell out, ‘All lives matter’ and I got beat up by black people.” It was a scene similar to the final night of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City when officers in riot gear used similar tactics — with shields and rubber bullets — to push a large crowd that refused to disperse out of the city. Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera and many of her officers and deputies were on scene to assist and they brought a bus and other vehicles to transport arrested protesters to the Salt Lake County Jail. “We just need peace. Too many people are getting hurt. I’m willing to come to the table with whoever wants to come and talk to me about the issues. Especially with what’s going on nationwide,” she said. “I get it. I’m a person of color as well and I get it. I’m happy to listen. I’m happy to make changes. But this is not how we do that,” Rivera said. She said the Unified Police Department has been doing all it can to make sure its officers are as diverse as our communities. “And it helps. But we need to communicate and listen, not just communicate. We have to learn to listen and be willing to make those changes and I’m happy to do so,” she said. Unsafe conditions Father Paul Truebenbach, of St. Peter and Paul Orthodox Christian Church in Salt Lake City, was at the protest to protect the church near the 7-Eleven that was looted at 400 South and 300 East. He said he asked officers if he should hold church services Sunday, to mixed reaction from police. “This idea of social justice is so dangerous because it seeks to change everything around you. In orthodox, it is the opposite, it seeks to change us. You can’t change what you don’t have,” Father Truebenbach said. He said about a half-dozen people will be guarding the church through the night and no decision had been made about services. Jacenta Morris, 36, a black woman from Salt Lake City, said she came to protest with her family, to be a part of history she hopes will result in change. But the violence that ensued disturbed her. “I think this is too much. I think they should calm down and do it a different way than rioting,” she said. “I worry about my sons, I have two boys,” Morris said. “Anything could happen to them, they could be walking down the street and anything could happen.” Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, pleaded with people to stop the violence. “We understand the frustration and anger of those protesting,” she said, adding that the protest started out OK, but “the conversation changed.” “Nobody will remember why we were here,” Hollins said. The original message opposing systematic racism, she said, will be overshadowed by violence. “The solution is not burning down a city.” Grid View A police vehicle drives near a burning car as people protest police brutality in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

Allred, Deseret News Disordered destruction At least two police vehicles were destroyed or suffered heavy damage. In addition to an unoccupied Salt Lake patrol car being overturned and burned, another unmarked police vehicle had its windows smashed out. Other vehicles parked nearby were vandalized as well, including a news media vehicle, which bore the painted words: “Stop protecting them.” After a couple of hours of letting protesters get their frustrations out, police in riot gear and armored vehicles started to form a perimeter around the library and systematically move people out of the area. TRAX service in the downtown area was halted about 5 p.m. and travelers were encouraged to avoid the area. Protesters knelt in front of a line of officers wearing riot gear outside the Salt Lake Main Library just after 5 p.m. Behind them was a burnt out and vandalized police car that hours earlier, protesters had pushed on its top, beat out the windows and started on fire. An @slcpd car just got overturned at the #GeorgeFloyd protest in Salt Lake City. pic.twitter.com/iFpEmpkyEq — Jacob Klopfenstein (@JFKlopfenstein) May 30, 2020 Another large group of protesters shouting and holding signs convened at the Utah Capitol, where a line of troopers from the Utah Highway Patrol stood, not letting them get close to the building. Looting was reported at a 7-Eleven near the library, although there was also a video of protesters intervening and pleading with others not to steal or destroy property. Jay Barton said he was inspired by a former military man who yelled at the protesters, telling them their actions were hurting their cause. Barton said the unidentified man was telling him he felt inspired to come downtown Saturday when suddenly a group of protesters ran toward the convenience store, broke windows and started stealing beer and other items. “This man immediately walked up front and started yelling at the people who shattered the glass. His words where inspiring. Truly a beautiful moment.” “This isn’t the answer. This is what they want. They want us against each other,” the man yelled. “You need to be against every single person who’s turned this into a criminal activity. … This isn’t right.” Police were also seen responding to reports of vandalism at City Creek Center mall. It was not immediately clear whether anything was stolen. Large rocks and fireworks were thrown at police in riot gear as protesters chanted phrases such as “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can’t breathe.” A woman also attempted to attack several protesters with a hammer, hitting another woman who declined medical assistance, Salt Lake Police Sgt. Keith Horrocks said. Protesters wrestled the hammer from the woman, Horrocks said, and she ran off before police could find her. Fighting for change Katie Allen Yazzie, a 17-year-old Navajo girl, attended the rally with a sign that said, “My skin is not a weapon.” “Me being a person of color does not mean that the police should be scared of me or of anyone who has the color of my skin or darker. It’s to the point that I’m scared of police in general. I don’t want them around me because they’re not good to me,” she said. Her mother, Christine Allen, attended on Saturday with her. She said officers have helped her in the past and she respects them, but believes all people aren’t treated equally. “I think that a society is only as good as the people who are the most vulnerable are treated,” she said. “We have to stand up for each other because people of color don’t’ have a police force they can rely on. They have to rely on the community. They have to rely on each other.” Ishjon Hawkins, 30, of New Orleans, said he joined the protest because of the way he feels police have treated him in the past. “Me being a black man, growing up, I had a lot of run-ins with the police and they’re aggressive. They abuse their authority,” he said. “We want change. We need different laws.” Asked if he has issues with police in general or just some officers, Hawkins said, “Honestly, it’s white police. It’s just like they’ve got it out for us. … I don’t get it.” Marvin Oliveros was at the protest and encouraged people to continue protesting. Belgard’s step-brother, Cody Paris Belgard, 30, was shot and killed by five Salt Lake police officers in December 2018. The shooting was later determined to be justified by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Oliveros said he understands better than anyone what Floyd’s family is going through. “I know the pain they’re going through. I know the answers they’re searching for,” he said, encouraging protesters to “keep up the pressure” so all victims of police brutality are remembered. “While we were devastated to hear what happened to George Floyd — and make no mistake: we condemn what happened on all counts — we were saddened today to see the violence and riots here in Salt Lake City,” Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Lexi Cunningham said. She said police were using East High School as a staging area to respond to the protests, which erupted in pockets all over the city after dark. “We urge all community members to continue the fight to end systemic racism, to look for peaceful ways to improve communities daily, and here in Salt Lake City, we urge you to please be safe and follow the curfew established by Mayor Mendenhall,” Cunningham said.

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News Standing their ground The exterior of the state Capitol was vandalized, as was the stone retaining wall near the street. At one point, two people with cans of spray paint wrote obscenities on the walkway and granite pillars, but just as a trooper moved to shoo them away, another waved him back to the line of officers on the last set of steps leading into the Capitol’s front doors. The officers, most of whom stood stone-faced as protesters yelled questions or obscenities at them, were from several agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Office and the Utah Highway Patrol. Some officers engaged in conversations with protesters, including discussions of race, history and philosophy. Among those talking with officers was Rae Duckworth, who lost her cousin Bobby Duckworth in September 2019 to an officer-involved shooting in Wellington, Carbon County. She said she was there with Black Lives Matter and Utahns Against Police Brutality. “We’re just here peacefully protesting ... and I just really want to have conversations,” the 28-year-old Salt Lake County woman said. “I really think transparency and communication are two big issues. We don’t know what law enforcement does. We know they police themselves, and that doesn’t do anything good or valuable for the community.” She said several officers engaged in conversations, and she felt most of them were productive. She pointed out that at least one said he’d meet with local Black Lives Matter leaders to discuss what kinds of change would restore trust and confidence in policing for those who feel unfairly targeted. “They even have their opinions about George Floyd, that they’re brave enough to speak up about,” she said. “And they’ve also told me that they actually speak up against racism in their own departments, which is a step that needs to be taken.” One officer said he was married to a person of color, and he told her he thought it would be helpful to him as he raises four mixed-race children. “I think one of them actually felt this movement,” Duckworth said. “Versus the other ones who stand there like brick walls or statues.” Some people were passing by and decided to join the line of officers standing on the bottom stair of the Capitol steps, including one man who said, “I’m here to protect the people’s house.” One black man engaged in an hourlong conversation about institutional racism with a number of those standing with police, including a firefighter and a Native American teenager. The small conversation expanded as a Hispanic man passing by added his thoughts, and the group jumped from slavery to genocide to the lack of educational opportunities and whether the protests accomplished anything important. As he rode away on a scooter about 7 p.m., a police officer yelled to him, “Awesome.” Clouds moved in and some rain fell, but the crowd thinned and then swelled throughout the afternoon and evening. At one point, protesters threw water bottles, rocks and other items at police. Earlier in the afternoon, while the protest was calm, people spoke about why they were there. “As a country, I just feel broken, and I feel scared for everyone in the black community. I just feel that our country is just not letting us live our lives, and innocent people are being killed for no reason,” Savanah Norman said, becoming emotional in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building.

Laura Seitz, Deseret News Related Deseret News reporter and his wife explore the perils of being black in America “I do feel a lot of support today here. Seeing a lot of people come out is very liberating and exciting to see, because I think, here in Utah, there is still a lot of racism. And so I’m really happy that people came out to show support,” Norman said. “I just think we’re at our last straw,” she said. “This is it. People are fed up, and they have every right to be. And I think this murder of George Floyd, everyone is just done. We’re done.” A show of solidarity Early on, the protest remained relatively uneventful, with even some children out with their parents to call for justice for Floyd. The protest had originally been planned as a vehicle caravan, with participants discouraged from rallying outside of their cars. Organizers asked for the protesters to maintain physical distance from others. Thousands of people in vehicles circled the Salt Lake City Police Department, many waving signs from their windows that said slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd,” with others decrying racism and calling for police reform. “I feel like I know what my ancestors went through in the 1960s, and it’s sad that here in 2020, we’re still saying, ‘I can’t believe this. We’re saying, ‘black lives matter.’ This isn’t the first time a black man has been killed like this,” Zala Long told the Deseret News. “It’s good because I feel like we’re showing the world, and we’re showing the SLCPD that we see them and we’re watching them, and we’re letting our voices be heard. I feel a lot of empathy, I feel a lot of sadness, but also I’m glad that we’re saying their names. We’re saying George Floyd, we’re saying ... Ahmed Arbery. We’re not going to forget about them. We care about them, because if we don’t, then no one else will,” she promised. She said she feels the Floyd case is getting more attention than others. “But I feel like we’ve been at the tipping point for years. we’re tired of fighting for our rights, but we’re going to fight for our rights,” she said, explaining that she believes the police force needs to be restructured to root out systemic racism. “The question isn’t who’s next, it’s when is he next. When am I next, when is she next, when are my brothers next, when is my mom next, when is my dad next?” Naia James added. Within an hour, cars packed the streets, creating a standstill in traffic downtown, and thousands also marched on foot chanting “We can’t breathe,” making their way up to the state Capitol. Beth Jennings and her family lived in Minneapolis before moving to Utah, and says she has friends there who are being impacted by the turmoil. “We just wanted to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis right now against police violence,” Jennings said. Haizel Jennings, 10, said of Floyd’s death: “I feel like it’s sort of unhumanizing of that cop because I feel like it’s sort of human right to try, if at some point you could stop someone dying, to stop it. It’s part of human rights, I think.” “I would hope all of us will stand tall for the issues of civil rights,” Herbert said. “What we see today is not typical Utah behavior. We’re better than that here in Utah.” Contributing: Annie Knox, Alex Cabrero",0.0

SALT LAKE CITY, May 30, 2020 (Gephardt Daily) — What was planned as a peaceful protest in Salt Lake City grew from a few hundred attendees chanting for social justice to a crowd of thousands, a few of whom got violent, destroying a police car and spraying angry messages on nearby buildings and the Utah Capitol. The protest was designed to bring attention to the in-custody death of George Floyd, a black man from Minneapolis who pleaded for his life as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Floyd died as nearby spectators pleaded with officers to allow him some air. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The first few hours of the Salt Lake City protest were peaceful and focused. Then, a few people in attendance decided to spray paint messages on a police car, then flip it. Others beat out the windows and attacked it with objects ranging from a skateboard to a crowbar. A few people jumped on top of the overturned car while others posed for smiling selfies with the vandalized vehicle behind them. Soon, someone slipped something through the broken windows and yelled for others to stand clear of the expected explosion. The fire grew slowly, but eventually everyone backed away due to the high flames and intense heat consuming the patrol car. A fire truck arrived and stood by, but allowed the totalled car to burn. Police also held back, making sure no one got hurt. Protesters eventually peeled off the main crowd, some walking toward the Capitol and others headed in other directions. As protesters arrived on the Capitol grounds, some sprayed messages on cement fixtures and others approached the staircase. More than two dozen Utah Highway Patrol officers stepped onto the stairs, making a human barrier between protesters and the Capitol. The officers were not in riot gear, and their guns remained holstered. The crowd began to chant some of Floyd’s last words: “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.” Elsewhere in the city, live news camera caught people looting a downtown 7-Eleven. Shortly after 5 p.m., Utah Gov. Gary Herbert tweeted that he was sending more law officials to the scene. “We condemn violence and looting,” Herbert’s tweet says. “I have activated the National Guard to help control the escalating situation in downtown Salt Lake City. “I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Up at the Capitol, more officers arrived, most some with riot gear. As the standoff continued, some crowd members threw water bottles at officers, and as some began to leave the scene, others arrived. At about 5:45 p.m., Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall called for an 8 p.m. curfew in the city. Gephardt Daily has a crew at the scene and will provide updated information as the story develops.",0.0

USA TODAY A crowd of St. George residents made their way to St. George City Hall Saturday morning to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter groups protesting the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man killed by police in Minneapolis on May 25. Protests have broken out across America after Floyd's death and the St. George group, several-dozen strong and armed with signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and 'No Justice, No Peace', said they wanted to join in voicing displeasure with police brutality. ""This is to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter chapters around the country as we call for justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Bernard Palacio (SLC) - and all the other POC that were unjustly killed at the hands of police,"" read the Facebook description for the event. George Floyd death: 8 minutes, 46 seconds and 'inherently dangerous': What's in the criminal complaint in the case From the parking lot of city hall, the organizers of the protest — Sydni Makemo and Troy Anderson — spoke about police brutality and how interested parties could get involved. ""My message to people is to get involved and learn about systemic racism, what it is and how it works in this country,"" Anderson said. ""Get involved in your communities, get involved in with these different groups here in Utah because Utah has got it going on. There are people who have been shot in this state and been killed while unarmed."" Anderson, a black man and head of the newly-formed Black Lives Matter group in St. George, spoke about his own encounters with the police and then made a plea with police in the area to curtail arrests and unwarranted traffic stops.

(Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News) ""I want to send a message to St. George, Washington, Ivins, Bloomington and all these cops that we're here and we're sick and tired of you harassing us,"" Anderson said. ""We're sick and tired of you pulling us over just to pull us over."" St. George Mayor Jon Pike made an appearance at the protest and acknowledged that he supported the protesters' right to express their opinion and share their concerns about law enforcement. ""It's important for us all to realize these things can happen anywhere and we hope they never happen here but we have to be mindful and vigilant as a government, as a police department and as a community,"" Pike said. ""We have to be the kind of community that's welcoming and mindful of all people so black lives matter and all lives matter, I agree with both. I'm glad we had people here today to express themselves and bring some awareness to the issue."" George Floyd death: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it As for what will be done to make sure the relationship between the police and people of color — especially black people — in the area is solid, Pike says that listening will be key. ""I feel like we do a pretty good job at this point in particular,"" Pike said. ""Our police department is well-trained, I think they're great examples of how to do law enforcement right. But I do always think we can be learning and developing and making sure that we're using best practices and listening."" Getting involved and invested Organizers said the larger goal of the protest was to create avenues for people to force change and become active in combating racism and social injustices both in Southern Utah and across the country.

(Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News) ""You need to be willing to know who is running for office and you need to vote people in place that are going to fight for positive police reform,"" Makemo said. ""You need to vote for people that say there needs to be criminal justice reform all around. You need to understand that people of color and marginalized communities are being massively affected on a daily basis and do what you can to stop it with your vote."" Though Anderson says he is just getting the Black Lives Matter group in St. George off the ground, he has plans for ways that St. George and Southern Utah residents can get in touch with people of color in the area to learn from their words and experiences. ""One of the things we're going to do is a meet and greet so the more people I can get that are of color to come to events and share their experiences, that's what I want to do,"" Anderson said. ""That's what's going to make a difference is people of color saying 'hey, I have a problem here' and that's what we need to do."" Pike says he is willing to meet Anderson halfway and that they will have conversations moving forward about how to connect those unaffected with people of color who can teach them about how to make St. George a better place for all. ""We'll be meeting with Troy and that's the main thing is just communication and making sure that if there's a place where we can do better that we listen to that and get the input,"" Pike said. ""If there's additional needs that our community has or additional training that we as city officials and city employees need to have then I'm all about that and I know the city would be as well.""

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall enacted the curfew — which lasts until 6 a.m. Monday — and Gov. Gary Herbert activated the Utah National Guard after thousands converged on the downtown area Saturday afternoon. Most people peacefully marched, chanted or blew their horns from vehicles. But some protesters turned to violence and vandalism, setting two cars on fire and attacking police officers, who responded with tear gas. ""The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. Authorities broadcast over a loudspeaker that the 8 p.m. curfew had taken effect, Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. Police were prepared to give people time to voluntarily leave, but they planned to arrest people who refused to comply, Brown said. “It is time to go home,” he said in a news conference after the curfew took effect. Police officers from across Utah and up to 200 Guard troops were deployed to rein in what Gov. Gary Herbert called an “escalating situation.” “We condemn violence and looting,” Herbert wrote, adding, “I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Many protesters departed about an hour after the curfew, when the order to leave was played over a loudspeaker. But some sat defiantly in a plaza outside the state Capitol. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced to enforce the curfew, and two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave, the Deseret News reported. One police officer was injured after a protester struck the officer on the back of the head with a baseball bat, and two other officers have been hospitalized because of heat exhaustion, he said. The police chief said he didn't have any reports of protester injuries. What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd."" People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Graffiti was also written on the state Capitol. Later in the afternoon, protesters flipped over a police vehicle and set it on fire. Men carrying rifles stood on top of the wreckage. Elsewhere, a man aimed a bow and arrow at a group of protesters before he was tackled. People then flipped over the man's car and set it on fire, the Deseret News reported. During the day, protesters marched through downtown Salt Lake City to the state Capitol chanting, “We can’t breathe,"" which Floyd said while he was in police custody. Floyd died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, leading to protests in cities across the U.S. A separate rally in Ogden drew about 1,000 people, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. “(We want to do) anything we can do as a people to stop the systematic bias and racism against people of color in our nation that’s gone on for 400 years,” Ogden resident Keyvin VanDyke said.",0.0
1621192002,2020-05-30 19:14:36,"Inspired By Death Of George Floyd, Protesters Flood Salt Lake City Streets",https://www.kuer.org/post/inspired-death-george-floyd-protesters-flood-salt-lake-city-streets,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Chants of “Justice for George Floyd” and “No justice, No peace” filled the hot Salt Lake City air Saturday morning, as more than a thousand protesters — some on foot, others in cars — marched against police brutality. Temperatures hovered in the lower 90s but that did little to prevent people from joining the movement. Originally billed as a car caravan around the Salt Lake City Police Department building, the event turned into something much larger. People marched from Denver Street to police headquarters before arriving at the Utah State Capitol. Protests started off peaceful from the morning into early afternoon. Later in the day, Salt Lake City police retweeted photos of an overturned squad car that had been set on fire and asked people to stay away from downtown due to “civil unrest.” Organizing The Protest Carly Haldeman, with the group Utah Against Police Brutality, helped organize the event. She said the recent police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville inspired the protest. But Salt Lake City has its issues too. “We have a local killer-cop problem,” Haldeman said. “They just shot Bernardo Palacios last Saturday. We think this was a murder and we demand all justice for police crime victims in Utah.” The manner of death in the three instances was different, but what was consistent among the cases was people of color were killed by police. On May 25, A Minneapolis police officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes as he was handcuffed and lying face down. In early March, Police in Louisville forcibly entered Taylor’s apartment to serve a search warrant and shot her eight times. And Palacio died from police gunfire in Salt Lake City last weekend after officers responded to a call of a man making a threat with a gun. Marchers Weigh In On Recent Events As the march kicked off, Alicia Moreira’s passion was evident. She took the initial role of leading hundreds of protesters in chants. “Black lives matter! End police brutality! No justice, No peace!” she yelled, almost losing her voice, as they moved down Salt Lake City streets. “We’re just saying that my life matters, my skin matters, my hair matters,” Moreira, who is studying criminal justice and is from West Africa, said gesturing to her the afro she was sporting. Moreira said she was fueled by the history of the black experience in the country, from slavery to the image she saw on social media throughout the week. “This country was built on the backbone of black Americans,” she said. “We gave [white America] hundreds of years to fix this.” But, she said, nothing has changed and that scares her. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic,” she said, referring to the coronavirus which has disproportionately affected the African-American community. “And you’re telling me going outside is a trap. I have a brother. I have a dad. If they come out tomorrow will they be dead?” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall weighed in on Twitter as the protest continued. In an attempt to assuage concerns, she said in an open letter that the police department “does not allow the use of technique to head or neck as a form of restraint.” Mendenhall also highlighted policies of accountability and training that the officers go through. She said the department is being proactive and has asked community leaders from Utah’s Black Lives Matter chapter and Utah Against Police Brutality to review and give their input on the department’s training and policies on use of force and restraining techniques. The Last Straw? Also among the protesters was Maliah-Mae Pennington, who is from Minneapolis but happened to be camping in Utah for the past week. Then she started seeing the video and images of Floyd’s death and the subsequent violent protests. “We felt kind of lost knowing we couldn’t support back home because we were so far away,” Pennington said. “So we jumped on the chance to be able to support our city from so far away.” But she warned this isn’t an isolated incident that only Minnesotans have to deal with. Floyd’s death was just the latest event of police brutality. “What happened in Minneapolis isn’t the first time,” she said. “It’s happened many times and no one has been brought to trial. We just got fed up with it and no one started taking us seriously until buildings started burning.” In 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in the city of St. Anthony, northeast of Minneapolis. The officer was acquitted of charges of manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm. The accumulation of events that spurred Saturday’s protest also took a toll on native Utahns like Candace Collins. “Police are supposed to be serving us and protecting us,” Collins said as she fought back tears. “And they’re killing us and that’s not fine. And they need to know we’re sick of it. It’s been happening too long.” As a teacher, she said she also talks to her students so they know what’s going on and don’t perpetuate racial bias. Speaking Up For Floyd That’s the same lesson Kris Ricard, of Lehi, said he tries to pass down to his kids. He has two boys, 7 and 4. His lesson to them is understanding their privilege and making sure they learn that everyone doesn’t have that. “Not everybody gets to go to sleep every night and not worry about what might happen to them the next day,” Ricard said. For Ricard, showing up Saturday was what he and others need to do until there is meaningful change, he said. “I’m here to speak for George Floyd because I get to go home tonight,” he said. “I get to hug my kids tonight. I get to wake up tomorrow. He doesn’t. And the only reason that was him and not me, is because of the color of our skin. And if I don’t speak out against that oppression, who will?”",0.0

Not long after, a “10-33” call went out asking officers throughout the valley to help, and to help quickly. Hundreds of police officers — with sirens and lights flashing — could be seen racing to the downtown area. The governor activated the National Guard, one of 14 governors across the nation to do so Saturday, and the mayor ordered a curfew to start at 8 p.m. that will last through early Monday morning. And just before 9 p.m., police began their march to restore order in Salt Lake City, closing a nearly 11-hour day of protest, violence and restraint in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s curfew edict is in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place, including for the purpose of travel, with the following exceptions: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, News media People traveling to work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling to the airport; patronizing private businesses; seeking medical care; fleeing dangerous circumstances; or experiencing homelessness. Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in a public place for reasons other than these. “The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said as she invoked an 8 p.m. curfew that will extend until 6 a.m. Monday. Dozens were arrested, and several officers injured as well as some demonstrators. But the Beehive State did not see the level of violence experienced in other cities across the U.S. Clearing the city Police, who were joined by officers from multiple agencies across the Wasatch Front, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in two lines that stretched the length of the street and beyond, attempting to push back the crowd that had swelled throughout the day. As night approached, a military helicopter circled overhead, but officers largely stayed in formation downtown and at the state Capitol as protesters continued talking, yelling and chanting. Discarded posters blew across the Capitol lawn, while a lone couple collected discarded water bottles that were left or thrown by protesters. “We are pleading with you to clear the city,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. “We’re not going anywhere. We intend to be on the street. We will enforce the laws.” Police did not aggressively enforce curfew right at 8 p.m., and few protesters had left on their own. By about 8:40 p.m., officers began advancing demonstrators toward City Hall. Some taunted and hurled expletives at officers, while others retreated onto the lawn. By 9 p.m. at the Capitol, an order to disperse was played over a loudspeaker. The crowd began yelling obscenities and some were flipping off the deputies standing in front of them. Others began to leave the way they were told, but about a dozen people sat down on the plaza, showcasing their intent to stay. “It is time to go home,” Brown said. “This is not helping. ... Nothing good can come of this now. This is not helpful. This does not promote the dialogue and conversation we need to have.” Officers in riot gear were seen being treated for what appeared to be minor injuries, mostly heat exhaustion, Brown said. They’d been hit with projectiles and pushed and one was attacked by a protester with a baseball bat. “Had it not been for his helmet, he could have been seriously injured or killed,” the chief said. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced south from 400 South to around 700 South. Officers led many with hands zip-tied into jail transport buses. At least two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave the premises. An attempt to restore peace Mendenhall, who surveyed the area from an Air National Guard helicopter overhead, said no one would be allowed on public streets except law enforcement, news media, medical personnel, and anyone transporting food, traveling to somewhere, patronizing businesses, fleeing danger or experiencing homelessness. “What is happening here does nothing to right past wrongs or rebuild a system that is unjust,” she said. “If you are on Salt Lake City streets right now ... go home. “Stop destroying our city.” Gov. Gary Herbert added, “Make no mistake, we’ll do whatever is necessary to restore order to our capital city, to Salt Lake.” Recently retired Pastor France A. Davis, of the Calvary Baptist Church on State Street, said, “We are all part of this community. There’s no use anybody destroying any of it.” He pleaded with people to protest more effectively. “It’s OK to be frustrated,” Rev. Davis said. “Do all you can, but do it nonviolently.” At one point, a man showed up with a bow and arrow and allegedly aimed it at protesters just before he was attacked by a group of people. That man, who is known to police, was taken away injured and bloodied from the scene as protesters then flipped and looted his car and set it on fire. Explosions could be heard from blocks away and dark smoke billowed into the air. The man later returned and got into a verbal argument with protesters. “I came down here originally to help the cops,” the man said. “But, all I did was yell out, ‘All lives matter’ and I got beat up by black people.” It was a scene similar to the final night of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City when officers in riot gear used similar tactics — with shields and rubber bullets — to push a large crowd that refused to disperse out of the city. Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera and many of her officers and deputies were on scene to assist and they brought a bus and other vehicles to transport arrested protesters to the Salt Lake County Jail. “We just need peace. Too many people are getting hurt. I’m willing to come to the table with whoever wants to come and talk to me about the issues. Especially with what’s going on nationwide,” she said. “I get it. I’m a person of color as well and I get it. I’m happy to listen. I’m happy to make changes. But this is not how we do that,” Rivera said. She said the Unified Police Department has been doing all it can to make sure its officers are as diverse as our communities. “And it helps. But we need to communicate and listen, not just communicate. We have to learn to listen and be willing to make those changes and I’m happy to do so,” she said. Unsafe conditions Father Paul Truebenbach, of St. Peter and Paul Orthodox Christian Church in Salt Lake City, was at the protest to protect the church near the 7-Eleven that was looted at 400 South and 300 East. He said he asked officers if he should hold church services Sunday, to mixed reaction from police. “This idea of social justice is so dangerous because it seeks to change everything around you. In orthodox, it is the opposite, it seeks to change us. You can’t change what you don’t have,” Father Truebenbach said. He said about a half-dozen people will be guarding the church through the night and no decision had been made about services. Jacenta Morris, 36, a black woman from Salt Lake City, said she came to protest with her family, to be a part of history she hopes will result in change. But the violence that ensued disturbed her. “I think this is too much. I think they should calm down and do it a different way than rioting,” she said. “I worry about my sons, I have two boys,” Morris said. “Anything could happen to them, they could be walking down the street and anything could happen.” Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, pleaded with people to stop the violence. “We understand the frustration and anger of those protesting,” she said, adding that the protest started out OK, but “the conversation changed.” “Nobody will remember why we were here,” Hollins said. The original message opposing systematic racism, she said, will be overshadowed by violence. “The solution is not burning down a city.” Grid View A police vehicle drives near a burning car as people protest police brutality in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

Allred, Deseret News Disordered destruction At least two police vehicles were destroyed or suffered heavy damage. In addition to an unoccupied Salt Lake patrol car being overturned and burned, another unmarked police vehicle had its windows smashed out. Other vehicles parked nearby were vandalized as well, including a news media vehicle, which bore the painted words: “Stop protecting them.” After a couple of hours of letting protesters get their frustrations out, police in riot gear and armored vehicles started to form a perimeter around the library and systematically move people out of the area. TRAX service in the downtown area was halted about 5 p.m. and travelers were encouraged to avoid the area. Protesters knelt in front of a line of officers wearing riot gear outside the Salt Lake Main Library just after 5 p.m. Behind them was a burnt out and vandalized police car that hours earlier, protesters had pushed on its top, beat out the windows and started on fire. An @slcpd car just got overturned at the #GeorgeFloyd protest in Salt Lake City. pic.twitter.com/iFpEmpkyEq — Jacob Klopfenstein (@JFKlopfenstein) May 30, 2020 Another large group of protesters shouting and holding signs convened at the Utah Capitol, where a line of troopers from the Utah Highway Patrol stood, not letting them get close to the building. Looting was reported at a 7-Eleven near the library, although there was also a video of protesters intervening and pleading with others not to steal or destroy property. Jay Barton said he was inspired by a former military man who yelled at the protesters, telling them their actions were hurting their cause. Barton said the unidentified man was telling him he felt inspired to come downtown Saturday when suddenly a group of protesters ran toward the convenience store, broke windows and started stealing beer and other items. “This man immediately walked up front and started yelling at the people who shattered the glass. His words where inspiring. Truly a beautiful moment.” “This isn’t the answer. This is what they want. They want us against each other,” the man yelled. “You need to be against every single person who’s turned this into a criminal activity. … This isn’t right.” Police were also seen responding to reports of vandalism at City Creek Center mall. It was not immediately clear whether anything was stolen. Large rocks and fireworks were thrown at police in riot gear as protesters chanted phrases such as “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can’t breathe.” A woman also attempted to attack several protesters with a hammer, hitting another woman who declined medical assistance, Salt Lake Police Sgt. Keith Horrocks said. Protesters wrestled the hammer from the woman, Horrocks said, and she ran off before police could find her. Fighting for change Katie Allen Yazzie, a 17-year-old Navajo girl, attended the rally with a sign that said, “My skin is not a weapon.” “Me being a person of color does not mean that the police should be scared of me or of anyone who has the color of my skin or darker. It’s to the point that I’m scared of police in general. I don’t want them around me because they’re not good to me,” she said. Her mother, Christine Allen, attended on Saturday with her. She said officers have helped her in the past and she respects them, but believes all people aren’t treated equally. “I think that a society is only as good as the people who are the most vulnerable are treated,” she said. “We have to stand up for each other because people of color don’t’ have a police force they can rely on. They have to rely on the community. They have to rely on each other.” Ishjon Hawkins, 30, of New Orleans, said he joined the protest because of the way he feels police have treated him in the past. “Me being a black man, growing up, I had a lot of run-ins with the police and they’re aggressive. They abuse their authority,” he said. “We want change. We need different laws.” Asked if he has issues with police in general or just some officers, Hawkins said, “Honestly, it’s white police. It’s just like they’ve got it out for us. … I don’t get it.” Marvin Oliveros was at the protest and encouraged people to continue protesting. Belgard’s step-brother, Cody Paris Belgard, 30, was shot and killed by five Salt Lake police officers in December 2018. The shooting was later determined to be justified by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Oliveros said he understands better than anyone what Floyd’s family is going through. “I know the pain they’re going through. I know the answers they’re searching for,” he said, encouraging protesters to “keep up the pressure” so all victims of police brutality are remembered. “While we were devastated to hear what happened to George Floyd — and make no mistake: we condemn what happened on all counts — we were saddened today to see the violence and riots here in Salt Lake City,” Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Lexi Cunningham said. She said police were using East High School as a staging area to respond to the protests, which erupted in pockets all over the city after dark. “We urge all community members to continue the fight to end systemic racism, to look for peaceful ways to improve communities daily, and here in Salt Lake City, we urge you to please be safe and follow the curfew established by Mayor Mendenhall,” Cunningham said.

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News Standing their ground The exterior of the state Capitol was vandalized, as was the stone retaining wall near the street. At one point, two people with cans of spray paint wrote obscenities on the walkway and granite pillars, but just as a trooper moved to shoo them away, another waved him back to the line of officers on the last set of steps leading into the Capitol’s front doors. The officers, most of whom stood stone-faced as protesters yelled questions or obscenities at them, were from several agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Office and the Utah Highway Patrol. Some officers engaged in conversations with protesters, including discussions of race, history and philosophy. Among those talking with officers was Rae Duckworth, who lost her cousin Bobby Duckworth in September 2019 to an officer-involved shooting in Wellington, Carbon County. She said she was there with Black Lives Matter and Utahns Against Police Brutality. “We’re just here peacefully protesting ... and I just really want to have conversations,” the 28-year-old Salt Lake County woman said. “I really think transparency and communication are two big issues. We don’t know what law enforcement does. We know they police themselves, and that doesn’t do anything good or valuable for the community.” She said several officers engaged in conversations, and she felt most of them were productive. She pointed out that at least one said he’d meet with local Black Lives Matter leaders to discuss what kinds of change would restore trust and confidence in policing for those who feel unfairly targeted. “They even have their opinions about George Floyd, that they’re brave enough to speak up about,” she said. “And they’ve also told me that they actually speak up against racism in their own departments, which is a step that needs to be taken.” One officer said he was married to a person of color, and he told her he thought it would be helpful to him as he raises four mixed-race children. “I think one of them actually felt this movement,” Duckworth said. “Versus the other ones who stand there like brick walls or statues.” Some people were passing by and decided to join the line of officers standing on the bottom stair of the Capitol steps, including one man who said, “I’m here to protect the people’s house.” One black man engaged in an hourlong conversation about institutional racism with a number of those standing with police, including a firefighter and a Native American teenager. The small conversation expanded as a Hispanic man passing by added his thoughts, and the group jumped from slavery to genocide to the lack of educational opportunities and whether the protests accomplished anything important. As he rode away on a scooter about 7 p.m., a police officer yelled to him, “Awesome.” Clouds moved in and some rain fell, but the crowd thinned and then swelled throughout the afternoon and evening. At one point, protesters threw water bottles, rocks and other items at police. Earlier in the afternoon, while the protest was calm, people spoke about why they were there. “As a country, I just feel broken, and I feel scared for everyone in the black community. I just feel that our country is just not letting us live our lives, and innocent people are being killed for no reason,” Savanah Norman said, becoming emotional in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building.

Laura Seitz, Deseret News Related Deseret News reporter and his wife explore the perils of being black in America “I do feel a lot of support today here. Seeing a lot of people come out is very liberating and exciting to see, because I think, here in Utah, there is still a lot of racism. And so I’m really happy that people came out to show support,” Norman said. “I just think we’re at our last straw,” she said. “This is it. People are fed up, and they have every right to be. And I think this murder of George Floyd, everyone is just done. We’re done.” A show of solidarity Early on, the protest remained relatively uneventful, with even some children out with their parents to call for justice for Floyd. The protest had originally been planned as a vehicle caravan, with participants discouraged from rallying outside of their cars. Organizers asked for the protesters to maintain physical distance from others. Thousands of people in vehicles circled the Salt Lake City Police Department, many waving signs from their windows that said slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd,” with others decrying racism and calling for police reform. “I feel like I know what my ancestors went through in the 1960s, and it’s sad that here in 2020, we’re still saying, ‘I can’t believe this. We’re saying, ‘black lives matter.’ This isn’t the first time a black man has been killed like this,” Zala Long told the Deseret News. “It’s good because I feel like we’re showing the world, and we’re showing the SLCPD that we see them and we’re watching them, and we’re letting our voices be heard. I feel a lot of empathy, I feel a lot of sadness, but also I’m glad that we’re saying their names. We’re saying George Floyd, we’re saying ... Ahmed Arbery. We’re not going to forget about them. We care about them, because if we don’t, then no one else will,” she promised. She said she feels the Floyd case is getting more attention than others. “But I feel like we’ve been at the tipping point for years. we’re tired of fighting for our rights, but we’re going to fight for our rights,” she said, explaining that she believes the police force needs to be restructured to root out systemic racism. “The question isn’t who’s next, it’s when is he next. When am I next, when is she next, when are my brothers next, when is my mom next, when is my dad next?” Naia James added. Within an hour, cars packed the streets, creating a standstill in traffic downtown, and thousands also marched on foot chanting “We can’t breathe,” making their way up to the state Capitol. Beth Jennings and her family lived in Minneapolis before moving to Utah, and says she has friends there who are being impacted by the turmoil. “We just wanted to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis right now against police violence,” Jennings said. Haizel Jennings, 10, said of Floyd’s death: “I feel like it’s sort of unhumanizing of that cop because I feel like it’s sort of human right to try, if at some point you could stop someone dying, to stop it. It’s part of human rights, I think.” “I would hope all of us will stand tall for the issues of civil rights,” Herbert said. “What we see today is not typical Utah behavior. We’re better than that here in Utah.” Contributing: Annie Knox, Alex Cabrero",0.0

1621220312,2020-05-30 21:01:32,Salt Lake Issues Citywide Curfew Until Monday Morning After Protests Turn Violent,https://www.kuer.org/post/salt-lake-issues-citywide-curfew-until-monday-morning-after-protests-turn-violent,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated 11:00 p.m. MDT 5/30/2020 A citywide curfew enacted by Salt Lake City to quell violence after a day of protest against police brutality went into effect Saturday night, as police advanced on demonstrators, pushing them south from downtown Salt Lake City. As a helicopter circled overhead, gunshots could occasionally be heard amid moments of chaos when a line of police and National Guard troops charged toward the few hundred remaining people who had gathered around the east lawn of the Salt Lake City and County Building. People hurled bottles, rocks and other projectiles at riot police and SWAT members, who responded with less-than-lethal force, firing several bean bag rounds at demonstrators, hitting one man in the eye. Exact numbers of arrests were not immediately available, but were likely to be in the dozens as police ramped up efforts to enforce the curfew around 10 p.m. Police had parked a large white bus to transport arrested demonstrators. Nine officers received medical treatment, mostly for heat exhaustion but also stemming from an attack with a baseball bat. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown implored people to comply with the curfew and return home during a press conference called shortly after 9 p.m. “It is time to go home. This is not helping. Please, parents: call her your kids and get them back home. Nothing good can come from this now,” Brown said. “We will be arresting those who do not comply.” Mendenhall set the curfew from 8 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Monday, but in comments to reporters Saturday night said it could end early if people comply with the order. The curfew came in response to protests, triggered by the recent in-custody death of a black man in Minneapolis, that sparked more violence. At the press conference Brown addressed the death of George Floyd, and offered condolences to the man's family. He also lamented the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's death. “We look at this as a very disturbing situation, because those four officers have put us in this situation.” Brown said. “They have undone the great work that so many law enforcement officers and agencies have tried to instill and build relationships over the last four years."" Salt Lake City police tweeted asking people to follow the curfew due to “the amount of assets focused on the protest.” The department said managing the protest “has diverted critical resources from other parts of the city.” Gov. Gary Herbert earlier in the day activated up to 200 National Guardsmen in support of crowd control, with the Air National Guard arriving Saturday night. Earlier in the evening police intermittently clashed with some members of the crowd, who largely gathered near the main City Library at 400 S and 200 E. before the curfew went into effect. One police officer was hospitalized after being hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat. The officer was wearing a helmet when he was hit, Brown said. Two other officers were being treated at an area hospital for heat exhaustion as the day’s temperatures had climbed into the 90s, and six others were treated for the same issue at a local fire station. But the aggression was not only between demonstrators and police. In one incident, a man wielding a bow and crying out “All Lives Matter” began to draw an arrow before a crowd descended upon him and set his car ablaze, according to reports and video posted to Twitter showed. Oluwa Funmilayo had been protesting since 5 p.m. and was still out about a half hour before the curfew took effect. She said the reason she’s out is simple, she’s just sick of black men dying at the hands of cops. “So far it's a mix of people who are here actually trying to show that we’re not gonna stand for injustice for the black community,” Funmilayo said. “And then there are people who are trying to incite anxiety and angst among all these people.” Law enforcement from West Valley City, South Jordan and Ogden were also on hand to help curb the violence. The Salt Lake City school district announced it would allow police to use East High School as a temporary staging site. The curfew followed a morning of peaceful protests against police brutality that turned violent with protesters smashing police cars, overturning one and setting it on fire. Herbert, Mendenhall and Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown announced the curfew during a virtual news conference Saturday evening. They were joined by the Rev. France Davis, the retired pastor of Salt Lake City’s Calvary Baptist Church. “We join with those who demand change and are ready to work together,” Mendenhall said during the news conference. “The unfortunate choice of some to inflict destruction and chaos does nothing to right past wrongs.” More than a thousand people on foot and a car caravan started Saturday morning and looped around the Salt Lake City Police Department building before heading up to the state capitol. “Unfortunately what I’ve seen in the last few hours is that it’s gone from a peaceful protest to just criminal behavior,” Herbert said. “We’ve got to call it what it is: criminal behavior. People are looking to riot, to loot to create violence and that’s not acceptable.” Utah’s ethnic and minority legislators held a press conference Saturday evening as well to comment on the situation that was unfolding downtown. “As legislators, we encourage people who choose to protest to stay safe, respect property, and respect social distancing,” they said in a joint statement. “We will continue pressing for reforms to our criminal justice system, de-escalation training for law enforcement, and more accountability and transparency from law enforcement and government officials.“ University of Utah Health announced it would be closing COVID-19 testing sites in Sugarhouse and Redwood due to the curfew. Testing locations in South Jordan, Farmington and Park City will remain open.",0.0

1621225860,2020-05-30 20:52:32,U.S. cities fear protests may fuel new wave of virus outbreaks,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/5/30/21275838/george-floyd-protests-coronavirus-pandemic,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"LOS ANGELES — The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have sent shudders through the health community and elevated fears that the huge crowds will lead to a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday evening. “There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Minnesota’s governor said too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.” The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced Saturday in Paris when unions flouted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions for workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 368,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic. ___ Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

Gary Herbert (@GovHerbert) May 30, 2020 According to Ben Winslow, on Twitter tear gas was thrown into the crowds. After the release of a video of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, being murdered by Minneapolis police, protests sparked all over the country. On May 30, in downtown Salt Lake City, protestors hopped into cars and marched the streets demanding justice for Black Lives across America. Protesters gathered at a parking lot at 500 South and Denver St. handing out signs and prepared to head out to the streets. Protester Rae Duckworth spoke about her experience with police brutality in her life and what it meant to find a community with the Black Lives Matter movement in Salt Lake City as an adult. Duckworth’s cousin, Bobby Duckworth was shot by a police officer in Utah after her family called the police expressing concerns for Bobby’s mental health. She said her family had a fear he was going to hurt himself. Rae Duckworth described her cousin as a big giant Black kid, but a teddy bear and a total sweetheart. “You can tell from the body cam footage, [the officer] was scared and he was scared that a Black man was approaching him after he had just told him to come toward him,” she said. “And he gave my cousin six or seven bullets.” After her personal experience with police brutality, Rae Duckworth decided to get involved with the Black Lives Matter chapter in Utah. She said even though Utah is majority white, there are still chapters here. “I’m 28 years old and if I knew this establishment was here when I was a kid, I would have felt a lot more comfortable growing up,” she said. Among the protestors were Naia James and Zela Long, who were at the rally to bring awareness to the cause. “Being Black in America does something to your mind, when you see people who look like you and talk like you dying on the streets,” Long said. Long said they attended to protest the corrupt police system, she said there cannot be a good police officer in the system. “The system isn’t broke, it’s doing what it’s supposed to do which is oppress people of color and kill people of color,” she said. “So to be honest the system needs to be shut down and completely rebuilt.” “They’re being watched, everything they do is under a microscope because they are killing multiple of us and now we are not sitting still,” James said. While the protest may have been sparked by other protests for George Flloyd and Breona Taylor, they also highlighted police brutality against people in Utah specifically. Chants were led calling for justice for Bernardo Palacios who was shot and killed in Rose Park, Utah last Saturday. Protesters also yelled for justice for Richie Santiago, Patrick Harmon, Dillon Taylor, Elijah James Smith and James Dudley-Parker, who were all killed in Utah by Utah police. Carly Halderman, a member of Utah against police brutality, said the disproportionate killing of people of color in an 80% white state such as Utah “is not a coincidence, that’s institutional racism.” The cars protesting surrounded and circled the Salt Lake City Police Department as they honked and shouted Black Lives Matter. The cars were decorated with a variety of statements and protestors hung out the windows with their fists up to show solidarity with the movement. One person stood in the bed of his trunk and flew a white flag that read ‘All Cops Are Bastards,’ a popular statement meant to emphasize the opinion that the police system is corrupt and therefore no cops can be considered good. Protesters marched through the streets through the City Library to gather at the Salt Lake Police Department where some protesters wrote on the walls and jumped on the building leading chants of “No justice, no peace.” There were no visual cops on sight of the protest. Protesters then headed to the state capitol chanting, “Cops and Klan go hand in hand.” Despite organizers’ plans to encourage social distancing and for people to stay in their cars, protestors gathered in large crowds and marched next to each other disregarding the six-feet apart rule. There were traffic jams located in the downtown area as protesters hung out of their cars and honked through the streets demanding justice. Malinda Peschong, who is from Minnesota, has been traveling with her children across the country for the past couple of months and learned about the protest online. Peschong said she was surprised and warmed by the people in Utah and the white allies that showed up in support. Peschong said while she’s been in Utah, her black son has not left her sight because she is scared for his safety. Peschong said those who showed up put change in her heart and reminded her there is good everywhere even when they don’t see it. As the protests continue, she said she hopes people will learn and change, that it isn’t all in vain. “We’re absolutely freaking fed up, we’re hurt, we’re angry, and we’re tired,” Peschong said. “We’re tired of the injustice for ourselves, we’re tired of the injustice for our children.” [email protected] @natalie__news [email protected] @lanavanna",0.0

Not long after, a “10-33” call went out asking officers throughout the valley to help, and to help quickly. Hundreds of police officers — with sirens and lights flashing — could be seen racing to the downtown area. The governor activated the National Guard, one of 14 governors across the nation to do so Saturday, and the mayor ordered a curfew to start at 8 p.m. that will last through early Monday morning. And just before 9 p.m., police began their march to restore order in Salt Lake City, closing a nearly 11-hour day of protest, violence and restraint in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s curfew edict is in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place, including for the purpose of travel, with the following exceptions: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, News media People traveling to work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling to the airport; patronizing private businesses; seeking medical care; fleeing dangerous circumstances; or experiencing homelessness. Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in a public place for reasons other than these. “The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said as she invoked an 8 p.m. curfew that will extend until 6 a.m. Monday. Dozens were arrested, and several officers injured as well as some demonstrators. But the Beehive State did not see the level of violence experienced in other cities across the U.S. Clearing the city Police, who were joined by officers from multiple agencies across the Wasatch Front, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in two lines that stretched the length of the street and beyond, attempting to push back the crowd that had swelled throughout the day. As night approached, a military helicopter circled overhead, but officers largely stayed in formation downtown and at the state Capitol as protesters continued talking, yelling and chanting. Discarded posters blew across the Capitol lawn, while a lone couple collected discarded water bottles that were left or thrown by protesters. “We are pleading with you to clear the city,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. “We’re not going anywhere. We intend to be on the street. We will enforce the laws.” Police did not aggressively enforce curfew right at 8 p.m., and few protesters had left on their own. By about 8:40 p.m., officers began advancing demonstrators toward City Hall. Some taunted and hurled expletives at officers, while others retreated onto the lawn. By 9 p.m. at the Capitol, an order to disperse was played over a loudspeaker. The crowd began yelling obscenities and some were flipping off the deputies standing in front of them. Others began to leave the way they were told, but about a dozen people sat down on the plaza, showcasing their intent to stay. “It is time to go home,” Brown said. “This is not helping. ... Nothing good can come of this now. This is not helpful. This does not promote the dialogue and conversation we need to have.” Officers in riot gear were seen being treated for what appeared to be minor injuries, mostly heat exhaustion, Brown said. They’d been hit with projectiles and pushed and one was attacked by a protester with a baseball bat. “Had it not been for his helmet, he could have been seriously injured or killed,” the chief said. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced south from 400 South to around 700 South. Officers led many with hands zip-tied into jail transport buses. At least two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave the premises. An attempt to restore peace Mendenhall, who surveyed the area from an Air National Guard helicopter overhead, said no one would be allowed on public streets except law enforcement, news media, medical personnel, and anyone transporting food, traveling to somewhere, patronizing businesses, fleeing danger or experiencing homelessness. “What is happening here does nothing to right past wrongs or rebuild a system that is unjust,” she said. “If you are on Salt Lake City streets right now ... go home. “Stop destroying our city.” Gov. Gary Herbert added, “Make no mistake, we’ll do whatever is necessary to restore order to our capital city, to Salt Lake.” Recently retired Pastor France A. Davis, of the Calvary Baptist Church on State Street, said, “We are all part of this community. There’s no use anybody destroying any of it.” He pleaded with people to protest more effectively. “It’s OK to be frustrated,” Rev. Davis said. “Do all you can, but do it nonviolently.” At one point, a man showed up with a bow and arrow and allegedly aimed it at protesters just before he was attacked by a group of people. That man, who is known to police, was taken away injured and bloodied from the scene as protesters then flipped and looted his car and set it on fire. Explosions could be heard from blocks away and dark smoke billowed into the air. The man later returned and got into a verbal argument with protesters. “I came down here originally to help the cops,” the man said. “But, all I did was yell out, ‘All lives matter’ and I got beat up by black people.” It was a scene similar to the final night of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City when officers in riot gear used similar tactics — with shields and rubber bullets — to push a large crowd that refused to disperse out of the city. Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera and many of her officers and deputies were on scene to assist and they brought a bus and other vehicles to transport arrested protesters to the Salt Lake County Jail. “We just need peace. Too many people are getting hurt. I’m willing to come to the table with whoever wants to come and talk to me about the issues. Especially with what’s going on nationwide,” she said. “I get it. I’m a person of color as well and I get it. I’m happy to listen. I’m happy to make changes. But this is not how we do that,” Rivera said. She said the Unified Police Department has been doing all it can to make sure its officers are as diverse as our communities. “And it helps. But we need to communicate and listen, not just communicate. We have to learn to listen and be willing to make those changes and I’m happy to do so,” she said. Unsafe conditions Father Paul Truebenbach, of St. Peter and Paul Orthodox Christian Church in Salt Lake City, was at the protest to protect the church near the 7-Eleven that was looted at 400 South and 300 East. He said he asked officers if he should hold church services Sunday, to mixed reaction from police. “This idea of social justice is so dangerous because it seeks to change everything around you. In orthodox, it is the opposite, it seeks to change us. You can’t change what you don’t have,” Father Truebenbach said. He said about a half-dozen people will be guarding the church through the night and no decision had been made about services. Jacenta Morris, 36, a black woman from Salt Lake City, said she came to protest with her family, to be a part of history she hopes will result in change. But the violence that ensued disturbed her. “I think this is too much. I think they should calm down and do it a different way than rioting,” she said. “I worry about my sons, I have two boys,” Morris said. “Anything could happen to them, they could be walking down the street and anything could happen.” Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, pleaded with people to stop the violence. “We understand the frustration and anger of those protesting,” she said, adding that the protest started out OK, but “the conversation changed.” “Nobody will remember why we were here,” Hollins said. The original message opposing systematic racism, she said, will be overshadowed by violence. “The solution is not burning down a city.” Grid View A police vehicle drives near a burning car as people protest police brutality in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

Allred, Deseret News Disordered destruction At least two police vehicles were destroyed or suffered heavy damage. In addition to an unoccupied Salt Lake patrol car being overturned and burned, another unmarked police vehicle had its windows smashed out. Other vehicles parked nearby were vandalized as well, including a news media vehicle, which bore the painted words: “Stop protecting them.” After a couple of hours of letting protesters get their frustrations out, police in riot gear and armored vehicles started to form a perimeter around the library and systematically move people out of the area. TRAX service in the downtown area was halted about 5 p.m. and travelers were encouraged to avoid the area. Protesters knelt in front of a line of officers wearing riot gear outside the Salt Lake Main Library just after 5 p.m. Behind them was a burnt out and vandalized police car that hours earlier, protesters had pushed on its top, beat out the windows and started on fire.

Looting was reported at a 7-Eleven near the library, although there was also a video of protesters intervening and pleading with others not to steal or destroy property. Jay Barton said he was inspired by a former military man who yelled at the protesters, telling them their actions were hurting their cause. Barton said the unidentified man was telling him he felt inspired to come downtown Saturday when suddenly a group of protesters ran toward the convenience store, broke windows and started stealing beer and other items. “This man immediately walked up front and started yelling at the people who shattered the glass. His words where inspiring. Truly a beautiful moment.” “This isn’t the answer. This is what they want. They want us against each other,” the man yelled. “You need to be against every single person who’s turned this into a criminal activity. … This isn’t right.” Police were also seen responding to reports of vandalism at City Creek Center mall. It was not immediately clear whether anything was stolen. Large rocks and fireworks were thrown at police in riot gear as protesters chanted phrases such as “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can’t breathe.” A woman also attempted to attack several protesters with a hammer, hitting another woman who declined medical assistance, Salt Lake Police Sgt. Keith Horrocks said. Protesters wrestled the hammer from the woman, Horrocks said, and she ran off before police could find her. Fighting for change Katie Allen Yazzie, a 17-year-old Navajo girl, attended the rally with a sign that said, “My skin is not a weapon.” “Me being a person of color does not mean that the police should be scared of me or of anyone who has the color of my skin or darker. It’s to the point that I’m scared of police in general. I don’t want them around me because they’re not good to me,” she said. Her mother, Christine Allen, attended on Saturday with her. She said officers have helped her in the past and she respects them, but believes all people aren’t treated equally. “I think that a society is only as good as the people who are the most vulnerable are treated,” she said. “We have to stand up for each other because people of color don’t’ have a police force they can rely on. They have to rely on the community. They have to rely on each other.” Ishjon Hawkins, 30, of New Orleans, said he joined the protest because of the way he feels police have treated him in the past. “Me being a black man, growing up, I had a lot of run-ins with the police and they’re aggressive. They abuse their authority,” he said. “We want change. We need different laws.” Asked if he has issues with police in general or just some officers, Hawkins said, “Honestly, it’s white police. It’s just like they’ve got it out for us. … I don’t get it.” Marvin Oliveros was at the protest and encouraged people to continue protesting. Belgard’s step-brother, Cody Paris Belgard, 30, was shot and killed by five Salt Lake police officers in December 2018. The shooting was later determined to be justified by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Oliveros said he understands better than anyone what Floyd’s family is going through. “I know the pain they’re going through. I know the answers they’re searching for,” he said, encouraging protesters to “keep up the pressure” so all victims of police brutality are remembered. “While we were devastated to hear what happened to George Floyd — and make no mistake: we condemn what happened on all counts — we were saddened today to see the violence and riots here in Salt Lake City,” Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Lexi Cunningham said. She said police were using East High School as a staging area to respond to the protests, which erupted in pockets all over the city after dark. “We urge all community members to continue the fight to end systemic racism, to look for peaceful ways to improve communities daily, and here in Salt Lake City, we urge you to please be safe and follow the curfew established by Mayor Mendenhall,” Cunningham said.

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News Standing their ground The exterior of the state Capitol was vandalized, as was the stone retaining wall near the street. At one point, two people with cans of spray paint wrote obscenities on the walkway and granite pillars, but just as a trooper moved to shoo them away, another waved him back to the line of officers on the last set of steps leading into the Capitol’s front doors. The officers, most of whom stood stone-faced as protesters yelled questions or obscenities at them, were from several agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Office and the Utah Highway Patrol. Some officers engaged in conversations with protesters, including discussions of race, history and philosophy. Among those talking with officers was Rae Duckworth, who lost her cousin Bobby Duckworth in September 2019 to an officer-involved shooting in Wellington, Carbon County. She said she was there with Black Lives Matter and Utahns Against Police Brutality. “We’re just here peacefully protesting ... and I just really want to have conversations,” the 28-year-old Salt Lake County woman said. “I really think transparency and communication are two big issues. We don’t know what law enforcement does. We know they police themselves, and that doesn’t do anything good or valuable for the community.” She said several officers engaged in conversations, and she felt most of them were productive. She pointed out that at least one said he’d meet with local Black Lives Matter leaders to discuss what kinds of change would restore trust and confidence in policing for those who feel unfairly targeted. “They even have their opinions about George Floyd, that they’re brave enough to speak up about,” she said. “And they’ve also told me that they actually speak up against racism in their own departments, which is a step that needs to be taken.” One officer said he was married to a person of color, and he told her he thought it would be helpful to him as he raises four mixed-race children. “I think one of them actually felt this movement,” Duckworth said. “Versus the other ones who stand there like brick walls or statues.” Some people were passing by and decided to join the line of officers standing on the bottom stair of the Capitol steps, including one man who said, “I’m here to protect the people’s house.” One black man engaged in an hourlong conversation about institutional racism with a number of those standing with police, including a firefighter and a Native American teenager. The small conversation expanded as a Hispanic man passing by added his thoughts, and the group jumped from slavery to genocide to the lack of educational opportunities and whether the protests accomplished anything important. As he rode away on a scooter about 7 p.m., a police officer yelled to him, “Awesome.” Clouds moved in and some rain fell, but the crowd thinned and then swelled throughout the afternoon and evening. At one point, protesters threw water bottles, rocks and other items at police. Earlier in the afternoon, while the protest was calm, people spoke about why they were there. “As a country, I just feel broken, and I feel scared for everyone in the black community. I just feel that our country is just not letting us live our lives, and innocent people are being killed for no reason,” Savanah Norman said, becoming emotional in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building.

Seeing a lot of people come out is very liberating and exciting to see, because I think, here in Utah, there is still a lot of racism. And so I’m really happy that people came out to show support,” Norman said. “I just think we’re at our last straw,” she said. “This is it. People are fed up, and they have every right to be. And I think this murder of George Floyd, everyone is just done. We’re done.” A show of solidarity Early on, the protest remained relatively uneventful, with even some children out with their parents to call for justice for Floyd. The protest had originally been planned as a vehicle caravan, with participants discouraged from rallying outside of their cars. Organizers asked for the protesters to maintain physical distance from others. Thousands of people in vehicles circled the Salt Lake City Police Department, many waving signs from their windows that said slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd,” with others decrying racism and calling for police reform. “I feel like I know what my ancestors went through in the 1960s, and it’s sad that here in 2020, we’re still saying, ‘I can’t believe this. We’re saying, ‘black lives matter.’ This isn’t the first time a black man has been killed like this,” Zala Long told the Deseret News. “It’s good because I feel like we’re showing the world, and we’re showing the SLCPD that we see them and we’re watching them, and we’re letting our voices be heard. I feel a lot of empathy, I feel a lot of sadness, but also I’m glad that we’re saying their names. We’re saying George Floyd, we’re saying ... Ahmed Arbery. We’re not going to forget about them. We care about them, because if we don’t, then no one else will,” she promised. She said she feels the Floyd case is getting more attention than others. “But I feel like we’ve been at the tipping point for years. we’re tired of fighting for our rights, but we’re going to fight for our rights,” she said, explaining that she believes the police force needs to be restructured to root out systemic racism. “The question isn’t who’s next, it’s when is he next. When am I next, when is she next, when are my brothers next, when is my mom next, when is my dad next?” Naia James added. Within an hour, cars packed the streets, creating a standstill in traffic downtown, and thousands also marched on foot chanting “We can’t breathe,” making their way up to the state Capitol. Beth Jennings and her family lived in Minneapolis before moving to Utah, and says she has friends there who are being impacted by the turmoil. “We just wanted to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis right now against police violence,” Jennings said. Haizel Jennings, 10, said of Floyd’s death: “I feel like it’s sort of unhumanizing of that cop because I feel like it’s sort of human right to try, if at some point you could stop someone dying, to stop it. It’s part of human rights, I think.” “I would hope all of us will stand tall for the issues of civil rights,” Herbert said. “What we see today is not typical Utah behavior. We’re better than that here in Utah.” Contributing: Annie Knox, Alex Cabrero",0.0

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah’s governor activated the National Guard on Saturday in an attempt to restore order after protesters set fire to a police car and vandalized a police station and the state Capitol. Gov. Gary Herbert wrote on Twitter late afternoon that he was deploying troops “to help control the escalating situation.” “We condemn violence and looting,” Herbert wrote, adding, “I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Later, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall announced a curfew lasting from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Graffiti was also written on the state Capitol. Later in the afternoon, protesters flipped over a police vehicle and set it on fire. Men carrying rifles stood on top of the wreckage. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Others marched through downtown Salt Lake City to the state Capitol chanting, “We can’t breathe,” which Floyd said while he was in police custody. A separate rally in Ogden drew about 1,000 people, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. “(We want to do) anything we can do as a people to stop the systematic bias and racism against people of color in our nation that’s gone on for 400 years,” Ogden resident Keyvin VanDyke said.

Update May 31, 1 p.m. Additional context and corrections added to quotes. The protest is one of a handful held throughout the day around the downtown area that drew large crowds, including one at St. George City Hall earlier in the day billed as the “Take a Knee” demonstration under the #BlackLivesMatter movement. St. George Police estimated 200 people were at the Boulevard protest Saturday evening. The earlier protest at City Hall had between 50 to 60 participants. Protesters held signs saying, “No Justice, No Peace” and “He Couldn’t Breathe,” in reference to Floyd, who died Monday after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air in Minneapolis, Minnesota. St. George News reporters on scene at both the evening and morning protests observed a peaceful, if passionate, assembly. Some police officers were stationed in the area. A handful of counter-protesters, expressing support for the St. George Police and that “All Lives Matter” also gathered nearby. A majority of the protest, which began around 5 p.m., dispersed for the most part around 9 p.m. with a few dozen remaining until about 10 p.m. Unlike the protests in Salt Lake City to the north and countless other cities nationwide, the only violent incident in St. George came when a passing motorist threw a firecracker in the middle of the street protesters interpreted as an attack. Other than some loud yelling back from protesters, the incident didn’t escalate further. St. George Police were on standby nearby but didn’t make a visual presence beyond a pair of bicycle officers. Officers also accompanied St. George Mayor Jon Pike as he arrived and spoke with some of the protesters. The racial and age makeup of the protest was multicultural and millenial, whith young white men holding “Black Lives Matter” signs and older African American women yelling “I can’t breathe.” Protesters alternated between yelling “Say his name, George Floyd,” “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace.” A majority of passing motorists honked their approval, while others either yelled out “All lives matter” or obscenities at the protesters. Diamond Sluka, a St. George nursing assistant, came to the protest because of what she said were personal experiences with harassment by police officers in St. George. “I’m tired. I just want to feel safe,” Sluka, an African American, said. “That I have to feel that way is ridiculously stupid.” She said while she was doing her nursing job one day, after a person called in and “told the police that someone who was black was in their neighborhood and did not look like she belonged.” “And the police came out and after I explained I was there for work, the neighbors were aware I would be there for work, the police said if they got another call they would still harass me about it,” Sluka said. Sluka recounted another incident during a cold January morning where she was using a knife to scrape ice off the windshield of her car in front of her home because she did not have an ice pick. “A person who knew I lived here decided I did not belong because I’m black and called police and told them I was trying to break into my home, even though they knew I lived there,” Sluka said. “When the officer saw I had a knife, he acted as if he was scared of me. After seeing what I was doing with the knife and laughing at the irony of me needing to scrape off my windows in St. George where it is almost always way too hot, he decided to call back-up on me even though I wasn’t being violent in any shape or form. And when they showed up they had their hands on their guns, ready to draw on me at any point in time.” She said all three of the officers saw texts from her then-boyfriend and acknowledged she showed proof she lived in the home. However, she added one officer left and the two remaining officers parked on the two sides of her complex and remained and “stared at me for 45 minutes.” While hundreds gathered on the boulevard, a few blocks away in front of City Hall, four demonstrators stood in what they said was in support of police officers. The four said they were remaining about three blocks from the boulevard because of fears of violence from the protesters. Among the counter-protesters was Kimberlee Davis, who said her son is with the St. George Police. “We want our police department to know they have our support. We have no interest in confronting anyone,” Davis said, adding with the officer in Minneapolis facing third-degree murder charges, the protesters should have just stayed home. “There are so many good cops. This officer in Minnesota is facing charges. We’re getting justice. I would say if you want peace, go home and be at peace. They’re hurting the memory being left of George Floyd.” Back on the boulevard, 16-year-old Spencer Wilde was holding up a “Black Lives Matter” sign. The white native of Minneapolis now living in St. George said he had friends back in Minnesota who faced harassment from officers there. He said the problem are the good officers not speaking out against the bad ones. “Reach out to your community and help them. One of the biggest things are how police are trained,” said Wilde, who added the third-degree murder charge against Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin is not sending a strong enough message. “That’s the same thing as accidentally hitting someone with a car.” Saturday’s protest was described as follows by organizers on social media: This is to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter chapters around the country as we call for justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Bernard Palacio (SLC) – and all the other POC (people of color) that were unjustly killed at the hands of police. This event will discuss a ‘call to action’ about what we can do beyond this. This is not to protest or give a moment of silence only to ‘feel like you’ve done something’ and get back to your daily lives. YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE – SHOW UP AND FIND OUT HOW!! Sarah Serrano was not just protesting, she was celebrating her 19th birthday. The Latina said she was spending her birthday at the protest because she was tired of those who she said have used racial epitaphs at her and the “n-word” she said she has heard hurled at her African American friends. “There’s a reason why we say black lives matter,” Serrano said. “Of course all lives should matter, but we wouldn’t be arguing about black lives needing to matter if we didn’t need to.” Serrano’s assertion was echoed by protesters yelling, “No lives matter if black lives don’t matter.” Prentiss Miller, 25, grew up in St. George as a person of color in a town that is 88.48% white according to the most recent Census. But the Pine View High grad said seeing the predominantly Caucasian make-up of the crowd brought a smile to his face. “This is everything,” Miller said. “I’m glad there’s awareness.” Salt Lake City in curfew after violence In Northern Utah, thousands of people converged on downtown Salt Lake City on Saturday to protest, but those protests turned violent and resulted in a curfew being imposed on the city . Police officers broadcast announcements that the 8 p.m. curfew had taken effect in hopes that demonstrators would voluntarily leave the downtown area, Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. Police were prepared to give people time to leave, but they planned to arrest people who refused to comply, Brown said. “It is time to go home,” he said in a news conference after the curfew took effect. The curfew by Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall was scheduled to last until 6 a.m. Monday. Police officers from across Utah and up to 200 National Guard troops were deployed to rein in what Gov. Gary Herbert called an “escalating situation.” “We condemn violence and looting,” Herbert wrote, adding, “I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Six people had been arrested by Saturday night, Brown said. One police officer was injured after a protester struck the officer on the back of the head with a baseball bat, and two other officers have been hospitalized because of heat exhaustion, he said. What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Graffiti was also written on the state Capitol.

Gary Herbert called in the National Guard and police from multiple northern Utah law enforcement agencies were called to downtown Salt Lake City and the state Capitol after a peaceful protest turned violent Saturday afternoon. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall also declared a curfew for Salt Lake City, to last from 8 p.m. Saturday until Monday morning. Several protesters on the scene told reporters they had no intention of leaving. The protest was peaceful until shortly after 3 p.m., when protesters near the Salt Lake City Police Department crowded around a patrol car, flipped it, sprayed paint on it, bashed out the windows, and set it ablaze. As many protesters left the downtown area for the state Capitol, a few remained downtown to loot a 7-Eleven. Several stores at the City Creek mall also were looted. At the Capitol, more than two dozen Utah Highway Patrol troopers and other first responders stood peacefully around the steps, most with their hands clasped in front of them. Protesters used spray paint to vandalize the grounds, and yelled at the officers. At about 5:20 p.m., a second car was destroyed after a man apparently got out of it, then pointed a bow and arrow at the crowd. Bystanders began to beat the man, who was rescued by police in riot gear. The man later told reporters he had shouted out his car window, “All lives matter,” and was surprised it angered protesters enough that they started beating him as he tried to escape with his only available weapon, the bow and arrow. The event began quietly in the late morning, and was intended to draw attention to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, who died Monday after a police officer used his knee to force his neck into the roadway for an extended period of time. Floyd told the officer he was in pain, he begged for air, and then he said the police were going to kill him. Onlookers recorded video and begged the officer to let Floyd breathe. Floyd died shortly afterward at a hospital. The Salt Lake City protest began calmly, with people in cars chanting Floyd’s name, “Black lives matter” or “I can’t breathe.” Police stayed back, and mostly out of sight, allowing people to express their feelings. By 7:15 p.m., the protest bore no resemblance to the event that started about eight hours earlier. Protesters stood in a wall, feet from a line of officers in riot gear, shield to shield, as the minutes passed before the curfew. Armored vehicles idled nearby. At 7:33 p.m., police began to advance after a metal object, reportedly a trash can, was thrown at them. A protester jumped on an officer, and multiple other officers jumped on the young man, then picked him up and led him away, hands secured behind his back. The 8 p.m. curfew deadline came and went without the crowd clearing out. More officers arrived to support the hundreds who had arrived earlier from dozens of agencies in northern Utah. Among them were officers from Ogden, which lost a team member, Officer Nate Lyday, just two days earlier when he was fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence call. By 8:30 p.m., dusk was approaching and the standoff continued. The number of officers appeared to be increasing. At 9 p.m., night had fallen and a jail transport bus had arrived at the scene. A few minutes later, the police line pushed forward, forcing the protesters to retreat. A few struggled to hold their ground, but many began to disperse. By 9:30 p.m., the police line had advanced by a block, forcing protesters to retreat the same distance. Police used bullhorns to state the protest was illegal, and people needed to go on. With protester ranks thinning, the officers outnumbered them by about two to one. By 10:10 p.m., officers began arresting protesters who had not dispersed, and started putting them onto jail buses for transport and processing, including the filing of charges. Gephardt Daily will have more information on this story as it develops. Below, see more photos of the action. And below the photo gallery, see video shared with Gephardt Daily by Utah resident Adam Cloud, who spent about an hour Saturday afternoon walking through the crowd and capturing the mood of the protesters. 1 of 20",0.0

This caucus includes Representatives Sandra Hollins, Angela Romero, Karen Kwan, and Mark Wheatley, and Senators Luz Escamilla and Jani Iwamoto. Related: SLC Mayor announces 8 p.m. curfew after downtown protests “This pandemic has exposed injustices. We have been working for decades to fight systemic racism. We are not backing down. The unrest and anger we are witnessing in American cities – and in Utah – are symptoms of pervasive systemic racism across our country. The racist acts we have witnessed in recent weeks from cell phone videos are not necessarily new, they are recordings of a wider, chronic societal problem. People are worn down. This pandemic has people physically and economically exhausted. They are outraged by the lingering injustice of another African-American man needlessly killed by police. We understand that people want to be heard. As legislators, we encourage people who choose to protest to stay safe, respect property, and respect social distancing. We will continue pressing for reforms to our criminal justice system, de-escalation training for law enforcement, and more accountability and transparency from law enforcement and government officials. We are also working hard to address the continuing inequities experienced by communities of color during this pandemic. Now is a time for civility, kindness, and empathy. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ‘Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.’”",0.0

Utahns took to the streets of Ogden and Salt Lake City to voice their frustrations and express their calls for justice after Floyd’s murder. RELATED: Governor deploys National Guard to help control ‘escalating situation’ in downtown Salt Lake City ABC4’s Brittany Johnson spoke with Corey Hodges, Lead Pastor of The Point Church, on Saturday to get his reaction. Thoughts on George Floyd “The situation and the video that we watched here in America and probably around the world is very heartbreaking. It speaks of nothing but a murder. We actually watched someone murdered on that tape. And someone, I might add, that didn’t seem to be resisting and that was under the control of a police officer. Watching that was heartbreaking. It broke my heart.” How the George Floyd incident makes him reflect on his children “It really makes me uncomfortable. I have three African-American boys and I think about it every day.” “I literally haven’t stopped thinking about their safety and making sure they’re not stopped by a police officer, and if they were, if they are, that they comply with orders and demands, and that they will make it safe. This is the unfortunate reality of being Black in America, as it relates to our interactions.” How the Pastor discusses the tough imagery with his children and his multicultural church “There’s a famous quote by Dr. King that says, ‘In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.’ I think those are very powerful words because we have to all speak up any time we see injustice or humanity being mistreated or degraded.” “We all have different platforms and and different levels of exposure, but we can all do our small part. For instance, are we intentional about developing and nurturing relationships with people who are not like us, who come from a different ethnic group or a different economic bracket or different educational bracket. I think a lot of times we are victims of being too narrow in our exposure and in our friendship circles. One of the things I tell my people at our church as the pastor is that we have to do that. We have to be intentional about creating friendship circles that are diverse. Whether it is personal spaces, our work spaces, our worship spaces, we have to be intentional about making sure that we can create safe spaces and safe places for people that are different than ourselves, to have honest and frank conversations so we can learn from each other. Learn what our commonalities are and learn what our differences are and learn how to put those things together for the common good of humanity.” Thoughts on escalating protests in Salt Lake City “I’m so disappointed because I don’t think you can get peace from violence. I don’t think you fight fire with fire. To protest peacefully is one of our amendment rights. I think people have a right to exercise the right to protest and to peacefully protest. But the violence and the destruction of property is — I don’t condone that. I don’t think that’s the way forward. We have to learn how to channel channel our frustrations or anger, pain, in more positive ways in order to make a difference.” Other ways people can instill change other than protest “We have to get involved in the process, in the political process. People who have color have to find themselves in positions of power, meaning, run for elected office, go to law school to be a judge, or when you’re called for jury duty, make sure you show up to express that privilege as a citizen so our voices can be heard and balance out the voices so they’re not so monolithic in as they are in a lot of places in our society.” People have protested peacefully but no one listened, and now they’re fed up “I certainly can relate to that feeling. I feel that way. I am fed up, I am hurt, I am angry, I am disappointed that some times It feels like the contract we have with America is not being fulfilled on both ends. I don’t want to in any way diminish or delegitimize those real and legitimate feelings. I want to say that first. However, we have to channel those emotions in more positive ways. We have to continue to do it and let those frustrations be the fuel for our power, of activism, and peaceful protest. And as a person of faith, we have to pray. Ultimately, those who are faithful people and people of prayer, we know that prayer works. And those people that may not be people of faith, but are people of goodwill, we have to be steadfast in our desire for change, no matter how frustrated and setup we get. But being violent and expressing our frustrations in a destructive way — I don’t think in my personal opinion, is part of the solution. It may get attention and it may make you feel better for a second or two, but in the end, it’s going to be our civic responsibilities as law-abiding citizens that will further the cause of equality and equal rights for everybody.” People across the United States are empathetic to the George Floyd incident “I think the word is empathy. I think people, anybody, any human being, who is good hearted and of goodwill, when they are exposed in this age of social media, when they are exposed to the inhumane, unjustified, deplorable, despicable, disgusting murder of a Black man, and for that matter for any man, but in this case, a Black man, all too often, when they see that, no matter where you are, it is inflammatory. It is inexcusable. It elicits emotions that are sometimes uncontrollable. I don’t think you have to be in the town where that happens. You don’t have to be in Minneapolis. You just have to be a human being of goodwill, and of good conscience and a good morality to be upset. I think the whole nation, regardless of our locations, as relates to states, the nation is responding to what they’ve seen through this video.” Thoughts on President Donald Trump tweets saying, “when they loot it’s time to shoot.” “I think crises will illuminate anyone who is in leadership. It will illuminate their ability or their inability. When you are a leader, you have a responsibility to lead with wisdom. I feel like you are responsible to the people that you’re leading to express words of peace and words of calm. Leaders should not be advocating further division for the violence of anything. Leadership in times of crisis requires empathy, it requires wisdom, it requires leaders to think before they speak. That’s one piece of it. On the other hand, those who are protesting have to also use the same sort of wisdom. It’s okay to be frustrated, it’s legitimate to be angry, it’s legitimate emotion to be fed up, you know. These are all legitimate emotions. I’m just saying that when you protest, you have to make sure that you post this in a way where you can be heard. After tonight, after the fires have gone out, I think while the violent protests may get the attention for a second, for a minute, that’s not sufficient. We’re looking for long term solutions. In order to get long term solutions, you have to think strategically, ‘how is this going to impact my cause, my passion, the things I’m frustrated about in the long term?’ And I just don’t believe that violence accomplishes long term solutions.”",0.0

Unlike the demonstration against racism and police use of deadly force that turned violent in downtown Salt Lake City, however, the one in Stansbury Park against coronavirus restrictions that led to the cancellation of a country western concert remained peaceful. Eric Moutsos, the event organizer, shared news with the crowd of a flipped vehicle and rioting in Utah’s capital. “But we’re the radical group, right?” he asked the orderly crowd sarcastically. “This is how true patriots do it in America; what we’re doing right here.” About 1,000 people showed up at the historic Benson Grist Mill in Stansbury Park, even with only an hour’s notice of the venue change. The protest stemmed from a concert arranged by Utah Business Revival, featuring country star Collin Raye. The event was initially supposed to be held at a Kaysville park with Mayor Katie Witt’s backing. The City Council revolted, passed a resolution renouncing the mayor and threatened to turn on sprinklers to stop the gathering. Concert organizers moved the event to the Amphitheater at Studio Ranch near Grantsville — in defiance of the Tooele County Health Department’s restrictions on gatherings. Utah Business Revival argued in court that the gathering was no more dangerous than shopping at a big-box store, but a 3rd District judge disagreed. On Friday, she issued a preliminary order to block the concert. Utah Business Revival still plans to hold a Raye performance in two weeks at an unknown location, according to its website. Witt, who originally pushed for the concert in her Davis County city and is running for Congress, told the audience Saturday to “stand for freedom right now. ... Now is when it counts.” With concert plans postponed, protesters who gathered at Benson Grist Mill bought products from about a dozen businesses that sent up tents in the park, played cornhole, tossed Frisbees, picnicked and listened to prerecorded country music played over loudspeakers. “We’re just celebrating our freedoms. We have to make money somehow,” said American Fork resident Loren Lybbert, who was selling T-shirts at the event with his two daughters.

It means even the governor has to obey the law.” Herbert has issued a series of executive orders adjusting the rules and the state’s risk level in response to the pandemic. Many touch on business operations and social distancing guidelines. Most of Utah is currently in a “yellow,” or low-risk, phase with most businesses reopened. Even so, the public is still encouraged to maintain social distancing and wear facing coverings when such spacing is difficult to do. “I’m not going back to some ‘new normal,’” Lyman said, “where we don’t meet, where we don’t gather, where we give up our constitutional rights.” Utah County Clerk/Auditor Amelia Powers Gardner told protesters that the best way to make the government serve residents is to make the government “obsolete.”",0.0

Hundreds of police officers — with sirens and lights flashing — could be seen racing to the downtown area. The governor activated the National Guard, one of 14 governors across the nation to do so Saturday, and the mayor ordered a curfew to start at 8 p.m. that will last through early Monday morning. And just before 9 p.m., police began their march to restore order in Salt Lake City, closing a nearly 11-hour day of protest, violence and restraint in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s curfew edict is in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place, including for the purpose of travel, with the following exceptions: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, News media People traveling to work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling to the airport; patronizing private businesses; seeking medical care; fleeing dangerous circumstances; or experiencing homelessness. Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in a public place for reasons other than these. “The safe space we offered for today’s protest ... is no longer safe for anybody,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said as she invoked an 8 p.m. curfew that will extend until 6 a.m. Monday. Dozens were arrested, and several officers injured as well as some demonstrators. But the Beehive State did not see the level of violence experienced in other cities across the U.S. Clearing the city Police, who were joined by officers from multiple agencies across the Wasatch Front, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, in two lines that stretched the length of the street and beyond, attempting to push back the crowd that had swelled throughout the day. As night approached, a military helicopter circled overhead, but officers largely stayed in formation downtown and at the state Capitol as protesters continued talking, yelling and chanting. Discarded posters blew across the Capitol lawn, while a lone couple collected discarded water bottles that were left or thrown by protesters. “We are pleading with you to clear the city,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said. “We’re not going anywhere. We intend to be on the street. We will enforce the laws.” Police did not aggressively enforce curfew right at 8 p.m., and few protesters had left on their own. By about 8:40 p.m., officers began advancing demonstrators toward City Hall. Some taunted and hurled expletives at officers, while others retreated onto the lawn. By 9 p.m. at the Capitol, an order to disperse was played over a loudspeaker. The crowd began yelling obscenities and some were flipping off the deputies standing in front of them. Others began to leave the way they were told, but about a dozen people sat down on the plaza, showcasing their intent to stay. “It is time to go home,” Brown said. “This is not helping. ... Nothing good can come of this now. This is not helpful. This does not promote the dialogue and conversation we need to have.” Officers in riot gear were seen being treated for what appeared to be minor injuries, mostly heat exhaustion, Brown said. They’d been hit with projectiles and pushed and one was attacked by a protester with a baseball bat. “Had it not been for his helmet, he could have been seriously injured or killed,” the chief said. Dozens were arrested downtown as hundreds of police officers advanced south from 400 South to around 700 South. Officers led many with hands zip-tied into jail transport buses. At least two were arrested at the Capitol after refusing to leave the premises. An attempt to restore peace Mendenhall, who surveyed the area from an Air National Guard helicopter overhead, said no one would be allowed on public streets except law enforcement, news media, medical personnel, and anyone transporting food, traveling to somewhere, patronizing businesses, fleeing danger or experiencing homelessness. “What is happening here does nothing to right past wrongs or rebuild a system that is unjust,” she said. “If you are on Salt Lake City streets right now ... go home. “Stop destroying our city.” Gov. Gary Herbert added, “Make no mistake, we’ll do whatever is necessary to restore order to our capital city, to Salt Lake.” Recently retired Pastor France A. Davis, of the Calvary Baptist Church on State Street, said, “We are all part of this community. There’s no use anybody destroying any of it.” He pleaded with people to protest more effectively. “It’s OK to be frustrated,” Rev. Davis said. “Do all you can, but do it nonviolently.” At one point, a man showed up with a bow and arrow and allegedly aimed it at protesters just before he was attacked by a group of people. That man, who is known to police, was taken away injured and bloodied from the scene as protesters then flipped and looted his car and set it on fire. Explosions could be heard from blocks away and dark smoke billowed into the air. The man later returned and got into a verbal argument with protesters. “I came down here originally to help the cops,” the man said. “But, all I did was yell out, ‘All lives matter’ and I got beat up by black people.” It was a scene similar to the final night of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City when officers in riot gear used similar tactics — with shields and rubber bullets — to push a large crowd that refused to disperse out of the city. Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera and many of her officers and deputies were on scene to assist and they brought a bus and other vehicles to transport arrested protesters to the Salt Lake County Jail. “We just need peace. Too many people are getting hurt. I’m willing to come to the table with whoever wants to come and talk to me about the issues. Especially with what’s going on nationwide,” she said. “I get it. I’m a person of color as well and I get it. I’m happy to listen. I’m happy to make changes. But this is not how we do that,” Rivera said. She said the Unified Police Department has been doing all it can to make sure its officers are as diverse as our communities. “And it helps. But we need to communicate and listen, not just communicate. We have to learn to listen and be willing to make those changes and I’m happy to do so,” she said. Unsafe conditions Father Paul Truebenbach, of St. Peter and Paul Orthodox Christian Church in Salt Lake City, was at the protest to protect the church near the 7-Eleven that was looted at 400 South and 300 East. He said he asked officers if he should hold church services Sunday, to mixed reaction from police. “This idea of social justice is so dangerous because it seeks to change everything around you. In orthodox, it is the opposite, it seeks to change us. You can’t change what you don’t have,” Father Truebenbach said. He said about a half-dozen people will be guarding the church through the night and no decision had been made about services. Jacenta Morris, 36, a black woman from Salt Lake City, said she came to protest with her family, to be a part of history she hopes will result in change. But the violence that ensued disturbed her. “I think this is too much. I think they should calm down and do it a different way than rioting,” she said. “I worry about my sons, I have two boys,” Morris said. “Anything could happen to them, they could be walking down the street and anything could happen.” Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, pleaded with people to stop the violence. “We understand the frustration and anger of those protesting,” she said, adding that the protest started out OK, but “the conversation changed.” “Nobody will remember why we were here,” Hollins said. The original message opposing systematic racism, she said, will be overshadowed by violence. “The solution is not burning down a city.” Grid View A police vehicle drives near a burning car as people protest police brutality in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020.

Allred, Deseret News Disordered destruction At least two police vehicles were destroyed or suffered heavy damage. In addition to an unoccupied Salt Lake patrol car being overturned and burned, another unmarked police vehicle had its windows smashed out. Other vehicles parked nearby were vandalized as well, including a news media vehicle, which bore the painted words: “Stop protecting them.” After a couple of hours of letting protesters get their frustrations out, police in riot gear and armored vehicles started to form a perimeter around the library and systematically move people out of the area. TRAX service in the downtown area was halted about 5 p.m. and travelers were encouraged to avoid the area. Protesters knelt in front of a line of officers wearing riot gear outside the Salt Lake Main Library just after 5 p.m. Behind them was a burnt out and vandalized police car that hours earlier, protesters had pushed on its top, beat out the windows and started on fire.

Looting was reported at a 7-Eleven near the library, although there was also a video of protesters intervening and pleading with others not to steal or destroy property. Jay Barton said he was inspired by a former military man who yelled at the protesters, telling them their actions were hurting their cause. Barton said the unidentified man was telling him he felt inspired to come downtown Saturday when suddenly a group of protesters ran toward the convenience store, broke windows and started stealing beer and other items. “This man immediately walked up front and started yelling at the people who shattered the glass. His words where inspiring. Truly a beautiful moment.” “This isn’t the answer. This is what they want. They want us against each other,” the man yelled. “You need to be against every single person who’s turned this into a criminal activity. … This isn’t right.” Police were also seen responding to reports of vandalism at City Creek Center mall. It was not immediately clear whether anything was stolen. Large rocks and fireworks were thrown at police in riot gear as protesters chanted phrases such as “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can’t breathe.” A woman also attempted to attack several protesters with a hammer, hitting another woman who declined medical assistance, Salt Lake Police Sgt. Keith Horrocks said. Protesters wrestled the hammer from the woman, Horrocks said, and she ran off before police could find her. Fighting for change Katie Allen Yazzie, a 17-year-old Navajo girl, attended the rally with a sign that said, “My skin is not a weapon.” “Me being a person of color does not mean that the police should be scared of me or of anyone who has the color of my skin or darker. It’s to the point that I’m scared of police in general. I don’t want them around me because they’re not good to me,” she said. Her mother, Christine Allen, attended on Saturday with her. She said officers have helped her in the past and she respects them, but believes all people aren’t treated equally. “I think that a society is only as good as the people who are the most vulnerable are treated,” she said. “We have to stand up for each other because people of color don’t’ have a police force they can rely on. They have to rely on the community. They have to rely on each other.” Ishjon Hawkins, 30, of New Orleans, said he joined the protest because of the way he feels police have treated him in the past. “Me being a black man, growing up, I had a lot of run-ins with the police and they’re aggressive. They abuse their authority,” he said. “We want change. We need different laws.” Asked if he has issues with police in general or just some officers, Hawkins said, “Honestly, it’s white police. It’s just like they’ve got it out for us. … I don’t get it.” Marvin Oliveros was at the protest and encouraged people to continue protesting. Belgard’s step-brother, Cody Paris Belgard, 30, was shot and killed by five Salt Lake police officers in December 2018. The shooting was later determined to be justified by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Oliveros said he understands better than anyone what Floyd’s family is going through. “I know the pain they’re going through. I know the answers they’re searching for,” he said, encouraging protesters to “keep up the pressure” so all victims of police brutality are remembered. “While we were devastated to hear what happened to George Floyd — and make no mistake: we condemn what happened on all counts — we were saddened today to see the violence and riots here in Salt Lake City,” Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Lexi Cunningham said. She said police were using East High School as a staging area to respond to the protests, which erupted in pockets all over the city after dark. “We urge all community members to continue the fight to end systemic racism, to look for peaceful ways to improve communities daily, and here in Salt Lake City, we urge you to please be safe and follow the curfew established by Mayor Mendenhall,” Cunningham said.

Spenser Heaps, Deseret News Standing their ground The exterior of the state Capitol was vandalized, as was the stone retaining wall near the street. At one point, two people with cans of spray paint wrote obscenities on the walkway and granite pillars, but just as a trooper moved to shoo them away, another waved him back to the line of officers on the last set of steps leading into the Capitol’s front doors. The officers, most of whom stood stone-faced as protesters yelled questions or obscenities at them, were from several agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Office and the Utah Highway Patrol. Some officers engaged in conversations with protesters, including discussions of race, history and philosophy. Among those talking with officers was Rae Duckworth, who lost her cousin Bobby Duckworth in September 2019 to an officer-involved shooting in Wellington, Carbon County. She said she was there with Black Lives Matter and Utahns Against Police Brutality. “We’re just here peacefully protesting ... and I just really want to have conversations,” the 28-year-old Salt Lake County woman said. “I really think transparency and communication are two big issues. We don’t know what law enforcement does. We know they police themselves, and that doesn’t do anything good or valuable for the community.” She said several officers engaged in conversations, and she felt most of them were productive. She pointed out that at least one said he’d meet with local Black Lives Matter leaders to discuss what kinds of change would restore trust and confidence in policing for those who feel unfairly targeted. “They even have their opinions about George Floyd, that they’re brave enough to speak up about,” she said. “And they’ve also told me that they actually speak up against racism in their own departments, which is a step that needs to be taken.” One officer said he was married to a person of color, and he told her he thought it would be helpful to him as he raises four mixed-race children. “I think one of them actually felt this movement,” Duckworth said. “Versus the other ones who stand there like brick walls or statues.” Some people were passing by and decided to join the line of officers standing on the bottom stair of the Capitol steps, including one man who said, “I’m here to protect the people’s house.” One black man engaged in an hourlong conversation about institutional racism with a number of those standing with police, including a firefighter and a Native American teenager. The small conversation expanded as a Hispanic man passing by added his thoughts, and the group jumped from slavery to genocide to the lack of educational opportunities and whether the protests accomplished anything important. As he rode away on a scooter about 7 p.m., a police officer yelled to him, “Awesome.” Clouds moved in and some rain fell, but the crowd thinned and then swelled throughout the afternoon and evening. At one point, protesters threw water bottles, rocks and other items at police. Earlier in the afternoon, while the protest was calm, people spoke about why they were there. “As a country, I just feel broken, and I feel scared for everyone in the black community. I just feel that our country is just not letting us live our lives, and innocent people are being killed for no reason,” Savanah Norman said, becoming emotional in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building.

Laura Seitz, Deseret News Related Deseret News reporter and his wife explore the perils of being black in America “I do feel a lot of support today here. Seeing a lot of people come out is very liberating and exciting to see, because I think, here in Utah, there is still a lot of racism. And so I’m really happy that people came out to show support,” Norman said. “I just think we’re at our last straw,” she said. “This is it. People are fed up, and they have every right to be. And I think this murder of George Floyd, everyone is just done. We’re done.” A show of solidarity Early on, the protest remained relatively uneventful, with even some children out with their parents to call for justice for Floyd. The protest had originally been planned as a vehicle caravan, with participants discouraged from rallying outside of their cars. Organizers asked for the protesters to maintain physical distance from others. Thousands of people in vehicles circled the Salt Lake City Police Department, many waving signs from their windows that said slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd,” with others decrying racism and calling for police reform. “I feel like I know what my ancestors went through in the 1960s, and it’s sad that here in 2020, we’re still saying, ‘I can’t believe this. We’re saying, ‘black lives matter.’ This isn’t the first time a black man has been killed like this,” Zala Long told the Deseret News. “It’s good because I feel like we’re showing the world, and we’re showing the SLCPD that we see them and we’re watching them, and we’re letting our voices be heard. I feel a lot of empathy, I feel a lot of sadness, but also I’m glad that we’re saying their names. We’re saying George Floyd, we’re saying ... Ahmed Arbery. We’re not going to forget about them. We care about them, because if we don’t, then no one else will,” she promised. She said she feels the Floyd case is getting more attention than others. “But I feel like we’ve been at the tipping point for years. we’re tired of fighting for our rights, but we’re going to fight for our rights,” she said, explaining that she believes the police force needs to be restructured to root out systemic racism. “The question isn’t who’s next, it’s when is he next. When am I next, when is she next, when are my brothers next, when is my mom next, when is my dad next?” Naia James added. Within an hour, cars packed the streets, creating a standstill in traffic downtown, and thousands also marched on foot chanting “We can’t breathe,” making their way up to the state Capitol. Beth Jennings and her family lived in Minneapolis before moving to Utah, and says she has friends there who are being impacted by the turmoil. “We just wanted to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis right now against police violence,” Jennings said. Haizel Jennings, 10, said of Floyd’s death: “I feel like it’s sort of unhumanizing of that cop because I feel like it’s sort of human right to try, if at some point you could stop someone dying, to stop it. It’s part of human rights, I think.” “I would hope all of us will stand tall for the issues of civil rights,” Herbert said. “What we see today is not typical Utah behavior. We’re better than that here in Utah.” Contributing: Annie Knox, Alex Cabrero",0.0

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

Even as they halted traffic on the Capital Beltway and shouted obscenities at the fleet of presidential helicopters that carried Trump back to the White House, the demonstrations scattered throughout the city remained mostly peaceful. But there were also signs of increased tension as the protesters sought to call attention to the killing of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. Some threw bottles at Secret Service agents and police near the White House. Officers respondedby firing tear gasto break up the crowds. The D.C. National Guard joined other armored forces in Lafayette Square, near the White House, in trying to control protesters. “Don’t run! Don’t run!” some yelled as police and protesters clashed outside the park Saturday night. Showing at least five red welts on her bare left arm, Lindsay Kouyate, 21, said she was shot with something she couldn't identify. Kouyate said she was holding her ""I Cant Breathe"" sign near the police in front of Lafayette Square at the time. ""I was just standing there with my sign. A bunch of other people were yelling and screaming,” she said. ""He shot me so many times. I don’t know what it was."" Kouyate, who lives in Maryland, said she had been at the protests all day but wasn’t going home, even after her injury. More:Joe Biden on George Floyd protests: 'We must not allow this pain to destroy us' ""You have to keep protesting,"" she said, ""otherwise it won’t ever stop."" Nour Faladi, a 22-year-old programmer from Maryland, was among those caught in a round of tear gas. She was in a crowd when a gas canister hit the ground, she said, and it was “immediately harder to breathe."" She said her eyes started running. She said a volunteer in the crowd washed her eyes out, and then she headed back into the crowd. Police wearing helmets and holding shields formed a line between the protesters and the White House, a hot spot in the city throughout much of Saturday evening. At times, some protesters tried to knock over temporary barriers or approach officers, although none appeared to get near the tall fence at the White House. At least one vehicle was on fire a few blocks north of the White House, and firefighters also responded to an alley fire near the White House. A local TV station reported that stores in the city's tony Georgetown neighborhood had boarded windows. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida earlier Saturday and returned to the White House on Marine One at around 8:30 p.m.As the presidential helicopters buzzed overhear near the White House grounds, some demonstrators shouted obscenities and shook their fists. Trump used his address at the Kennedy Space Center to offer a stern warning to ""rioters, looters and anarchists"" against violence. ""My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold,"" Trump said, blaming violence in several cities on ""radical left-wing"" groups. ""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate...It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of democracy: The rule of law."" The unrest in Washington came as protests erupted in cities across the nation against police brutality and racial discrimination. At least two deaths have been linked to the demonstrations. Protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with police officers dressed in riot gear in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Portland, Oregon; and elsewhere. Attorney General Barr:Peaceful protests over George Floyd 'hijacked' by 'far left extremist groups' Outside the White House, officers wearing plastic body shields charged and pushed back a crowd of people who had removed metal barriers set up on Pennsylvania Avenue. A police helicopter circled overhead. The smell of marijuana also hung in the air. ""Trump is the reason why cops feel they can do certain things to black people,” said Cameron Jackson, 25, a supervisor at a grocery store, as he stood in the middle of 16th Street. “He condones it. He is a racist.” But Jackson said heopposed violence. ""I'm peaceful,"" he said. ""I'm away from the violence."" Dave Pringle, 32, who works on criminal justice policy in D.C., also condemned Trump. ""This man – this occupant of this building – represents the worst of humanity,"" Pringle said. ""I think he is an avatar of the worst of humanity."" Six people were arrested near Lafayette Square on Friday and early Saturday, according to the Secret Service, which said it ""respects the right to assemble, and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all."" Secret Service agents and police carrying shields blocked off Lafayette Square north of the White House as drivers honked in support of the protesters and raised their fists in the air. Some demonstrators held up signs that read: ""Stop Murdering Black People"" and ""White Silence is Violence."" ""I came here to enforce the Black Lives Matter movement and to get justice for the injustices we have been receiving for over hundreds of years,"" said Ariel Weems, a 16-year-old high school student from Bowie, Maryland. She called Trump part of the problem. “I don’t agree with any of his policies,"" Weems said. ""His Twitter comments? Shooting and looting? That was absurd. ... We’re out here protesting for our lives.” In the heat of the afternoon, some moved through the crowds, passing out water bottles. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, others distributed masks. Most of the demonstrators wore masks but were closer than six feet from each other. Strumming a guitar, Steve Canciani, 28, sang the Christian song “Break Every Chain” with Daniel Faludi, 22, near the White House. Their music mixed with the sound of sirens and the whirring of a circling helicopter. ""God always has a solution,"" Canciani said. Jake Schindler, 26, was one of several people handing out water. Schindler said his Christian faith ""called him"" to justice. After running by the protest earlier in the afternoon and seeing others giving out water, he came back with a case of bottles to distribute. James Bryant, a 30-year-old Washington resident, said he felt “like he needed to show up as a black man in America.” The protests, he said, were part of a “collective anger” that Americans can't ignore. Asked if he was worried about tensions between the crowd and the cordon of police, he shrugged and said, “they’re just people.” By early evening, some protesters marched to the National Museum of African American History and Culture near the Washington Monument. Along the route, someone painteda Wells Fargo bank branch with the words ""capitalism is murder."" Others paintedreferences to the police and to Floyd on the ground. Bowser and Trump:DC Mayor Bowser responds to Trump's criticism over police after George Floyd protests Corey Gwynn, a 27-year-old speech pathologist from Virginia, told USA TODAY she had joined the protest because she was ""upset about the lack of equality,"" especially as people had peacefully protested for so long ""with no change."" Asked what she thought of the protests around the country, some of which turned violent, she said she ""can’t blame her brothers and sisters, but that’s not the way I’m going about it."" ""Merchandise can be replaced, but black lives can’t, she said. Floyd, 46, died Monday evening, shortly after video footage showed him handcuffed, gasping for air and saying ""I can't breathe,"" as a white officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The video, taken by a bystander, circulated online and prompted widespread protests nationwide. Who was George Floyd? George Floyd remembered as 'gentle giant' as family calls his death 'murder' George Floyd death'Why can't I just be black in the state of Minnesota?' The Minneapolis Police Department fired four officers involved in the incident while state and federal authorities have launched investigations into the matter. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck, was arrested Friday and is facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said. But those actions have done little to quell the anger many feel. Sherese Teixeira, 33, posed for a photo in front of graffiti sprayed on the side of a building near the White House that read: “Why do we keep having to tell you that black lives matter?” ""It’s been going on too long,” Teixeira said. ""We're just tired of it."" Contributing: Kristine Phillips, Bart Jansen, Matthew Brown, John Fritze, Courtney Subramanian",0.0

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march.

Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that.""

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds.

Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said.

Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C.

When police horses entered the area, a chaotic few seconds followed: Police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Glass bottles flew through the air. At one point the crowd chanted: ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. That demonstration had apparently ended without arrests, and the police had largely let it play out on its own, without interference. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. — Laura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Detroit: Day starts peacefully, turns violent Saturday, in the light of day, the protesting crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, with police following marching protesters closely and even handing out masks, a coronavirus precaution, to those who did not have them.

In the skirmishes, Detroit Free Press reporters were exposed to tear gas, and a phone was violently knocked out of a photographer's hand. Police in riot gear, supported by armored cars, moved toward protesters. Crowds began to gather at about 4:30 p.m. Most wore masks, and many carried signs, some with angry slogans.

But she also acknowledged the bigger issue of police accountability here and nationally and the reason behind the initial peaceful protests Saturday afternoon — to highlight police brutality in such incidences as the death last week of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Mendenhall noted before the riots started, talks were already underway with members of the community on how to make the police department more transparent. “We are united in our work, and we acknowledge we can always do better as a city and as a police department,” Mendenhall said. Just hours after violent protests around the Salt Lake Main Library ended, the mayor and Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown assessed the events at an 8 a.m. news conference. Twenty-one officers were treated for medical issues from Saturday’s protests, Brown said, the most common heat exhaustion. One officer was hit in the back of his head with a baseball bat. If not for the helmet he was wearing, Brown said, that officer could have suffered critical injuries or even been killed. Police arrested 46 people, most of them for failing to disperse. Some were arrested for assaulting police officers and others for curfew violations. The chief said he suspected that many of those arrested are not from the area. “I honestly believe there were people from out of state who were here to instigate violence,” Brown said. The arrested The Deseret News reviewed 40 police affidavits of those booked into either the Salt Lake County or Davis County jails after being arrested during the protests. Nearly every person arrested was for failing to disperse. Others had additional arrest charges for disorderly conduct, violating curfew and drug possession. Among those arrested for investigation of failure to disperse are: Adam Arkeem Demond Ervin, 24; Gabriella Megan Gourdin, 24; Marcos Jose Castillo, 21; Aimee Kim Nguyen, 24; Morgan K. Facemyer, 18; Erin Leigh Berdahl, 19; Vanessa Robyn Jeppesen, 22; Mercedes McKinley, 31; Leonardo Raul Gaytan Morales, 21; Annika Dowsakul Bouttavong, 22; Evangelina Gonzalez, 22; Hannah Lillie Wilson, 21; Odette Baumeister, 18; Jordan Kevin Turner, 29; Melissa Renae Brainerd, 27; Bradley David Hagen, 40; Rebecca Rodriguez, 28; Jarod Donovan Hartlerode, 30; Kiesh Easterwood, 25; Justin Dean Kramer, 36; Riley Westergard, 21; Ian Eaton, 20; Scott Mark Larson, 33; Hobie Jeffery Simon, 39; Lance Chadrick Delano Kaufusi, 18; Jacob Daniel Corbaley, 24; Stephen Henry Sprague, 26; Patrick Edward Mac, 36; Thien Nhut Vu, 38; Nacom Abdoul Koffi, 49; Carlos Daniel Vastellanos, 18; James G. Hawthorne 70; Perry Bryant Bates, 33; Adam Gethin Fuller, 24; and Robert Adam Hubbert, 24. In addition to failing to disperse, Zachary Julius, 24, was also arrested for investigation of drug possession. Ashley Anne Sims, 30, was arrested at the state Capitol for investigation of failing to disperse and assaulting an officer. Utah Highway Patrol troopers gave the crowd gathered on the Capitol grounds 90 minutes to disperse, according to a police affidavit. “Some of the protesters remained at the scene, well after the warning had been issued. Ashley Anne Sims was one that failed to disperse. In the process of arrest, Sims kicked a sergeant with Utah Highway Patrol, in the groin,” the affidavit states. Sims also was in possession of a can of spray paint at the time of her arrest, police say. Emilie Marie Smith, 22, and Lauren Elizabeth Hambrick, 24, were arrested for investigation of criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for allegedly throwing rocks through the window of the Matheson Courthouse, 450 S. State. “The result of (their) actions caused the window to break causing a spider web effect,” according to a police affidavit. “The cost to replace the window is estimated at approximately $10,000.” Shane Brooks, 30, was arrested for investigation of failing to disperse, violating curfew and disorderly conduct. Brooks was in the area of 400 South and 200 East and “failed to disperse at the command of police while actively protesting and rioting,” according to a police affidavit. Information about the other six who were arrested was not available. Those arrested for investigation of failing to disperse ranged in age from 18 to 70, with most in their mid-20s. Those arrested live in cities such as Salt Lake City, Sandy, West Valley City, West Jordan and Layton, according to court records. While most of those arrested have minor criminal histories in Utah, court records state, some people have no prior criminal history or even a traffic ticket in Utah. It was not immediately known Sunday whether those people live in the state. Salt Lake police said some people were booked into the Davis County Jail to avoid overcrowding at the Salt Lake County Jail, which also helped in addressing COVID-19 concerns. At least two police vehicles were damaged during the protest, including a Salt Lake police patrol car that was flipped over and destroyed by fire. Sunday afternoon, police were asking for the public’s help to identify three men that detectives wanted to question who were captured in photos and video. “We would like to speak with them regarding the flipping, vandalism, and burning of a Salt Lake City Police car. If you know who they are, please call 801-799-3000,” police tweeted. Man with a weapon Both Brown and Mendenhall were also asked about a confrontation between a man with a bow and arrow and protesters on Saturday. According to witnesses, a man armed with a bow and arrow, and also possibly a knife, drove his SUV up to demonstrators and threatened them. Protesters immediately attacked the man, leaving him with a bloody face, and then flipped his vehicle over once he was out, and set it on fire. The man was seen being led away by police in handcuffs, but later reappeared after being released, and got into another verbal confrontation with protesters. Brown called the incident a “troubling” situation and a “priority investigation.” Although the man was not booked into jail, police say they know his name and charges will be screened against him. Mendenhall asked Sunday for anyone who witnessed the confrontation involving the bow and arrow to contact police. The Deseret News has confirmed the identity of the man whose car was burned as a 62-year-old Taylorsville resident. The same man was charged with assault in Taylorsville Justice Court on May 7 in a suspected road rage incident, according to police. In that case, the man was angry that another vehicle pulling a trailer near 6200 South and 4000 West was allegedly driving too slow, said Unified Police Sgt. Melody Gray. The man claimed he was then cut off, which somehow resulted in a fist fight between the two drivers, she said. The man left the scene before police arrived but was found at his home a short time later and cited. The Taylorsville man also has a criminal history in California, according to public records. Still figuring the toll Numerous glass panes were broken at TRAX platforms, and many buildings — including the state Capitol and the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building — were tagged with graffiti. Mendenhall said city officials were still counting how many buildings were damaged Sunday. But she noted that windows can be replaced. “We will clean up. We will repair,” she said. And while the mayor is grateful for the spirit of volunteerism she is seeing as people have asked to come downtown Sunday to help with cleanup efforts, Mendenhall wants everyone to obey the curfew that runs until 6 a.m. Monday. “The trash and spray paint are not going anywhere,” she said. At the Capitol, a few dozen volunteers had been working to scrub off graffiti since 8 a.m., said Allyson Gamble, Capitol Preservation Board executive director. Most of the vandalism involved graffiti, paint and litter around the grounds, she said, expressing gratitude that more serious damage wasn’t done. Open for review The mayor has asked Brown to give her a “thorough after-action review” of how officers handled Saturday’s riot, and she asked any citizen who felt they weren’t treated well by police to file a complaint so the Citizen Review Board could look at any inappropriate use of force. “We welcome the criticism and critique in a positive fashion,” Brown said, adding that he would like to have critical and positive conversations with the public. Brown specifically addressed an incident caught on video of a Salt Lake police officer dressed in riot gear shoving an elderly man with a cane to the ground as the man slowly tried to move away from the scene. A couple of other officers quickly went to the man to help him back to his feet. “I have seen the video and it was inappropriate,” the chief said. “This is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD. My expectations are that if people are exercising their First Amendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully.” Brown said “it was hard for me to watched what happened” and he has since reached out to the man and personally apologized. The officer who shoved the elderly man has been identified, but his name was not released. The chief said an internal investigation is underway. While it was unclear Sunday whether that officer is on administrative leave or just reassigned, police confirmed he had been taken off crowd control duty. Mendenhall later commended the chief in a tweet for taking action. “While @slcpd yesterday largely showed great restraint and patience, I am grateful to Chief Brown for responding swiftly to address the incident with the older gentleman with a cane.” Advocacy groups speak out Jacarri Kelley, leader of Northern Utah Black Lives Matter, said Sunday she was disappointed in the direction the protest took. “I should be comfortable enough to take my child to a legal protest, but when people are angry or hurt or don’t have a way to vent their frustrations, that’s when they do what they did yesterday. I don’t condone rioting or looting. I understand people are hurt, but here in Utah, that’s not the answer. We have so many other ways people can help us out,” Kelley said. Kelley doesn’t know how the demonstration got out of hand, but believes other groups, including white nationalists and supremacists, joined in potentially to take the spotlight off the intended message of the planned protest. She said instead of rioting, it’s more helpful for those who want to help the cause by volunteering with groups like Black Lives Matter and Utah Against Police Brutality. “I want to see all those young people out there letting their voices be heard with their right to vote. A lot of people don’t have that right, but because they do because they’re fresh and young, they should exercise their right to vote for those who can’t,” Kelley said. Utahns against Police Brutality also issued a statement. “This is what happens when elected officials, police departments, and ‘leaders’ ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S. This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence,” it said in part. “This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence. “Mayor Mendenhall said that the events around the May 30 protest aren’t what justice looks like. We agree. This is what a demand looks like, a demand that can’t be ignored any longer. Justice would have been enacting real police reform, firing killer cops, addressing the systemic and constant racism. Justice would have been addressing the economic inequality, wage theft, exploitation and poverty that plague every worker. Justice would have been listening to those of us who have been demanding changes for years.” Praise for coordinated efforts Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson issued a statement Sunday praising city officials for how they handled the protests and riots, while also committing to continue working with the Unified Police Department and Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera to “focus on de-escalation and employees receive robust training on racial bias.” “I am proud that Salt Lake City’s officers and those who assisted last night showed restraint, and that while property damage is extensive there seems to be limited personal injury due to the riot,” Wilson said. Brown thanked the numerous Wasatch Front police agencies and Air and Army National Guard units for assisting his department Saturday. The chief said his officers were “exhausted.” And despite having everything from rocks and bricks to water bottles and even water-valve covers thrown at them, the officers are not discouraged from doing their jobs. “It’s what they do,” he said. “They signed on to do this job. It’s in their DNA. They are here to serve and protect.”",0.0

Police from a range of agencies were out in numbers Sunday in Salt Lake City patrolling the sparsely populated streets while National Guard forces, who were activated Saturday by Gov. Gary Herbert, remained at the ready. During a Zoom news conference Sunday morning, Mendenhall and Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown lamented the damage done Saturday but assured residents the city will clean up, heal, rebound and keep working for reforms to wipe out “systemic racism.” “Exercise grace,” Mendenhall urged residents. “Yesterday was heartbreaking for our city and across the country.” Brown said law enforcement — from a number of agencies across the Wasatch Front — made 46 arrests during Saturday’s confrontations. Most of the busts were for failure to disperse; some were for assaults on officers and curfew violations. His department said 21 officers were treated for injuries, with heat exhaustion being a common ailment as temperatures soared into the upper 80s. The chief said one officer was struck in the back of the head with a baseball bat. The officer was wearing a helmet, he added, which helped prevent a more serious injury or even death. Brown turned emotional when asked about how his troops were feeling Sunday after the tense clashes that lasted well into Saturday night. “They’re exhausted,” he said, choking back tears. “... But they will never give up.” Article continues below Utah Against Police Brutality, the law enforcement watchdog group that had organized a peaceful car caravan as a protest, which eventually mushroomed into unrest, issued a statement Sunday that made no mention of the widespread property damage or objects thrown at officers. The statement focused on what Salt Lake City leaders have not done to enhance civilian oversight of the police and mentioned by name some of those who have been shot and killed by officers in Utah. “Mayor Mendenhall said that the events around the May 30th protest aren’t what justice looks like,” the group’s statement said. “We agree. This is what a demand looks like, a demand that can’t be ignored any longer. Justice would have been enacting real police reform, firing killer cops, addressing the systemic and constant racism. Justice would have been addressing the economic inequality, wage theft, exploitation and poverty that plague every worker.” Black Lives Matter Utah organizers, who said they have been blamed for the protest, decried the property damage and violence, stressing that the application to the chapter requires that people agree not to engage in such activities. Lex Scott, one of the founding members, said Sunday night that any members of the Utah group who had been involved in violent forms of protest would be removed from the chapter. And she promised she would “testify against them myself” in court. “Destroying properties and setting fires cannot be your only activism,” Scott said. ""If your activism only consists of destruction and not building, that is not activism. That is also not what this movement is about. This movement, the Black Lives Matter movement, has never been about inciting violence and destroying property. This movement has always been about fighting against police violence and fighting for black lives.” Scott encouraged the hundreds of people at the protest to attend a meeting with Black Lives Matter, engage in community building, sign petitions for police reform, and get involved in seeking lasting change. Tackling ‘systemic racism’ (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) A window is damaged at the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City on Sunday, May 31, 2020.  On Sunday afternoon, Mendenhall reaffirmed her commitment to pursue such lasting change. She talked about the need to create “transformative"" reforms to erase racial and gender inequalities in the city and pointed to an order she gave earlier this year to create an equity plan. The City Council has since approved funding to create such a plan. Mendenhall encouraged residents to go to www.slc.gov/transparentpolicing/ to learn more about it and participate. “This is also about confronting racism,"" she said, “and no longer, as a community, remaining silent.” Brown said he supports Americans using their constitutional right to protest, but when violence breaks out, law enforcement must step in. He praised the officers’ overall response, saying he thought they did “an exceptional job.” Mendenhall insisted that the city is committed to operating an ethical and transparent police department. The mayor, Brown and the City Council released a statement Saturday asking all residents to “come together to intentionally address and dismantle the systemic oppression, discrimination, racism, and bigotry that exist in our city."" ""The fear, anger, hurt, and frustration felt by so many in our community is justified, and we cannot allow its source to continue unaddressed.” Scott said she has been working with the Salt Lake City Police Department over the past few years on reforms. The city has implemented deescalation training and bias training, while replacing lethal weapons in cars with nonlethal ones. But arguing that change would be more effective on the national level, Scott has written a federal reform bill that would require all police departments involved in misconduct to be investigated by democratically elected, independent civilian review boards with the power to investigate officers and bring charges against them. She urged activists to sign her petition online calling for enactment of the bill and for Utah legislators to support meaningful changes locally — even if it’s not through her legislation. “The only way you stop cities from burning is police reform,” Scott said. Theresa Martinez, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Utah whose research focuses on race, class, gender and inequality, said the Salt Lake City protest and its violence were “not surprising,” given the factors that converged Saturday. She listed what she called “generations” of police brutality and the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted people of color and further exposed inequalities. There’s also a political divide that can set off clashes — even over whether someone is wearing a mask during the COVID-19 outbreak. “And then the fact that everyone is already on edge,"" Martinez said, “from being stuck in their homes.” There have been other examples in the past week and historically of people coopting a peaceful protest for violent purposes, Martinez said. The only way organizers can screen out those who would destroy property or assault police is to schedule the demonstration at a time and place that minimize when such people would attend. Even then, it’s hard to keep away those elements once the event has started and been spread by the press and shared on social media. Martinez said Salt Lake City police “did an admirable job” of minimizing the violence and damage. Some Utahns are probably shocked such a protest happened here, she said, but the Salt Lake City protest was relatively mild compared to what occurred in other cities. Still, Martinez advised Mendenhall and the other mayors and police chiefs around Utah to listen to the protesters — at least the nonviolent ones — and hear their concerns. “When the dust clears,"" she said, “if [public officials] don’t start talking about those issues, these things will happen again.” Police response under review (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) A rifle is melted into the pavement where a police car was also burned outside the downtown library in Salt Lake City. Sunday, May 31, 2020. Mendenhall encouraged protesters and others who witnessed any inappropriate responses from police Saturday to contact the city. She said an “after-action review” of the demonstration and police actions would be conducted. In addition, Mendenhall and Brown asked witnesses to step forward who may have witnessed an incident with a man who allegedly wielded a bow and arrow in targeting protesters between City Hall and the Main Library — the area that became the epicenter of Saturday’s unrest. Brown said the man showing up with this weapon was “troubling"" and a “horrible situation.” Police are screening possible charges. The Salt Lake City Police Department tweeted that it was working to identify others who may be charged with vandalism, assault and theft. The chief suggested that he suspects at least some of the more confrontational demonstrators were “outsiders,"" though he offered little evidence to substantiate that assertion. A review of court documents identified four people booked into the Salt Lake County jail in relation to the protest. Two were arrested on suspicion of felony criminal mischief for throwing rocks though the window of the Matheson Courthouse on State Street, across the road from City Hall. One person was booked into jail on suspicion of misdemeanor counts of assault on a peace officer and failure to disperse. One other person was also arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor count of failure to disperse. All four were released after being booked, according to jail and court records. It will be up to prosecutors whether to file charges. Public records show at least three of those arrested are from Utah. Bail help for protesters (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A car burns after a protest against police brutality turned violent in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money in support of those arrested. “These funds will be used for bail/bond costs for those arrested, including retroactive reimbursements,” wrote David Newlin, an organizer with Utah Against Police Brutality and a former Salt Lake Tribune staffer. “Any remaining funds will be used to pay for any continuing support of those arrested based on the needs of particular individuals, as well as the continued support of UAPB’s efforts to fight police brutality in Salt Lake and Utah.” The campaign already had mustered more than $34,000 by Sunday evening, exceeding the goal of $15,000. Mendenhall said the review of the police response will include what transpired in a video where officers are seen pushing an elderly man to the ground. The video was being shared on social media Sunday. “It’s not OK,” the mayor said in an interview. “It seems to be well outside the protocol and it’s being investigated.” Mendenhall said she did not speak to any of the protesters. Not doing so was part of the strategic decision to keep city officials away from the demonstrators and give them room to protest until the curfew. During Sunday morning’s news conference, she said police and city officials made a “calculated decision” not to stop protesters at the start, reasoning that windows could be replaced and graffiti cleaned up. She said preserving lives was the main priority. Mendenhall said that many Utahns have reached out to help tidy up the city after the protest, which brought broken glass and graffiti to the heart of downtown. But she asked residents to hold off — especially with the curfew still in effect, though she noted cleanup efforts are exempted from the clampdown. “Stay home for now,” she said, “and let us get our arms around the cleanup.” Salt Lake City has a graffiti-abatement program that sends city workers or contractors to remove spray paint and other markings. Mendenhall said it will be used to help clean public and private buildings sullied in Saturday’s protests. The state had volunteers and employees out Sunday scrubbing the Utah Capitol, which got pasted in places with graffiti. Don Gamble, a retired corrections officer who volunteered to help clean up the Capitol under guidance from professional crews, was there Sunday. “This place was built on my taxes,” he said. “This was an assault on me. It just saddens me people can’t find other ways to make their point.” Herbert tweeted that he met with the crews Sunday and thanked them for “stepping up right and left — cleaning in the hot sun, offering cool water, and dropping off pizza.” (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) Don Gamble cleans up graffiti at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Sunday, May 31, 2020.  ‘It got out of hand’ The downtown streets were largely quiet and void of crowds Sunday, save for police, cleanup crews and some folks walking their dogs, heading to jobs or buying supplies. Sitting beside the steps of City Hall in Washington Square, Ronny Gonzales worked on his Dell laptop, using the outdoor power plugs to charge his computer. Gonzales, a 64-year-old veteran, is part of Salt Lake City’s homeless population. While the entire city is under curfew through Monday morning, the order doesn’t apply to the homeless. Gonzales said he usually doesn’t linger around the downtown area much but that he was around Saturday, when the peaceful demonstration turned violent. “It got out of hand — extremely,” he said. He believes the curfew will calm things down. “It should work,” Gonzales said. “We’ll see. The day is young, but I’m going to bet there’ll be some that try to riot later.” Mendenhall, who said in the afternoon she had heard of no further protests Sunday, pointed out the curfew remains set to expire Monday at 6 a.m., adding that she is leery of lifting it too soon. Officials also said the curfew could be extended, depending on conditions in the city. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah expressed reservations about the curfew, tweeting that the “unprecedented and extraordinary measure” could lead to “selective enforcement in certain neighborhoods” and urging leaders to shift to a less-restrictive approach. Herbert activated 200 soldiers and airmen from the Utah National Guard. That included about 30 airmen from the Utah Air National Guard’s 151st Security Forces Squadron. Such units typically provide both ground defense and military police. Maj. Jamie Thomas wrote in an email that all the personnel were there “to assist law enforcement partners to protect life, preserve property, and uphold the rule of law to include the right to peacefully protest.” She did not offer more specifics on the military’s role during the curfew or otherwise. A National Guard Black Hawk helicopter flew over the Salt Lake City protests for hours Saturday. (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) National Guard troops block the intersection at 200 East 400 South in Salt Lake City on Sunday, May 31, 2020.  The day’s protest, organized by Utah Against Police Brutality, began peacefully with a car caravan. That display, however, later spilled into the streets as more people arrived than could be contained in cars. The protest persisted for the next 11 hours. Protesters were angry about the death of George Floyd, a black man who died earlier this week after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Other police use of deadly force, including in Utah, also drew rebukes. Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson, echoing other elected Utah leaders, said she shares the “deep anger felt for the loss of George Floyd’s life."" “I am saddened,” she said in a statement Sunday, “that we continue to see instances where crime is committed by law enforcement at the expense of people of color.” She voiced support for the restraint shown Saturday by Salt Lake City’s officers, and pleaded with protesters to “find peaceful and civil means to express themselves.” Mendenhall emphasized that dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, something she’s constantly worried about, still is a top priority. She pointed out that Salt Lake City remains in the orange, moderate-risk phase for COVID-19, with intense concentration of cases in ZIP code 84116, which includes downtown. “Particularly after those last couple of days with very high numbers of positive cases reporting,"" Mendenhall said, “that is an ever-present concern for us.” Social distancing, of course, went virtually unheeded during Saturday’s protest.",0.0

The chief suggested that he suspects at least some of the more confrontational demonstrators were “outsiders,"" though he offered little evidence to substantiate that assertion. A review of court documents identified four people booked into the Salt Lake County jail in relation to the protest. Two were arrested on suspicion of felony criminal mischief for throwing rocks though the window of the Matheson Courthouse on State Street, across the road from City Hall. One person was booked into jail on suspicion of misdemeanor counts of assault on a peace officer and failure to disperse. One other person was also arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor count of failure to disperse. All four were released after being booked, according to jail and court records. It will be up to prosecutors whether to file charges. Public records show at least three of those arrested are from Utah. Bail help for protesters (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A car burns after a protest against police brutality turned violent in Salt Lake City on Saturday, May 30, 2020. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money in support of those arrested. “These funds will be used for bail/bond costs for those arrested, including retroactive reimbursements,” wrote David Newlin, an organizer with Utah Against Police Brutality and a former Salt Lake Tribune staffer. “Any remaining funds will be used to pay for any continuing support of those arrested based on the needs of particular individuals, as well as the continued support of UAPB’s efforts to fight police brutality in Salt Lake and Utah.” The campaign already had mustered more than $34,000 by Sunday evening, exceeding the goal of $15,000. Mendenhall said the review of the police response will include what transpired in a video where officers are seen pushing an elderly man to the ground. The video was being shared on social media Sunday. “It’s not OK,” the mayor said in an interview. “It seems to be well outside the protocol and it’s being investigated.” Mendenhall said she did not speak to any of the protesters. Not doing so was part of the strategic decision to keep city officials away from the demonstrators and give them room to protest until the curfew. During Sunday morning’s news conference, she said police and city officials made a “calculated decision” not to stop protesters at the start, reasoning that windows could be replaced and graffiti cleaned up. She said preserving lives was the main priority. Mendenhall said that many Utahns have reached out to help tidy up the city after the protest, which brought broken glass and graffiti to the heart of downtown. But she asked residents to hold off — especially with the curfew still in effect, though she noted cleanup efforts are exempted from the clampdown. “Stay home for now,” she said, “and let us get our arms around the cleanup.” Salt Lake City has a graffiti-abatement program that sends city workers or contractors to remove spray paint and other markings. Mendenhall said it will be used to help clean public and private buildings sullied in Saturday’s protests. The state had volunteers and employees out Sunday scrubbing the Utah Capitol, which got pasted in places with graffiti. Don Gamble, a retired corrections officer who volunteered to help clean up the Capitol under guidance from professional crews, was there Sunday. “This place was built on my taxes,” he said. “This was an assault on me. It just saddens me people can’t find other ways to make their point.” Herbert tweeted that he met with the crews Sunday and thanked them for “stepping up right and left — cleaning in the hot sun, offering cool water, and dropping off pizza.” (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) Don Gamble cleans up graffiti at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Sunday, May 31, 2020.  ‘It got out of hand’ The downtown streets were largely quiet and void of crowds Sunday, save for police, cleanup crews and some folks walking their dogs, heading to jobs or buying supplies. Sitting beside the steps of City Hall in Washington Square, Ronny Gonzales worked on his Dell laptop, using the outdoor power plugs to charge his computer. Gonzales, a 64-year-old veteran, is part of Salt Lake City’s homeless population. While the entire city is under curfew through Monday morning, the order doesn’t apply to the homeless. Gonzales said he usually doesn’t linger around the downtown area much but that he was around Saturday, when the peaceful demonstration turned violent. “It got out of hand — extremely,” he said. He believes the curfew will calm things down. “It should work,” Gonzales said. “We’ll see. The day is young, but I’m going to bet there’ll be some that try to riot later.” Mendenhall, who said in the afternoon she had heard of no further protests Sunday, pointed out the curfew remains set to expire Monday at 6 a.m., adding that she is leery of lifting it too soon. Officials also said the curfew could be extended, depending on conditions in the city. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah expressed reservations about the curfew, tweeting that the “unprecedented and extraordinary measure” could lead to “selective enforcement in certain neighborhoods” and urging leaders to shift to a less-restrictive approach. Herbert activated 200 soldiers and airmen from the Utah National Guard. That included about 30 airmen from the Utah Air National Guard’s 151st Security Forces Squadron. Such units typically provide both ground defense and military police. Maj. Jamie Thomas wrote in an email that all the personnel were there “to assist law enforcement partners to protect life, preserve property, and uphold the rule of law to include the right to peacefully protest.” She did not offer more specifics on the military’s role during the curfew or otherwise. A National Guard Black Hawk helicopter flew over the Salt Lake City protests for hours Saturday. (Jeremy Harmon | The Salt Lake Tribune) National Guard troops block the intersection at 200 East 400 South in Salt Lake City on Sunday, May 31, 2020.  The day’s protest, organized by Utah Against Police Brutality, began peacefully with a car caravan. That display, however, later spilled into the streets as more people arrived than could be contained in cars. The protest persisted for the next 11 hours. Protesters were angry about the death of George Floyd, a black man who died earlier this week after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Other police use of deadly force, including in Utah, also drew rebukes. Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson, echoing other elected Utah leaders, said she shares the “deep anger felt for the loss of George Floyd’s life."" “I am saddened,” she said in a statement Sunday, “that we continue to see instances where crime is committed by law enforcement at the expense of people of color.” She voiced support for the restraint shown Saturday by Salt Lake City’s officers, and pleaded with protesters to “find peaceful and civil means to express themselves.” Mendenhall emphasized that dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, something she’s constantly worried about, still is a top priority. She pointed out that Salt Lake City remains in the orange, moderate-risk phase for COVID-19, with intense concentration of cases in ZIP code 84116, which includes downtown. “Particularly after those last couple of days with very high numbers of positive cases reporting,"" Mendenhall said, “that is an ever-present concern for us.” Social distancing, of course, went virtually unheeded during Saturday’s protest.",0.0

Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence.

In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting “I can't breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.'' It denounced Floyd's death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most deadly police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts.

As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it’s not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ""Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Article continues below Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said.

1621630066,2020-05-31 12:00:44,"After Protests, Salt Lake City Curfew Remains And Cleanup Begins",https://www.kuer.org/post/after-protests-salt-lake-city-curfew-remains-and-cleanup-begins,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Sunday morning the city’s streets are “quiet and calm” after Saturday’s protests against police brutality turned violent. But Mendenhall cautioned against prematurely lifting a citywide curfew that went into effect 8 p.m. Saturday and is scheduled to last until 6 a.m. Monday. The mayor said city officials were assessing property damage caused by vandalism and graffiti, but it was too early to determine how many buildings were affected or how much it would cost the city. Protesters bashed in windows of squad cars, threw eggs at and spray painted the Salt Lake City Police Department building and the state Capitol. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said 41 people were arrested following Saturday’s events. Charges include assault on police officers, failure to disperse and violating the city’s curfew. Brown said the Utah National Guard would remain on hand to make sure the situation remains calm. He said police were also working to identify where the people who were arrested are from and that he had a feeling some people came from out of state to incite violence. A Volatile Situation When the protest first kicked off Saturday morning, police presence was low. Brown said that was a strategic decision as Salt Lake City is a place where people can come to express their opinions. “We allowed that yesterday,” Brown said. “And when it turned violent and started to enter into vandalism we took a different course. One of things that’s always to be considered is you don’t want to be a target of a protest. And we knew going in we would be.” What started as a peaceful protest Saturday morning had, by late afternoon, turned violent. Police officers formed a barricade outside the Salt Lake City and County Building, with hundreds of demonstrators staring back at them. While mostly a standoff, the night was punctuated by outbursts and confrontations between protestors and police — demonstrators threw glass and plastic bottles, rocks and other projectiles. Fireworks could also be heard occasionally going off, though it wasn’t clear where they were coming from. Officers responded with nonlethal rounds and hit protestors with batons. After the curfew went into effect at 8 p.m., more officers joined the ranks, including members of the National Guard, and began pushing the demonstrators several blocks south. Officers had made a few arrests throughout the night for assault, but began rounding up the remaining demonstrators shortly after 10 p.m. Brown said 21 officers were treated for medical issues. One officer was hit in the back of the helmet with a baseball bat, while others suffered from heat exhaustion. The police chief also commended his crew, saying they withstood being spat on and having a litany of objects thrown at them. “They’re exhausted,” Brown said, pausing momentarily as he was overcome with emotion. “They’re tired but they will never give up. They’re good people.” The Clean Up Process Mendenhall said street sweepers were out overnight and city officials have received calls from volunteers offering to help in the cleaning effort. But she cautioned them to let the city get organized first before coming out to help. “The trash is not going anywhere,” she said. “The spray paint is not going anywhere. We want to go about it in an appropriate way. Please let this curfew stand. Let’s not compromise the safety and security of our residents by sending people out who mean to do well.” Mendenhall noted that graffiti removal could lead to more damage if not done in the right way. But she said she is grateful for the spirit of volunteers cropping up around this. The Next Step Both Mendenhall and Brown asked for help from the community as authorities reviewed the protest and its aftermath. In particular, they referenced a video of a man who, during the protest, appeared with a bow and arrow which he aimed and shot at someone before being rushed by a number of bystanders. Editor’s note: The video of the incident can be seen here but it includes violent content and graphic language. He was also later seen wielding a machete. Brown said he was disturbed by seeing that. Both he and the mayor asked for witnesses to come forward and offer information about the incident. The man in the video spoke to a local reporter, but police have yet to make an arrest. The city is also inviting people to submit complaints if they had any interaction with officers yesterday that they think involved an inappropriate use of force. Brown said in the coming weeks he hopes to sit down with community members and have a conversation about what his officers could do better. Mendenhall said the city is focused on being transparent and having these conversations with stakeholders. Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson released a statement Sunday morning saying she was saddened to continue to see instances where crime is committed by law enforcement at the expense of people of color. “Freedom of expression is one of the most fundamental rights in a free society,” Wilson said. “Voices long ignored, have every right to be heard. But it is my sincere hope that protesters will find peaceful and civil means to express themselves.” Wilson offered the county’s Council of Diversity Affairs as a resource to help initiate conversations between minority communities and the police.",0.0

Most of the people were arrested for failure to disperse while a few were booked on suspicion of breaking a curfew and assault on a police officer, said Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown during a briefing with reporters. He said his agency was working to get more details about the people arrested, including where they live because he believes people from outside Utah came to instigate the violence. A total of 21 police officers received medical care and one police officer was hit in the back of the head with a bat, Brown said. He said his agency is also investigating reports about a man who aimed a bow and arrow at a group of protesters before he was tackled and his car burned. That man has not been arrested, but Brown said it is a priority investigation. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police. “That was troubling. That was a horrible situation,” Brown said. Mendenhall enacted the curfew — which lasts until 6 a.m. Monday — and Gov. Gary Herbert activated the Utah National Guard after thousands converged on the downtown area Saturday afternoon.

But some protesters turned to violence and vandalism, setting two cars on fire and attacking police officers, who responded with tear gas. Men carrying rifles stood on top of the wreckage of a burned police car. What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” Floyd, a black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station in Salt Lake City. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Graffiti was also written on the state Capitol.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) (Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP) The extent and cost of the damage was still being assessed on Sunday, Mendenhall said. The Democratic former city councilwoman who is in her first year as mayor said the protests illustrate deeper societal issues that must be addressed. “We are all hurting from this week and yesterday in particular was heartbreaking for our city and cities across the country, but this is about something much deeper and longer lasting than a protest or a riot,” Mendenhall said. “We will recover and we will recover coming together to rebuild policies and to address, unearth, unpack the systemic racism that exists in this city and in every city across this nation.” Mendenhall and Brown said they will look into any complaints about how officers handled the situation, but called for an end to violence and destruction. “We cannot have meaningful conversations in a riotous situation,” Brown said.

GEORGE — As rallies and protests took place across the nation Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, the Southern Utah Chapter of Black Lives Matter held a rally at the St. George City Offices. The rally was followed that evening by a separate protest of around 200 people on St. George Boulevard. Between 50 and 60 people gathered at the St. George City Offices on 200 East around 10 a.m. to hear from Troy Anderson, founder of the Southern Utah Black Live Matter chapter, and others as well as participate in a “kneel in” along both sides of the street. One of the reasons given for having the rally at the city offices was its proximity to the police station next door. “We’re all connected, and the more we realize that, the better opportunity we will have of working some real change in this country and in our local community,” Anderson said as he addressed the crowd. Anderson shared some of his own experiences of harassment and brutality from law enforcement in the past, including an incident in Cleveland, Ohio, where a police officer accused him of stealing a car and had a gun pressed against the back of his head. Another instance involved a Utah Highway Patrol trooper he said pulled a gun on him after he had been pulled over for speeding. These type of acts are a norm for the black community when it comes to police, Anderson said, adding that police in St. George and the surrounding area also abuse their authority in relation the people of color and it was time to put the area police departments on notice. “I want to send a message to the St. George, to Washington City, to Ivins, Bloomington, all of these cops – we’re here, we’re sick and tired of you harassing us,” he said. “We’re sick and tired of you pulling us over just to pull us over…We’re tired of it. All people of color are tired of it.” According to United States’ Census data, those who identify as black or African-American make up less than 1% of St. George’s population, while others who identify as Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander and so on make up a fifth of the city’s overall population. While expressing his anger over the death of Floyd and a lack of faith that justice would truly be served in the matter – he wants to see the officer responsible for Floyd’s death on death row for it – Anderson said he hopes for a better future than the one he and other people of color of experienced. To the assembled crowd, he asked them not to be keyboard warriors, but to become involved. “My message to you is to get involved,” he said. “Learn about the systemic racism, learn what it is and how it works in this country.” Standing with Anderson was Sydni Makemo, the Southern Utah community outreach fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union. She helped organize Saturday morning’s event and also urged people to get involved and get educated, especially white people who made up the majority of the morning’s crowd. “The first and most important thing you can do is listen to impacted communities so you can learn better on how to be an ally,” Makemo said. She also urged people to learn about who is running for political office and vote for those candidates who represent their values while also showing an ability to help marginalized communities if elected. Police accountability and criminal justice reform are issues the candidates need to push, she said. People also need to reach out to their current lawmakers and tell them the harassment and killing of people of color by the authorities has to stop, Makemo said. However, she warned about potential or perceived acts of violence against local lawmakers from those seeking change, especially since many have their phone numbers and sometimes addresses posted online at Utah.gov and and readily accessible. “Black Lives Matter does not support violence,” she said. “We don’t instigate that, because that takes away from the message.” While the gathering at the St. George City Office, and the later protest held at the intersection of 200 East and St. George Boulevard were primarily peaceful – and loud in the latter case – violent riots occurred in Salt Lake City and other large cities across the nation Saturday. Floyd died on Memorial Day after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes after he stopped moving and pleading for air, leading to protests in cities across the U.S. in the days since. The officer was fired along with three other officers involved, and was subsequently charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Concerning the riots, Anderson said peaceful protests has never had any positive impact when it came to fighting systemic racism. “What you’re seeing in these neighborhoods – yes there are people coming in that have nothing to do with our cause that are causing problems, like criminals and stuff – it’s just pent up rage. That’s all it really is. And this is how they’re going to get attention.” he said. “Those buildings and stuff that have been burned, those can be replaced, but human lives can’t be replaced. “This is another black person being killed indiscriminately by law enforcement and it just happened to get caught on tape,” he said. “But this is nothing new in black communities, the way these cops are handling black people.” The crowd soon moved from the St. George City Office parking lot where they had gathered and lined both sides of 200 East leading up to the St. George Police Department. Rally attendees who were able to kneeled on one knee six feet apart with many holding up signs that read “Black lives matter,” “White silence is violence,” “George Floyd” along with other messages. The crowd also occasionally chanted “No justice, no peace,” and “Black lives matter” and cheered as cars drove by and honked in support. St. George Mayor Jon Pike also arrived at the city offices and spoke with Anderson for a few minutes with plans to continue a dialogue soon after. “It’s great to have a nice turnout here and bring some awareness,” Pike said, adding that while the issue that sparked the rally was miles away, it was important to realize an incident of police brutality can happen anywhere, though he said he hopes it never happens in St. George. “We need to be mindful as a government, as a police department and as a community to make sure we are the kind of community that’s welcoming and that’s mindful of all people,” Pike said. While the mayor said he believes the city’s police officers to be well-trained and great examples of law enforcement, he said it is also important to be ever-training and ever-developing and using best practices when it comes to interacting with others. Making sure city government and police are listening to the community is also very important, he said. “That’s the main thing – communication and making sure if there’s a place we could do better that we listen and get input,” the mayor said. “If there are additional needs the community had additional training we as city officials and employees need to have, I’m all about that and I know the city is as well.” The crowd gathered at the city offices dispersed around noon, with a number of them returning to particulate in a much larger protest at 5 p.m. that initially took place at the street corner by the Iceberg restaurant, then spread to all corners of the intersection as it gradually grew.

A tweet from Salt Lake City Police Department Sunday morning said: “21 officers injured, one seriously. 41 arrested; most for failure to disperse, a few for assault on a police officer, and some for curfew. We are currently working to identify other individuals that we will be screening charges against for crimes of vandalism, assault, and theft.” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has declared a curfew for Salt Lake City, to last from 8 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Monday morning. Residents were sent the following public safety alert on their phones: “Salt Lake City curfew effective until June 1 at 6 a.m. within Salt Lake City limits. People may not be on a public street or in any public place. Exceptions; police, fire, medical personnel, media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling to and from the airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness.” Businesses will not be closed, and Mendenhall added in a tweet that attending church services and patronizing private businesses are also exemptions. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert tweeted at 11 p.m. Saturday: “Unless you are defined as an essential person, please steer clear of the downtown area through the remainder of the weekend. “We were deeply saddened to see the defacement of our beautiful Capitol building by this weekend’s protesters. We are heartened by the many individuals wanting to help clean its stone walls and grounds. “Due to the historic and delicate nature of the building, and the ongoing curfew (expires on Monday at 6 a.m.), we are going to rely on professionals from the state of Utah to clean and restore the exterior walls and surfaces. Herbert called in the National Guard and police from multiple northern Utah law enforcement agencies were called to downtown Salt Lake City and the state Capitol. The protest was peaceful until shortly after 3 p.m., when protesters near the Salt Lake City Police Department crowded around a patrol car, flipped it, sprayed paint on it, bashed out the windows, and set it ablaze. As many protesters left the downtown area for the state Capitol, a few remained downtown to loot a 7-Eleven. Several stores at the City Creek mall also were looted. At the Capitol, more than two dozen Utah Highway Patrol troopers and other first responders stood peacefully around the steps, most with their hands clasped in front of them. Protesters used spray paint to vandalize the grounds, and yelled at the officers. At about 5:20 p.m., a second car was destroyed after a man got out of it, then pointed a bow and arrow at the crowd. Bystanders began to beat the man, who was rescued by police in riot gear. The man later told reporters he had shouted out his car window, “All lives matter,” and was surprised it angered protesters enough that they started beating him as he tried to escape with his only available weapon, the bow and arrow. The event began quietly in the late morning, and was intended to draw attention to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, who died Monday after a police officer used his knee to force his neck into the roadway for an extended period of time. Floyd told the officer he was in pain, he begged for air, and then he said the police were going to kill him. Onlookers recorded video and begged the officer to let Floyd breathe. Floyd died shortly afterward at a hospital. The Salt Lake City protest began calmly, with people in cars chanting Floyd’s name, “Black lives matter” or “I can’t breathe.” Police stayed back, and mostly out of sight, allowing people to express their feelings. By 7:15 p.m., the protest bore no resemblance to the event that started about eight hours earlier. Protesters stood in a wall, feet from a line of officers in riot gear, shield to shield, as the minutes passed before the curfew. Armored vehicles idled nearby. At 7:33 p.m., police began to advance after a metal object, reportedly a trash can, was thrown at them. A protester jumped on an officer, and multiple other officers jumped on the young man, then picked him up and led him away, hands secured behind his back. The 8 p.m. curfew deadline came and went without the crowd clearing out. More officers arrived to support the hundreds who had arrived earlier from dozens of agencies in northern Utah. Among them were officers from Ogden, which lost a team member, Officer Nate Lyday, just two days earlier when he was fatally shot while responding to a domestic violence call. By 8:30 p.m., dusk was approaching and the standoff continued. The number of officers appeared to be increasing. At 9 p.m., night had fallen and a jail transport bus had arrived at the scene. A few minutes later, the police line pushed forward, forcing the protesters to retreat. A few struggled to hold their ground, but many began to disperse. By 9:30 p.m., the police line had advanced by a block, forcing protesters to retreat the same distance. Police used bullhorns to state the protest was illegal, and people needed to go on. With protester ranks thinning, the officers outnumbered them by about two to one. By 10:10 p.m., officers began arresting protesters who had not dispersed, and started putting them onto jail buses for transport and processing, including the filing of charges. Salt Lake City Mayor Jenny Wilson issued the following statement Sunday morning: Last evening was a very difficult time for our community. I share the deep anger felt for the loss of George Floyd’s life in a deliberate act of violence. I am saddened that we continue to see instances where crime is committed by law enforcement at the expense of people of color. I am proud that Salt Lake City’s officers and those who assisted last night showed restraint and that while property damage is extensive there seems to be limited personal injury due to the riot. Freedom of expression is one of the most fundamental rights in a free society. Voices long ignored, have every right to be heard. But it is my sincere hope that protesters will find peaceful and civil means to express themselves. As yesterday’s protest turned to violence, I was humbled by the courage of many elected officials and community leaders of color, several who represent Salt Lake City. These leaders stood together to share their unique perspective as champions for justice in our community. Our only African American State Representative, Sandra Hollins emphasized that the protesters efforts to share opposition to systemic racism was overshadowed by the violence. As the County Mayor, I look forward to embracing the message of these leaders and, in partnerships, expanding the dialogue in our community. I will offer my Council of Diversity Affairs as a resource to support conversations surrounding our criminal justice system and policing. I also will continue my strong partnership with Sheriff Rosie Rivera, who I coordinated with throughout the night, and who also showed concern for all officers on the scene but for the protesters as well. We will regroup to ensure that the Unified Police Department and the Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office continue to focus on de-escalation and employees receive robust training on racial bias. As Salt Lake County Mayor, I am committed to the ongoing work towards justice and opportunity and will remain committed to a County where safety and prosperity are paramount.

I’m also really grateful for the work of the Salt Lake City Police Department and the support of many neighboring police agencies in addition to the Utah Highway Patrol and the National Guard. “Yesterday morning along with the Salt Lake City Police Department and the Salt Lake City Council I released a letter to our Salt Lake City residents about where we stand on transparent policing. As a city we meant every word we said and that statement is no different this morning than it was yesterday morning before the protest. We are united in our work and we acknowledge we can always do better as a city and as a police department. We’re committed to doing that work with our community. “Even before yesterday’s events we had begun discussions with community leaders of color to help advise and review on our policies. We want to ensure transparent and equitable policing and we want that to be an evolving piece of work that is ever striving to improve. With that in mind, following yesterday’s events I’ve asked Police Chief Mike Brown for a thorough after-action review of our police department’s response to protesters. “If you were downtown yesterday and you believe there were any instances of inappropriate force I ask that you file a complaint. You can do that through the web, email, phone, and the reports can be anonymous; there is no wrong way to make a complaint, and this is something that Salt Lake City Police Department has always had available. “These reports are investigated by our internal affairs department, but I’m also making the request that the civilian reviewer board, which is comprised of volunteers representing all seven districts of Salt Lake City, that they review any allegations of inappropriate use of force. In addition, if anyone had any interactions with or witnessed the actions of a man with a bow and arrow yesterday who came into the crowd, please call and make a report to our police department. That information will help us build our case against him, and we ask that you reach out. “Today, we will continue to see Salt Lake City Police Department on our streets and assisting agencies helping us keep the peace. Our city employees are in the process of assessing all the infrastructure damage and they’ve already begun some of the recovery efforts; I know our street sweepers have been out this morning and the streets are looking pretty good. “I know a lot of people are reaching out and asking how they can help the city; I have heard from residents and mayors, people from areas even on the Wasatch Back asking if they can come in and help volunteer. We even saw this morning a pretty huge pile of yard trash bags that had been filled, tied up and left outside our City and County Building where people came out and did some cleanup on their own, between the time I went to bed and early this morning. Thank you. We’re grateful, and we hope to have some organized opportunities later today, we’ll let you know when those become available. We’re still assessing the damage and safety, particularly during COVID-19. We’re asking people to stay home for now and let us get our arms around the cleanup opportunities as we see them. “We do want to direct any energy and spirit that is being felt around volunteerism and helping; it’s such a beautifully unique Utah quality that we have, and I again urge people to exercise grace. We are all hurting from this week, and yesterday in particular was heartbreaking for our city and cities across the country, but this is about something much deeper and longer lasting than a protest or a riot and we know that. Please be kind to one another, reach out to your neighbors, check in on each other. We will recover, and we will recover by coming together, to rebuild policies and to address, unearth, unpack this systemic racism that exists in this city and in every city across this nation. We’re ready to get to work.”",0.0
1621736210,2020-05-31 15:36:55,How national religious leaders reacted to this weekend’s protests over racial violence,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/5/31/21276195/protests-riots-george-floyd-race-religion-catholic-baptist-muslim-jewish-racial-violence,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"SALT LAKE CITY — Racial injustice, police brutality and violent protests are symptoms of America’s spiritual sickness, and people of faith must work to build a better world, according to leaders from a variety of religious traditions. In statements and reflections released this weekend, they applauded protesters raising their voices against injustice and urged officials to listen to the experiences of people of color. Sacred texts celebrate the humanity of all people and secular policies must do the same, faith leaders said. Here’s a sampling of religious leaders’ reactions to George Floyd’s death last week in Minneapolis under the knee of a police officer, and the protests taking place this weekend across the country. Bishop Michael Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, called on church members to continue fighting for racial justice long after protest stories are no longer front-page news. “Opening and changing hearts does not happen overnight. The Christian race is not a sprint; it is a marathon. Our prayers and our work for justice, healing and truth-telling must be unceasing. Let us recommit ourselves to following in the footsteps of Jesus, the way that leads to healing, justice and love,” he said in a reflection released Saturday. Bishop Curry also delivered a sermon on remaining hopeful in challenging times Sunday morning at Washington National Cathedral. He called on listeners to choose love over hate and trust that needed change is coming. “If I make room for you, and you make room for me, and if we will work together to create a society where there is room for all of God’s children, where every human being, every one of us is treated as a child of God, created in the image and likeness of God, where everybody is loved, everybody is honored, everybody is respected, everybody is created as a child of God. If we work together to build that kind of society and don’t give up, then love can save us all,” he said. Seven Catholic leaders with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops joined together to issue a statement on the death of George Floyd and the protests that sprung up in response. They urged Catholics to be mindful of racial inequality in the world and do what they can to fight it. “Racism is not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue to be bandied about when convenient. It is a real and present danger that must be met head on. As members of the church, we must stand for the more difficult right and just actions instead of the easy wrongs of indifference,” the bishops said. They also expressed support for national protests, including those that turned violent. “While it is expected that we will plead for peaceful non-violent protests, and we certainly do, we also stand in passionate support of communities that are understandably outraged. Too many communities around this country feel their voices are not being heard, their complaints about racist treatment are unheeded, and we are not doing enough to point out that this deadly treatment is antithetical to the Gospel of Life,” they said. Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy director of the Council on America-Islamic Relations, condemned police violence and urged community leaders to respect protesters’ right to peacefully gather. “Engaging in police brutality at a protest against police brutality is a surefire way to escalate the unrest occurring on streets across our nation. The imposition of a curfew does not give any police officer free reign to gas, beat, shoot rubber bullets at, or otherwise attack protesters and journalists,” he said in a statement. Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, released a statement on the need for an end to racial injustice and the importance of continuing to work to build a fairer world. “The national rage expressed about the murder of Mr. Floyd reflects the depth of pain over the injustice that people of color – and particularly black men – have been subjected to throughout the generations. In recent months we have seen, yet again, too many devastating examples of persistent systemic racism,” he said. “Our country simply cannot achieve the values of ‘justice for all’ to which it aspires until we address ongoing racism in all sectors and at all levels of society.” The Rev. William Barber, a prominent Christian social justice leader and preacher, released a “pastoral letter to the nation” Sunday morning, which praised protesters and called for a “radical transformation” of American society. ‘Protestors are right to decry such brutal and inhumane treatment as racism. Thank God people are in the streets, refusing to accept what has been seen as normal for far too long,” he said. The Rev. Barber urged people to look for reasons for hope, but also not to move too quickly away from the discomfort of this moment. “There is a sense in which, right now, we must refuse to be comforted too quickly. Only if these screams and tears and protests shake the very conscience of this nation — and until there is real political and judicial repentance — can we hope for a better society on the other side of this,” he said. Key leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention released a statement emphasizing the sacredness of all human beings and promising to support efforts to build a more just world. “Followers of Jesus Christ cannot remain silent when our brothers and sisters, friends and/or people we seek to win for Christ are mistreated, abused or killed unnecessarily,” they said. The Southern Baptist Convention supports police work, but cannot stay silent when officers abuse their power, the religious leaders said. ‘While we thank God for our law enforcement officers that bravely risk their lives for the sake of others and uphold justice with dignity and integrity, we also lament when some law enforcement officers misuse their authority and bring unnecessary harm on the people they are called to protect,” they said.",0.0

When George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, senselessly dies with the knee of a police officer on his neck; when protests turn violent in cities around America; when politicians across the spectrum, including the leader of the free world, foment anger, fear and frustration; when buildings burn, looting begins, riot gear comes out and loved ones grieve, there are simply no words. When words fail, it’s action that will heal the nation’s hearts. Hate has always been the driving force of destruction in societies and nations. Hate in all its forms — contempt, prejudice, discrimination, petty slurs — leads to fear and frustration. Fear and frustration beget rage and violence. Every American must call out hate for what it is and work to elevate their dialogue, create common ground and end prejudice. In the Declaration of Independence, a document designed to simply list all the grievances the colonists had against the king, it’s no accident the phrase “all men are created equal” was prominently placed. America has been engaged in the conflict to bring the nation’s behavior up to this ideal ever since. To move forward, the country must get comfortable having uncomfortable conversations — about the past, about present challenges and, most importantly, about the future of America. No one who plants thistles in the spring expects to harvest fruit in the fall. No one should ever think that those who perpetually plant hate are expecting to reap love and kindness later. If the nation continues to plant seeds of hate, intolerance, bigotry and contempt, America’s communities will reap bushels of it. More than a political polarization problem, America faces the consuming challenge of contempt — the belief in the utter worthlessness of another individual. When Americans plant contempt, they reap the justification to treat others inhumanely. What is the cure? Stop the shoulder shrugging. Bury the “it’s not my problem” attitude. It is time for citizens to square their shoulders and play a vital role in freedom’s history. It’s in times like these the country quotes words of giants like Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But America really needs to stop talking about them and start acting like them. Looking at the current crisis, all should agree that words fail. But hanging your head in defeat and slouching into a corner is not an option for the United States of America. What can be done? Act on these questions: What message am I sending in my words and rhetoric? Do I treat those different from me with respect and kindness? Am I engaged in elevated dialogue? Do I listen with an open heart and mind? Am I willing to call out hate, injustice and prejudice? Will I admit when I am wrong? If everyone would act on just one of those questions — today — America would begin, even in a very small way, to heal the wounds in families, neighborhoods and the nation. Government is not, cannot and should not be big enough to solve these issues. “We the people” must square our shoulders and do it together. The color, size or strength of those shoulders does not matter. What matters is that each person is willing to square them and work as one to lift this nation toward the fulfillment of the nation’s motto: “Out of many, one.” When other words fail, perhaps those four words will begin anew the quest to prove that all who have been created equal by God will be treated equal by each other.",0.0
1621748070,2020-05-31 16:15:06,Volunteers help clean up after turbulent protest in Salt Lake City,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/5/31/21276139/riot-salt-lake-city-floyd-george-volunteers-help-clean-up-after-turbulent-protest,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"Share All sharing options for: Volunteers help clean up after turbulent protest in Salt Lake City SALT LAKE CITY — When Don Gamble arrived in Salt Lake City and saw the profanity against police stretched across the State of Utah sign on the Capitol grounds, it made him emotional. “It shames me, totally shames me. It’s a shame that people have to express themselves like this. I think there’s other alternatives,” Gamble said. The former corrections officer from Kaysville drove down to the state Capitol early Sunday and joined other volunteers scrubbing off the spray paint in the morning heat. “It’s my taxpayer money that pays for this stuff, and I feel it’s my obligation to do what’s right, not what’s wrong,” Gamble said. He was just one of several groups downtown finding ways to help undo the damage inflicted on public sites when a thousand protesters the night before marched against police brutality and for justice in the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by police. After spending the morning downtown with her team, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said: “Things look much-improved, and we’re in a relatively good place.” But she said it could take several days for the city to fully recover. “I’ve been overwhelmed really by an outpouring of love for our city from residents, fellow cities, and community members and organizations who have offered to volunteer to help clean up and recover, and people who have come down even in the middle of the night, filled dozens of garbage bags, and are helping to put our city back together. I want to thank you for that,” Mendenhall said during a news teleconference early Sunday afternoon. “We originally just came to clean up some garbage, but we came up here and saw the spray paint and just decided to do it,” Jason Terry said as he and his family worked to clean a traffic light post at the intersection of North Temple and State Street. Terry, his wife, and their daughters, ages 15, 13, and 10, also scrubbed profanity on the rock sign of the Brigham Young Memorial Park. He said they focused on profanity and didn’t clean off Black Lives Matter signs. At the Capitol, a few dozen volunteers had been working to remove the extensive graffiti since 8 a.m., said Allyson Gamble, Capitol Preservation Board executive director and no relation to Don Gamble. Professional masons who understand the pores of the granite on the Capitol’s columns worked through the night to completely clean them, she said. Most of the vandalism involved spray paint, traditional paint and litter around the grounds, she said, expressing gratitude that more serious damage wasn’t done. But the paint required strong scrubbing to remove. By about 10:30 a.m., the graffiti appeared just slightly fainter in color. “Because we’ve never had this issue before, we don’t know how long it’s going to take,” Gamble said of the cleanup. Many professionals had called offering their help. “They said that they saw it on TV and they could not sleep. They didn’t want to do anything else, they just wanted to come here and help because we’re Utahns and we band together,” she said. More volunteers were expected to show up throughout the day. As the person who oversees daily operations of the Capitol, she said the damage to the building was unprecedented. “It was shocking, and it really took me by surprise how much there was. And it made me very sad, because this building stands for all people, and all people come and have free speech rights. And we look forward to all different types of thought processes, and nobody’s ever done this. We’ve always had incredible free speech activities,” according to Gamble. “That’s not who we are as Utahns. We can agree to disagree, but this building stands for everybody’s rights.” After viewing the damage to downtown and at the Capitol, Gov. Gary Herbert in a statement called Saturday’s rioting “beyond the pale.” “I was greatly troubled to see the vandalism carried out on the Capitol building, public spaces and private property in our downtown area. I am grateful for the support of law enforcement officers from across the state, and for the support of our National Guard, in restoring law and order to our capital city. These men and women exercised patience and professionalism in de-escalating the situation last night. “Today, as I visited the state Capitol, I saw hope and a spirit of cooperation return as I visited with those who came to clean the building and its grounds. I believe that Utahns are empathetic. I believe that we care about each other. I believe that we will emerge from this difficult week more united and increasingly invested in promoting a just world for all. “I am encouraged to see calm return to Salt Lake City and expect all to comply with the curfew put in place by Mayor Erin Mendenhall,” Herbert said. The cleanup at the Capitol was expected to last all day Sunday. Meanwhile, Liberty Square appeared almost back to normal by about 11 a.m. An officer there said it took about one hour for crews to clean the area, which had been hit hard during the protests with graffiti and trash the day before. But some remnants of the previous night’s chaos remained. A charred stack of electric scooters sat on the sidewalk, just yards away from where a police patrol car had been burned. Rey Dia and Breonah Anderson drove from Ogden to deliver water bottles and other drinks to police officers and those cleaning up. “Just to show officers that we still support them, we’ve got their back, and we appreciate everything that they do for us,” Dia said. Anderson said seeing violence break out during the protest caused her “so much anger. Our men and women put their lives on the line. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a few bad apples, but you can’t go anywhere that there’s not a bad apple. Every fruitful tree has that bad apple. It’s so angering.” As a member of the National Guard, Anderson said the incident felt personal. “They serve right next to us. And if anything came down to it, you’re willing to put on that uniform and do anything, because you know what, they’re people, too. They’re not disposable, they’re human, and they honestly sacrifice a lot to come out here and put their life on the line, like the officer out in Ogden,” she said. “It’s really a wake-up call. People really need to be more respectful. We’re all human,” Anderson said. While many may want to help clean up spray paint, graffiti removal teams are there to do it. Officials don’t want hundreds or thousands of people in the area outside, though clean-up activities are exempt from the curfew, Mendenhall said. She asked residents to help in the recovery effort by supporting downtown businesses. “Look at getting some food tonight, takeout from somewhere in our downtown court. Even better yet, support our minority-owned businesses, our diverse-owned businesses in Salt Lake City. These are ways that we can begin to show our support,” Mendenhall said. “But what we really need from the community and from all the hearts that are breaking and trying to heal right now along with ours is a commitment to the sustained, long-term change that this came about regarding — that the peaceful protests were protesting for, and that we stand in solidarity with — to issue change that is lasting on the systemic racism that continues to oppress even residents of Salt Lake City, probably every city across this nation,” the mayor said. She also asked residents statewide to “render acts of kindness,” and show “grace and generosity and love that is characteristic as who we are as a people.” “Let’s recover from this and begin to heal from this, and create the circumstances for long and lasting change by giving kindness and grace to one another.”",0.0

Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back. “I was just horrified by what I saw,” Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.” “I’m mad, for sure. That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” — Thabo Sefolosha Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer — subsequently charged with murder — pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we’re seeing, I think it’s deeper than that as a culture that’s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That’s just my honest opinion. I think it’s really ... part of a culture where it’s deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days. Sefolosha — a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the Houston Rockets — considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha’s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha’s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders’ organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I’m really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, ‘OK, this is my duty as a human being,’ the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, ‘We are a clan, we stick together no matter what.’ It should be the other way around.” The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. For obvious reasons, Sefolosha’s mind isn’t there yet. “I’ll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,” Sefolosha said. “But you know, we’re human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it’s definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.”",0.0
1621763137,2020-05-31 15:03:00,Trump Lays Blame For Clashes On 'Radical-Left Anarchists',https://www.kuer.org/post/trump-lays-blame-clashes-radical-left-anarchists,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated at 7:27 p.m. ET As overlapping crises convulse an anxious nation, President Trump on Sunday sought to cast blame for widespread protests gripping cities on ""radical-left anarchists,"" while adding that the media ""is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy."" The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" Biden made an unannounced visit on Sunday to the site in Wilmington, Del., where protests had taken place the night before. ",0.0

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

The event in Park City is scheduled from noon until 2 p.m. An online announcement indicated students in Park City have organized the demonstration. According to the organizers, the event is slated to take place at Dozier Field on the Park City High School campus after it was initially planned as a march down Main Street into City Park, where demonstrators intended to kneel in protest and give speeches. The announcement describes the event as a “peaceful protest” and says “no looting, rioting/violence, graffiti etc.” The organizers estimate between 100 and 200 people will attend. The event on Monday will be the first such march or demonstration in Park City since the death. The Park City Police Department at 8 p.m. on Saturday indicated there had not been any incidents related to the death of Floyd and the department in an online posting Sunday morning said there were not any significant incidents on Saturday. Support Local Journalism Donate  The estimated crowd size of between 100 and 200 people would put the event toward the higher end of Park City marches or rallies over the years, which have involved anti-war demonstrations, animal-rights protests and the Women’s March on Main, a giant demonstration in 2017 that drew up to 9,000 people as President Trump took office. Mayor Andy Beerman on Sunday said he supports peaceful demonstrations. He said he does not condone the violence seen during demonstrations elsewhere. Beerman said the death of Floyd was “horrible” and evidence of what he sees as “deep-seated racism” in the U.S. “As a society, we can be and should be much better,” the mayor said.

1621782367,2020-05-31 17:44:37,World alarmed by violence in US; thousands march in London,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/5/31/21276339/u-s-protest-violence-george-floyd-police,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"LONDON — Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.’’ In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.’’ It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,’’ the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.’’ There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. They shouted the names of some victims followed by the word “present!” Rio has one of the most murderous police in Brazil. In 2019 they killed 1,546 people, the highest number since 1998, and much of that was during police operations in favelas. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report.",0.0

In their statement, they said, “This is what happens when elected officials, police departments, and “leaders” ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S. This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence. This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence. Related: 41 people were arrested, 21 officers injured during riots in Salt Lake City “Mayor Mendenhall said that the events around the May 30th protest aren’t what justice looks like. We agree. This is what a demand looks like, a demand that can’t be ignored any longer. Justice would have been enacting real police reform, firing killer cops, addressing the systemic and constant racism. Justice would have been addressing the economic inequality, wage theft, exploitation, and poverty that plague every worker. Justice would have been listening to those of us who have been demanding changes for years. Bernardo, Cody, Patrick, Dillon, Harold, Elijah, and all the other people killed by Utah cops were still alive, or if their killers were in jail. Justice is when people like George Floyd no longer have to fear death at the hands of those who claim to “serve and protect.” “It must be mentioned that protesters demanding an end to racism and police brutality were met with hundreds of cops and many acts of the very brutality that we are seeking to end. They were met with the National Guard. They were met with a curfew. They were met with dozens of arrests. With helicopters, rubber bullets, shields and batons, and the violent force of the very institution they want to reform. Related: ABC 4 News captures police officer armed in protest gear pushing down man with cane “It must also be mentioned that UAPB brought the SLC government a comprehensive police reform proposal called the Salt Lake Civilian Police Accountability Council (SLCPAC). This would have created real community control of the police, an elected, civilian oversight body, that would have held killer cops accountable, that would have saved many lives. They quickly stopped working with us, and in 2019 Utah banned community control of the police outright. SLC supported that ban. Many other groups have also put forward reform proposals or policy suggestions to reign in the racist police violence we are protesting, to little effect.

We have gone to city council meetings. We have met with candidates for office. We have participated in the CAG.

In fact, the Legislature has worked to ban reform and silence protesters at public meetings.

The officers first concern was life safety. It was only later, through the media inquiries and shared footage, that we were able to identify him and the series of events that preceded. If you were a witness to this incident please file a report with us. We know who he is and we are looking to screen charges. Your statements would be extremely helpful. “Now, I’d like to directly address the incident where an elderly gentlemen with a cane was knocked down at the library. We have spent hours searching through the footage to identify the officer involved. We know who it is, and we have begun the investigation. I have seen the video and it was inappropriate. We will follow our procedure, which includes an internal affairs investigation, as well as a review by the civilian review board. They will in turn make a recommendation to me upon completion. I want to say, this is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD. “My expectations are that if people are exercising their first amendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully. I have spoken to this gentleman to express my concern for his well-being and to apologize to him personally. It was hard for me to watch what happened and I know it was even harder for him to experience it. “Overwhelmingly, I saw exemplary professionalism, and thank all the officers for the hours upon hours of standing in the sweltering heat in all their protective gear. They handled a terrible situation with courage and restraint. I am proud of this, and them. “I am relieved there were no fatalities, given the situation. My heart aches for the pain caused and insecure feelings we have experienced over the past 24 hours here in Salt Lake City. We understand that this insecure feeling pales in comparison to the original reason for the protest. We reiterate our commitment to stamping out systemic racism. I love Salt Lake City, and the outpouring of support from our community has been staggering. Thank you so much.” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall also addressed the residents of Salt Lake City Sunday morning.",0.0

Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back. “I was just horrified by what I saw,“ Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.“ Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer — subsequently charged with murder — pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we’re seeing, I think it’s deeper than that as a culture that’s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That’s just my honest opinion. I think it’s really ... part of a culture where it’s deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days. Sefolosha — a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the Houston Rockets and formerly played for the Utah Jazz — considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha’s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha’s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders’ organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I’m really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, ‘OK, this is my duty as a human being,’ the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, ‘We are a clan, we stick together no matter what.’ It should be the other way around.“ The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida.

Some are calling for systemic change to prevent more deaths of black people at the hands of police. State Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, said protests are effective tools to bring awareness to issues, although she’s worried the violence on Saturday has diluted that message. Now, she said, it’s time to turn attention to making systemic change to avoid incidents like Floyd’s death. One way to do that is by registering to vote and electing politicians with an eye toward criminal justice reform, she said. Hollins said she’s been working on legislation to change how police officers interact with students in schools, like making sure behavioral issues don’t lead to arrests. “We need to continue to look at our policy around the school-to-prison pipeline, as a lot of people know that's part of my concern,” Hollins said. “What I have been working on is how do we make sure that our young people do not have contact with the police in the first place.” She is also calling on her fellow lawmakers to listen to Utahns about their experiences with law enforcement. “Last [Saturday] night was the result of people not feeling heard,” Hollins said. Gov. Gary Herbert activated up to 200 National Guardsmen to help with crowd control Saturday, and wrote on Twitter that “we condemn violence and looting.” In a press conference with Salt Lake City’s mayor and police chief Saturday evening, Herbert issued a strong rebuke of the events that were unfolding. “I think we need to call it what it is, criminal behavior,” Herbert said. “People are looking to riot, to loot and to create violence and that’s not acceptable.” We were deeply saddened to see the defacement of our beautiful Capitol building by this weekend’s protesters. We are heartened by the many individuals wanting to help clean its stone walls and grounds. — Gov. Gary Herbert (@GovHerbert) May 31, 2020 He added that he was “deeply saddened to see the defacement of our beautiful Capitol building by this weekend’s protestors.” Cleanup on the Capitol began Sunday morning. Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville, also condemned the violence. “What started as a peaceful protest to show unity for justice & good ended in violence & destruction,” Wilson wrote on Twitter. “Those that caused damage & inflicted violence on the media, our police officers & others do not represent the good people of Utah.” In response to the protest in Salt Lake City, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney thanked law enforcement for their response. “In a very challenging and volatile situation downtown yesterday, officers remained professional and patient,” Romney said in a statement. “Utah’s men and women in uniform put their lives on the line each and every day, and tragically we were just reminded of that with the loss of Officer Lyday in the line of duty. Let’s support them during this difficult time as they mourn one of their own.” Democratic Congressman Ben McAdams said violence is not the answer. “Peaceful protest has changed our country for the better,” he tweeted. “I support the right of anyone to demand change through peaceful protest. I do not support violence and destruction of property.” Utah’s ethnic and racial minority legislators released a joint statement Saturday, calling for change to the criminal justice system and urging protestors to demonstrate peacefully. “We have been working for decades to fight systemic racism. We are not backing down,” they said. “People are worn down. This pandemic has people physically and economically exhausted. They are outraged by the lingering injustice of another African-American man needlessly killed by police. We understand that people want to be heard. As legislators, we encourage people who choose to protest to stay safe, respect property, and respect social distancing.” Gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox came under fire for previous statements supporting President Donald Trump after he wrote a blog post calling for systemic change to law enforcement in order to prevent more deaths like George Floyd’s. “We must not recoil in surprise or disgust when those in the African American community march and protest and demand deeper systemic changes,” Cox wrote. “Instead, we must reach out and engage. We must listen to understand. And together we must act.” Utah House Minority Leader Rep. Brian King, D-Salt Lake City, said he appreciated Cox’s thoughts on the issue, but pointed out the “inconsistencies” of these comments and his support of President Trump. Cox has criticized the president for what he sees as divisive rhetoric, but said during a January gubernatorial debate that he supported him although he did not always agree with his style. “Is he a coward for not speaking out about words and actions of Donald Trump he surely knows are despicable?” King wrote on Twitter. “Or is he just politically expedient in a way that can be forgiven, overlooked, or justified? There are times in the past that he has crossed the conventional GOP line on issues in a way I admired. Like all of us, he can reasonably be seen as a jumble of inconsistencies.” King called on Cox, and all elected officials, to speak up when the President speaks and acts in a way that they agree with — and to speak up when he doesn’t. Cox’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on King’s remarks.",0.0

They’ve also proposed a civilian council to provide oversight of local law enforcement. But the group says they haven’t seen any action as a result.

She said they may consider ending it before it’s set to expire but they law enforcement and elected officials need to make sure they have Salt Lake City under control first. The National Guard remained on hand throughout the day to make sure the situation didn't escalate. Law enforcement made 41 arrests Saturday while 21 officers sought medical attention, mostly for heat exhaustion. The mayor thanked people who wanted to help clean up but cautioned them in doing so, saying that went against the point of the curfew. She said wait until city officials announced organized activities.

Multiple NBA players and their families have shared their feelings, reactions and messages via social media and have even taken part in protests against racial injustice. On Saturday, Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson was at a protest in Los Angeles and later shared photos on Twitter. “I witnessed a peaceful protest, a lot of emotion and unity,” he said. “The time for change has been passed due..don’t forget the message because of the tone that it is projected in!!” i witnessed a peaceful protest, alot of emotion and unity, the time for change has been passed due..dont forget the message because of the tone that it is projected in!! pic.twitter.com/a0SkOgiT5F — Jordan Clarkson (@JordanClarksons) May 31, 2020 Clarkson was one of many NBA players to attend protests across the country on Saturday, including the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Karl-Anthony Towns, the Philadelphia 76ers’ Tobias Harris and the Boston Celtics’ Jaylen Brown. Jazz and Stars point guard Nigel Williams-Goss shared a column written for Yahoo Sports by his mother, Dr. Valerie Williams-Goss. In the column Williams-Goss shares her experience as a white woman in a biracial marriage with biracial children. “Twenty-eight years ago, as a white woman getting married to an African-American former Air Force sergeant, I had no idea that I would have a front-seat window to the disparaging acts of racism that would plague his community on a daily basis,” she wrote. “Together we have watched countless murders of innocent black people, him with a lens of fear and anger. Me with a lens of hopelessness.” https://t.co/JU4OTXLzDa My mom, who has her PhD in Human Services (and is white) wrote this article today!

Plz share and RT — Nigel Williams-Goss (@NigelWG5) May 29, 2020 Jazz stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell both aired feelings of disgust and anger after video surfaced of Floyd, who later died, being detained by a police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly 10 minutes on Monday. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was taken into custody on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges Friday. Gobert retweeted the video of the incident saying, “If you let your coworker do that to another human being without trying to stop him or talk to him out of it, you are as guilty as he is. Frustrating for the majority of good cops that take a lot of risk doing their job the right way everyday.” On Wednesday Mitchell tweeted a photo of actor Will Smith with the quote “racism is not getting worse, it’s getting filmed,” a sentiment Smith shared on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert in 2016. Mitchell captioned the photo saying, “I woke up this morning and saw this! So true.” Mitchell, who has continued to share his thoughts on social media and retweet posts from others over the last few days, reacted on Saturday to video of a man who showed up to the Salt Lake City protest with a bow and arrow during a confrontation with protesters. “This is sick,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter. “Just the thought is sick... shooting bow and arrows at protesters.” I woke up and saw this!

This is what happens when elected officials, police departments, and “leaders” ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S. This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence. This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence. Mayor Mendenhall said that the events around the May 30 protest aren’t what justice looks like. We agree. This is what a demand looks like, a demand that can’t be ignored any longer. Justice would have been enacting real police reform, firing killer cops, addressing the systemic and constant racism. Justice would have been addressing the economic inequality, wage theft, exploitation, and poverty that plague every worker. Justice would have been listening to those of us who have been demanding changes for years. Bernardo, Cody, Patrick, Dillon, Harold, Elijah, and all the other people killed by Utah cops were still alive, or if their killers were in jail. Justice is when people like George Floyd no longer have to fear death at the hands of those who claim to “serve and protect.” It must be mentioned that protesters demanding an end to racism and police brutality were met with hundreds of cops and many acts of the very brutality that we are seeking to end. They were met with the National Guard. They were met with a curfew. They were met with dozens of arrests. With helicopters, rubber bullets, shields and batons, and the violent force of the very institution they want to reform. It must also be mentioned that UAPB brought the SLC government a comprehensive police reform proposal called the Salt Lake Civilian Police Accountability Council (SLCPAC). This would have created real community control of the police, an elected, civilian oversight body, that would have held killer cops accountable, that would have saved many lives. They quickly stopped working with us, and in 2019 Utah banned community control of the police outright. SLC supported that ban. Many other groups have also put forward reform proposals or policy suggestions to reign in the racist police violence we are protesting, to little effect. We have met with city councilors, city advisers and lawyers to discuss reform. We have gone to city council meetings. We have met with candidates for office. We have participated in the CAG. We have organized dozens of peaceful protests and gatherings, held community events, and tried to help our communities. We have lobbied at the Capitol. And in response we have seen no change. In fact, the Legislature has worked to ban reform and silence protesters at public meetings. All of this is why we organized a peaceful protest. And yet here we are, with several Utah police shootings in just the last week and many more acts of police brutality on May 30. We demand officials to finally listen to the people and do something. The time for community control of the police is now! Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown and Mayor Erin Mendenhall also released statements Sunday.

Cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City were among those who saw demonstrations trickle through their downtown areas. Tens of thousands of people peacefully protested. Rioting, looting and violence happened in these cities. There were also “police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers.

The black-haired Dutch shepherd worked his last shift on May 16, Cpl. Shawn Peterson, his partner and handler, told Cedar City News. “A couple of weeks before his retirement, we had a really good training day,” Peterson recalled, noting that the following day, he noticed Bolos had a slight limp and was favoring one of his legs. “We took him to the vet and she checked him out. We got to have a real tough conversation,” Peterson said. “Basically the way she put it out there was, you know, you can retire him now and then he’ll get a couple of good years to be a dog.” Since then, Bolos has transitioned into being a pet in the Peterson household. His first “human” meal after his retirement was a big, juicy beef steak, which he eagerly gobbled down, Peterson noted. Even though he seems to be enjoying his new free time, Bolos still misses going to work each day, Peterson said. “Every day, when I walk back from the kennel, he starts whining,” Peterson said. “He wants to go to work even though he physically can’t do it anymore. It’s hard.” “A stellar, stellar dog,” is how Peterson describes Bolos, who was 3 years old and already highly trained when he first joined the Iron County Sheriff’s Office, having come from a kennel in the Netherlands. Peterson said Bolos skillfully handled a wide range of assignments during his career, including conducting many drug searches and helping apprehend criminal suspects. He also participated in a number of search and rescues and made appearances at local schools and other demonstration events. Peterson said he and Bolos frequently worked in other jurisdictions, responding to calls throughout Southwest Utah – primarily in Iron County but also including nearby Beaver and Garfield counties and even as far as Beaver Dam, Arizona. At one point, Bolos was one of just two active K-9s working out of Iron County, Peterson said, adding that there are currently six working K-9 officers in the county, representing four different agencies. Peterson said of the many memories he has of working with Bolos, one that stands out is the time his K-9 partner helped save him from getting shot by a gunman. “I truly believe that I owe my life to him,” Peterson said of Bolos as he recounted a domestic violence call a few years ago where the suspect had established an advantageous position, reportedly planning to ambush and fire upon the responding officers. However, before any shots were fired, Bolos made his way around from the side and was able to successfully subdue the suspect. “He ended up surrendering. The guy just gave up,” Peterson said, noting that the man, like many other suspects, suddenly had a change in plans as soon he became aware of the K-9 officer’s presence. Whether he was sniffing through a room or vehicle to detect the presence of drugs or taking down a suspect, Bolos could always be counted on to perform his assigned tasks, Peterson said. “He knew his job and he did it well,” Peterson added. Since his partner’s retirement, Peterson has already started working with Bolos’ replacement, a 2-year-old American-born Belgian Malinois named Mattis, after the former secretary of defense. Soon, the word “Bolos” on the side door of Peterson’s ICSO patrol vehicle will say “Mattis” instead, as Peterson adjusts to training and working with his new partner. “So far, it’s going well,” Peterson said of the rigorous training required of all certified K-9s.

Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day.(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A leading anti-police brutality activist in Utah condemned the destruction of property that occurred during a protest Saturday night in Salt Lake City. But he said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like George Floyd who are killed by police. “As Martin Luther King said, the riot is the language of the unheard. Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Forty-one people were arrested in Salt Lake City during volatile protests that led to one police car being burned, one officer being seriously injured and the implementation of a curfew, Salt Lake City police said Sunday morning as crews cleaned up streets and scrubbed graffiti from buildings including the state Capitol. Scott attributed the destruction to “shameful, disgusting and lazy activists” who are not members of her group that bans violence and has been diligently working with police to create reform. Her group didn’t organize any part of the Salt Lake City protest, she said, but supports the underlying cause behind the demonstrations going on around the country. Most people peacefully marched, chanted or blew their car horns on Saturday. But some protesters turned to violence and vandalism, setting two cars on fire and attacking police officers, who responded with tear gas. Men carrying rifles stood on top of the wreckage of a burned police car. What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station in Salt Lake City. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Floyd, a black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. A group called Utah Against Police Brutality, which organized the car caravan part of the protest, said in a statement Sunday on Facebook that demonstrations reflect “what happens when elected officials, police departments, and leaders ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S.” “This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence,” the group said. “This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence.” Most of the people were arrested for failure to disperse, while a few were booked on suspicion of breaking a curfew and assault on a police officer, said Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown during a briefing with reporters. He said his agency was working to get more details about the people arrested, including where they live because he believes people from outside Utah came to instigate the violence. A total of 21 police officers received medical care, and one police officer was hit in the back of the head with a bat, Brown said. He said his agency has also identified a man who aimed a bow and arrow at a group of protesters before he was tackled and his car burned and that the incident is being investigated. Brown said the man was pulled from the crowd for his safety because officers saw he was being attacked and didn’t learn until later that he had aimed a bow and arrow at protesters. He and Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police. “That was troubling. That was a horrible situation,” Brown said. Brown said his agency has also opened an internal investigation of an officer shown on video pushing an older man to the ground. Mendenhall enacted the curfew — which lasts until 6 a.m. Monday — and Gov. Gary Herbert activated the Utah National Guard after thousands converged on the downtown area Saturday afternoon. The extent and cost of the damage was still being assessed on Sunday, Mendenhall said. The Democratic former city councilwoman who is in her first year as mayor said the protests illustrate deeper societal issues that must be addressed. “We will recover,” Mendenhall said, “and we will recover coming together to rebuild policies and to address, unearth, unpack the systemic racism that exists in this city and in every city across this nation.” Mendenhall and Brown said they will look into any complaints about how officers handled the situation, but called for an end to violence and destruction. “We cannot have meaningful conversations in a riotous situation,” Brown said.",0.0

Granite columns and pedestals, originally from 1914 were vandalized along with stones on the Capitol as well. Professional cleaners could be seen working on the restoration of the area. Allyson Gamble with the capitol preservation board said, “utahns are wonderful. When something bad happens, we fix it. And the vendors that you see, the people that you see, are here volunteering.

But she also acknowledged the bigger issue of police accountability here and nationally and the reason behind the initial peaceful protests Saturday afternoon — to highlight police brutality in such incidences as the death last week of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Mendenhall noted before the riots started, talks were already underway with members of the community on how to make the police department more transparent. “We are united in our work, and we acknowledge we can always do better as a city and as a police department,” Mendenhall said. Just hours after violent protests around the Salt Lake Main Library ended, the mayor and Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown assessed the events at an 8 a.m. news conference. Twenty-one officers were treated for medical issues from Saturday’s protests, Brown said, the most common heat exhaustion. One officer was hit in the back of his head with a baseball bat. If not for the helmet he was wearing, Brown said, that officer could have suffered critical injuries or even been killed. Police arrested 46 people, most of them for failing to disperse. Some were arrested for assaulting police officers and others for curfew violations. The chief said he suspected that many of those arrested are not from the area. “I honestly believe there were people from out of state who were here to instigate violence,” Brown said. The arrested The Deseret News reviewed 40 police affidavits of those booked into either the Salt Lake County or Davis County jails after being arrested during the protests. Nearly every person arrested was for failing to disperse. Others had additional arrest charges for disorderly conduct, violating curfew and drug possession. Among those arrested for investigation of failure to disperse are: Adam Arkeem Demond Ervin, 24; Gabriella Megan Gourdin, 24; Marcos Jose Castillo, 21; Aimee Kim Nguyen, 24; Morgan K. Facemyer, 18; Erin Leigh Berdahl, 19; Vanessa Robyn Jeppesen, 22; Mercedes McKinley, 31; Leonardo Raul Gaytan Morales, 21; Annika Dowsakul Bouttavong, 22; Evangelina Gonzalez, 22; Hannah Lillie Wilson, 21; Odette Baumeister, 18; Jordan Kevin Turner, 29; Melissa Renae Brainerd, 27; Bradley David Hagen, 40; Rebecca Rodriguez, 28; Jarod Donovan Hartlerode, 30; Kiesh Easterwood, 25; Justin Dean Kramer, 36; Riley Westergard, 21; Ian Eaton, 20; Scott Mark Larson, 33; Hobie Jeffery Simon, 39; Lance Chadrick Delano Kaufusi, 18; Jacob Daniel Corbaley, 24; Stephen Henry Sprague, 26; Patrick Edward Mac, 36; Thien Nhut Vu, 38; Nacom Abdoul Koffi, 49; Carlos Daniel Vastellanos, 18; James G. Hawthorne 70; Perry Bryant Bates, 33; Adam Gethin Fuller, 24; and Robert Adam Hubbert, 24. In addition to failing to disperse, Zachary Julius, 24, was also arrested for investigation of drug possession. Ashley Anne Sims, 30, was arrested at the state Capitol for investigation of failing to disperse and assaulting an officer. Utah Highway Patrol troopers gave the crowd gathered on the Capitol grounds 90 minutes to disperse, according to a police affidavit. “Some of the protesters remained at the scene, well after the warning had been issued. Ashley Anne Sims was one that failed to disperse. In the process of arrest, Sims kicked a sergeant with Utah Highway Patrol, in the groin,” the affidavit states. Sims also was in possession of a can of spray paint at the time of her arrest, police say. Emilie Marie Smith, 22, and Lauren Elizabeth Hambrick, 24, were arrested for investigation of criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for allegedly throwing rocks through the window of the Matheson Courthouse, 450 S. State. “The result of (their) actions caused the window to break causing a spider web effect,” according to a police affidavit. “The cost to replace the window is estimated at approximately $10,000.” Shane Brooks, 30, was arrested for investigation of failing to disperse, violating curfew and disorderly conduct. Brooks was in the area of 400 South and 200 East and “failed to disperse at the command of police while actively protesting and rioting,” according to a police affidavit. Information about the other six who were arrested was not available. Those arrested for investigation of failing to disperse ranged in age from 18 to 70, with most in their mid-20s. Those arrested live in cities such as Salt Lake City, Sandy, West Valley City, West Jordan and Layton, according to court records. While most of those arrested have minor criminal histories in Utah, court records state, some people have no prior criminal history or even a traffic ticket in Utah. It was not immediately known Sunday whether those people live in the state. Salt Lake police said some people were booked into the Davis County Jail to avoid overcrowding at the Salt Lake County Jail, which also helped in addressing COVID-19 concerns. At least two police vehicles were damaged during the protest, including a Salt Lake police patrol car that was flipped over and destroyed by fire. Sunday afternoon, police were asking for the public’s help to identify three men that detectives wanted to question who were captured in photos and video. “We would like to speak with them regarding the flipping, vandalism, and burning of a Salt Lake City Police car. If you know who they are, please call 801-799-3000,” police tweeted. Man with a weapon Both Brown and Mendenhall were also asked about a confrontation between a man with a bow and arrow and protesters on Saturday. According to witnesses, a man armed with a bow and arrow, and also possibly a knife, drove his SUV up to demonstrators and threatened them. Protesters immediately attacked the man, leaving him with a bloody face, and then flipped his vehicle over once he was out, and set it on fire. The man was seen being led away by police in handcuffs, but later reappeared after being released, and got into another verbal confrontation with protesters. Brown called the incident a “troubling” situation and a “priority investigation.” Although the man was not booked into jail, police say they know his name and charges will be screened against him. Mendenhall asked Sunday for anyone who witnessed the confrontation involving the bow and arrow to contact police. The Deseret News has confirmed the identity of the man whose car was burned as a 62-year-old Taylorsville resident. The same man was charged with assault in Taylorsville Justice Court on May 7 in a suspected road rage incident, according to police. In that case, the man was angry that another vehicle pulling a trailer near 6200 South and 4000 West was allegedly driving too slow, said Unified Police Sgt. Melody Gray. The man claimed he was then cut off, which somehow resulted in a fist fight between the two drivers, she said. The man left the scene before police arrived but was found at his home a short time later and cited. The Taylorsville man also has a criminal history in California, according to public records. Still figuring the toll Numerous glass panes were broken at TRAX platforms, and many buildings — including the state Capitol and the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building — were tagged with graffiti. Mendenhall said city officials were still counting how many buildings were damaged Sunday. But she noted that windows can be replaced. “We will clean up. We will repair,” she said. And while the mayor is grateful for the spirit of volunteerism she is seeing as people have asked to come downtown Sunday to help with cleanup efforts, Mendenhall wants everyone to obey the curfew that runs until 6 a.m. Monday. “The trash and spray paint are not going anywhere,” she said. At the Capitol, a few dozen volunteers had been working to scrub off graffiti since 8 a.m., said Allyson Gamble, Capitol Preservation Board executive director. Most of the vandalism involved graffiti, paint and litter around the grounds, she said, expressing gratitude that more serious damage wasn’t done. Open for review The mayor has asked Brown to give her a “thorough after-action review” of how officers handled Saturday’s riot, and she asked any citizen who felt they weren’t treated well by police to file a complaint so the Citizen Review Board could look at any inappropriate use of force. “We welcome the criticism and critique in a positive fashion,” Brown said, adding that he would like to have critical and positive conversations with the public. Brown specifically addressed an incident caught on video of a Salt Lake police officer dressed in riot gear shoving an elderly man with a cane to the ground as the man slowly tried to move away from the scene. A couple of other officers quickly went to the man to help him back to his feet. “I have seen the video and it was inappropriate,” the chief said. “This is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD. My expectations are that if people are exercising their First Amendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully.” Brown said “it was hard for me to watched what happened” and he has since reached out to the man and personally apologized. The officer who shoved the elderly man has been identified, but his name was not released. The chief said an internal investigation is underway. While it was unclear Sunday whether that officer is on administrative leave or just reassigned, police confirmed he had been taken off crowd control duty. Mendenhall later commended the chief in a tweet for taking action. “While @slcpd yesterday largely showed great restraint and patience, I am grateful to Chief Brown for responding swiftly to address the incident with the older gentleman with a cane.” Advocacy groups speak out Jacarri Kelley, leader of Northern Utah Black Lives Matter, said Sunday she was disappointed in the direction the protest took. “I should be comfortable enough to take my child to a legal protest, but when people are angry or hurt or don’t have a way to vent their frustrations, that’s when they do what they did yesterday. I don’t condone rioting or looting. I understand people are hurt, but here in Utah, that’s not the answer. We have so many other ways people can help us out,” Kelley said. Kelley doesn’t know how the demonstration got out of hand, but believes other groups, including white nationalists and supremacists, joined in potentially to take the spotlight off the intended message of the planned protest. She said instead of rioting, it’s more helpful for those who want to help the cause by volunteering with groups like Black Lives Matter and Utah Against Police Brutality. “I want to see all those young people out there letting their voices be heard with their right to vote. A lot of people don’t have that right, but because they do because they’re fresh and young, they should exercise their right to vote for those who can’t,” Kelley said. Utahns against Police Brutality also issued a statement. “This is what happens when elected officials, police departments, and ‘leaders’ ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S. This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence,” it said in part. “This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence. “Mayor Mendenhall said that the events around the May 30 protest aren’t what justice looks like. We agree. This is what a demand looks like, a demand that can’t be ignored any longer. Justice would have been enacting real police reform, firing killer cops, addressing the systemic and constant racism. Justice would have been addressing the economic inequality, wage theft, exploitation and poverty that plague every worker. Justice would have been listening to those of us who have been demanding changes for years.” Praise for coordinated efforts Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson issued a statement Sunday praising city officials for how they handled the protests and riots, while also committing to continue working with the Unified Police Department and Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera to “focus on de-escalation and employees receive robust training on racial bias.” “I am proud that Salt Lake City’s officers and those who assisted last night showed restraint, and that while property damage is extensive there seems to be limited personal injury due to the riot,” Wilson said. Brown thanked the numerous Wasatch Front police agencies and Air and Army National Guard units for assisting his department Saturday. The chief said his officers were “exhausted.” And despite having everything from rocks and bricks to water bottles and even water-valve covers thrown at them, the officers are not discouraged from doing their jobs. “It’s what they do,” he said. “They signed on to do this job. It’s in their DNA. They are here to serve and protect.”",0.0

One of the officers involved in the incident, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Protests erupted across major U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Smaller cities like Salt Lake City saw protests as well. The National Guard was activated in states like Minnesota, Georgia, Washington. Cities similarly enacted late night curfews, too.

As the day wore on, protesters vandalized stores, burned vehicles and threw objects; by the end of the day, protesters and officers were injured and many protesters were in police custody. After a citywide curfew went into effect, law enforcement officers from across northern Utah gathered near the Salt Lake City Library, armed with shields and batons, formed lines across from the protesters and began moving forward to disperse crowds. Rows of police officers advanced south on 200 East toward protesters about 10 p.m., firing rubber bullets to try to disperse those remaining few who were hurling objects toward police. By 10:45 p.m. most of the crowds had been dispersed, and officers were loading the last few detainees onto a Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office bus. All this, hours after state and city leaders ordered an emergency curfew for the city which began at 8 p.m. and will last until Monday at 6 a.m. Gov. Gary Herbert also tweeted that he “activated the National Guard to help control the escalating situation in downtown Salt Lake City. I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Many of those downtown Saturday were mourning something. Some of the responding officers came from the Ogden Police Department days after mourning one of their own killed in the line of duty. Similarly, the original stated purpose of the protest was for those mourning the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Downtown after curfew A tense, chaotic scene unfolded as police officers walked forward, announcing “This is an unlawful assembly, go home!” with loudspeakers. Stacked lines of police officers advanced, shoulder to shoulder, carrying shields, batons and rubber bullet guns, with armored vehicles behind them. As officers moved forward, motorcycles revved, people chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and some protesters threw items. Protesters threw glass bottles, weapons and signs, but while officers continued to quickly advance intermittently, they refrained from rushing the crowd. There were reports that one officer suffered a broken arm, and Salt Lake Police Chief Mike Brown said another officer was attacked by a baseball bat and suffered head injuries. Several protesters were also hurt, many by people throwing rocks, bottles and other items. Later, rocks were thrown over a reporter's head and rubber bullets were fired into the crowd. “Stop shooting! Stop shooting! You shot me in the face!” a protester screamed behind the reporter. As the numbers were being reduced, there were scattered “pops” and smoke bombs. “Leave the area, go home, quit throwing things, it’s not safe, it’s not a peaceful protest. You have been given a lawful command to disperse,” officers announced. Utah Highway Patrol Col. Michael Rapich told KSL that “the dispersal order was continually repeated for one hour” in multiple languages before officers began taking the remaining protesters into custody. Most dispersed at that point, he said, but “there were a few that chose not to; they were taken into custody without incident.” He said officers would enforce the curfew Salt Lake City has put in place until 6 a.m. Monday. “Hopefully that curfew gives everyone a pause” before continuing acts of vandalism, he said, adding the First Amendment is what Utah is about, but the platform of damaging state property is not what Utah is about. Protests take a turn The peaceful protests took a turn about 3 p.m. Saturday afternoon at the corner of 200 East and 400 South when people overturned a police car and set it on fire. The vehicle's windows were shattered, and before the fire was set, some members of the crowd were standing on top of the car dancing and waving signs; others in the crowd denounced such actions.

Police in riot gear got out and started yelling at protesters to leave. As of 6:30 p.m., the National Guard had arrived on scene. It was unclear at that point who on the scene of the protest was related to the original protest and who had come in from outside groups. From then on, the action came in waves, with some protesters throwing objects at police lines, injuring a few officers. Some protesters appeared to be injured in the scuffles as well, and at least a couple of people were taken into custody. Another car was set on fire later in the evening and a man taken into police custody after witnesses say he showed a knife and a bow and arrow in the midst of a group of protesters. A witness said the man drove up near a crowd of protesters at 200 East and 400 South. The witness said the man got out of the vehicle with a large knife attached to his side and pulled out a bow and arrow and attempted to shoot someone. KSL TV cameras were rolling as protesters tackled the man to the ground. Police officers in the area pulled the man from the crowd and took him into custody. Shortly thereafter, a black vehicle which some witnesses said belonged to the man with the bow and arrow was flipped over by protesters and lit on fire. The area was crowded with protesters and armored police officers attempting to keep the crowds away from the burning vehicle.

Morning protests Utah organizers planned events Saturday with the intent to peacefully honor George Floyd's death. The black Minnesota man died in police custody after white police officer kneeled on his neck earlier this week. The morning event was intended to be an in-car protest only, organized by Utah Against Police Brutality. Protesters were asked to drive by in their vehicles and honk at the public safety building as they circled the block. Hundreds of protesters on foot circled the Salt Lake City Library several times before filling the sidewalks in front of the Salt Lake City Police Department public safety building, holding signs reading ""Justice for George,"" ""White Silence"" and ""Stop Police Brutality.""

(Photo: Katie Workman, KSL.com) Aaron Campbell, a man who said he has experience with protests, said he came out to help keep people safe. He said he attempted to organize on-foot protesters in groups of 20 to obey social distancing requirements, but they were ""swarmed by a large group of about a hundred."" Protesters with loudspeakers led chants such as: ""This is what democracy looks like!"" ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""I can't breathe."" Protesters cheered and raised signs amid the ruckus, still backed by constant honking and the revving of motorcycles. As chants continued, two protesters scaled the entryway of the precinct and spray painted the building with the words ""George Floyd,"" ""(expletive) da police"" and ""Enough is Enough,"" among other things. Passing cars honked in support, and many of their windows were painted with protest slogans or posters. Egg shells and food remained littered the steps after the protesters left, and tomatoes and empty egg cartons were discovered nearby.

(Photo: Katie Workman, KSL.com) Campbell said a man on a Harley Davidson motorcycle helped break up the protest in front of the police building when he slowly drove through the crowd and encouraged organizers to continue walking. Many obeyed the suggestion and much of the crowd dispersed, though smaller groups remained on street corners and in front of the building. Construction signs, local bus stations and the Utah Transit Authority's Library Station were also vandalized. Capitol protesters Protests continued in the early afternoon at the Utah State Capitol Building, where hundreds gathered on the steps and peaceful continued chants. Some protesters passed out water and others scaled light posts. A rainbow LGBTQ+ pride flag billowed in the wind in front of the building, and passing motorcyclists continued to rev their engines to cheers. Additional graffiti reading ""Blue lives murder"" and ""No justice, no peace,"" among others, covered areas of the steps and grounds. Graffiti was also found on the Capitol's front windows, much of it painted in red. Protest signs were also taped to the windows. Hundreds knelt on the front steps with fists in the air in tribute of George Floyd, and a protester with a loudspeaker gave a brief speech denouncing police brutality and encouraging protesters to remain active because ""showing up is not enough"" to end injustice. In the evening, officers lined up at the Capitol steps, preventing protesters from entering the building. The message law enforcement tried to communicate was that everyone has the right to gather and protest, but they were there to make sure the situation didn't turn violent. About an hour after curfew, Utah Highway Patrol troopers were ready to enforce the curfew at the Capitol, and most protesters were leaving. Troopers were heard on loudspeakers telling the roughly two-dozen remaining protesters to disperse and were advancing their line to encourage protesters to leave. As of 10 p.m., at least two people had somehow made their way inside the Capitol and were peering out through a window. UHP is tasked with protecting the Utah State Capitol building, which was vandalized, but no one illegally breached the Capitol, Rapich said. And damage at the Capitol would be repaired quickly, he said. “Our Capitol is a symbol of our entire state.” Local NAACP reaction In comments to KSL Saturday night, Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Salt Lake Branch, said the organization does not condone the destruction that has happened during the protests in Salt Lake City. “We do realize the frustration that people have been feeling but the violence in the protests is not something we want to see,” Williams said. “There’s better ways to do it than to do the type of violence that we’ve been seeing. ... This protest is not a badge of honor whatsoever. We want folks to not fuel tension.” The NAACP does not condone protesters hitting and throwing objects at officers or anyone else, or vandalism, she said. “Those are things we are very disheartened about,” Williams said. “It does a discredit to the work that we’ve done as a nonprofit civil rights organization” and she invited people to join their cause to “do some good but not do the violence.” Contributing: Jacob Klopfenstein, KSL.com; Mike Headrick and Shara Park, KSL TV × Photos Related Stories",0.0

The restrictions prohibit anyone from being on a public street or property, including for the purpose of travel, in Salt Lake City during the curfew hours. Exceptions include: Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel News media People traveling directly to and from work People traveling directly to and from the Salt Lake City International Airport People traveling directly to obtain food People seeking medical care or fleeing dangerous circumstances People caring for a family member, friend or animal People attending church services and patrionizing private businesses People experiencing homelessness Private businesses may remain open, but people may not be out on the streets or in public places for any reason other than those listed above, according to a tweet from Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. In response to the violence and destruction of property in Salt Lake City today, I have issued a curfew that will apply to all of #SLC extending from 8 p.m. tonight until 6 a.m. Monday morning. #utpol — SLC Mayor Erin Mendenhall (@slcmayor) May 31, 2020 An emergency alert was sent just after 9 p.m. reminding Utahns of the curfew. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said officers have been driving around downtown announcing the curfew and will now start making arrests. So far, there have been six arrests from Saturday's protests. ""Unfortunately, what I have seen in the past few hours has gone from a peaceful protest to criminal behavior,"" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in an evening press briefing. ""Make no mistake that we will do whatever necessary to restore order to our state, our capital city Salt Lake."" Related: 2nd car set on fire, man taken into custody amid Salt Lake City protests Another car has been set on fire, and a man taken into custody after witnesses say he pulled out a knife and crossbow in the midst of protests in downtown Salt Lake City. Mendenhall said the intention of today was to give protestors the space to exercise their legal right to protest in response to the death of George Floyd. The demonstration turned dangerous as two cars were set on fire in downtown Salt Lake City. ""As a city, we have been through a lot together,"" Mendenhall said. ""I'm angry and I'm heartbroken with you."" Herbert tweeted that he had activated the National Guard to help control the escalating situation in downtown Salt Lake City. ""I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully,” he said. The state of Utah has requested the assistance of up to 200 National Guardsmen, according to Brown. The police chief said 13 Utah cities have provided aid in the unified effort to respond to the protesters. About one hour into the curfew, KSL TV talked with Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera, who said she is “willing to come to the table” and talk with whomever wants to talk about necessary reform. “Let’s get together at the table and let’s make the changes,” she said, but for now, she encouraged protesters to go home. “We’re trying to keep the peace,” she said, adding that she is also a person of color and wants to see change, too. She added that reform is necessary, but changes in culture are also important, including hiring a more diverse police force, which she is trying to do. She emphasized that it’s important for officers to communicate as well as to listen. Shortly after the interview, police continued pushing forward on their line and several protesters began heading away from the scene. Brown and Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson tweeted a video announcing the details of the curfew Saturday night. ""Please, we ask, help us out during this most difficult time, stay home and obey this curfew,"" Brown said. ""Whatever you do tonight, please help us to keep Utah safe,"" Anderson added. × Related Stories",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. What started as a peaceful demonstration later turned destructive, with people flipping a police car and lighting it on fire. A second car was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. A woman protesting the death of George Floyd stands in front of a line of police along Las Vegas Boulevard, Friday, May 29, 2020, in Las Vegas.

We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the unrest dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S. × Photos Related Stories",0.0

City and state officials had deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems, but that did little to stop many cities from again erupting into unrest. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while masked crowds broke into upscale stores in a San Francisco suburb, fleeing with bags of merchandise. In Minneapolis, a truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after George Floyd died after pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests since Floyd’s death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from looting and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, a leading anti-police brutality activist condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” For a second day, the protests reached to the White House, where chants could be heard from around 1,000 demonstrators just across the street in Lafayette Park as they faced police in riot gear behind barricades. The scene was defiant but peaceful, though police used flash bangs to stop another group from reaching the park. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Yet thousands still marched peacefully, with some also calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said earlier that he had asked Ellison, who is black, to help. Freeman, who is white, has been criticized by civil rights activists and some city officials, who say there is a history of mistrust between his office and members of the community. Walz told reporters that Ellison “needs to lead this case.” He said he made the decision after speaking with Floyd’s family who “wanted to believe that there was a trust, and they wanted to believe that the facts would be heard.” Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. The immense deployment there appeared to have worked Saturday night, when there was comparatively little destruction. On Sunday, in a display of force, long lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers were lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger.

1621907950,2020-06-01 00:00:00,Minneapolis burning: A protester says he can’t remain silent,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/5/31/21273765/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-police-pandemic-covid-breonna-black-white,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"“People of the Pandemic” is a series exploring the COVID-19 experience through brief, vivid interludes in the lives of interesting people across spectrums of class, occupation, age, ethnicity and geography — sketches of our world’s new temporary normal. SALT LAKE CITY — His bushy black beard resists a white mask, his dark eyes shaded by a N.Y. Yankees cap, as he walks through Minneapolis to the spot where George Floyd fell limp under a police officer’s knee. He’s not sure what to expect. Sadness, a decrepit chunk of asphalt. Instead he finds a monument of bouquets and balloons and portraits and signs that reminds him why he needs to be here. Angelo Pinto came to protest. While America fights a virus that makes it hard to breathe, a 46-year-old black man was killed under the knee of a white police officer after saying repeatedly, “I can’t breathe” and “I’m about to die,” COVID-19 can’t change that. The dead man’s words echo up and down the block. Women hand out water and food. Some locals give speeches. Others chant: “I can’t breathe.” But some cough or sneeze, or speak a little too passionately for Angelo’s comfort, so he keeps his distance. For now, that isn’t too hard. But things will look different by nightfall. When the pandemic began, Angelo quarantined at home on Long Island. For two months, he emerged only for essentials like groceries. Sometimes he’d play basketball in the backyard with his 8-year-old daughter, or tend to the corn and tomatoes in their garden, pondering what crop to add next. But that changed after images hit social media of New York police arresting and even striking people of color over social distancing violations, and handing out masks to white people. As a longtime organizer, he couldn’t stay home. So on May 11, he marched to NYPD headquarters wearing a mask and using caution tape to stay 6 feet from the nearest person. He still had no symptoms two weeks later, when he heard about Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who died after being shot by police officers executing a drug warrant on a different person in mid-March. Again, Angelo couldn’t stay home. He flew to Louisville, Kentucky, with three fellow activists and helped arrange a memorial outside Breonna’s apartment. That’s where he heard about Floyd. Floyd was being arrested Monday on suspicion of passing a fake $20 bill. Cellphone video captured him struggling for air, still handcuffed, as a white officer pressed Floyd’s neck to the pavement for nearly nine minutes, with observers begging him to stop. Floyd was pronounced dead at the hospital. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was later charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. So Angelo’s group rented a car and drove to Minnesota, arriving Wednesday morning. The memorial feels sacred, so Angelo helps build a barrier of cones and wire to protect it. He’s encouraged by what he sees, “people treating each other gently and honoring each other.” Throughout the day, the rallying cry — “I can’t breathe” — reminds him what he’s risking. The pandemic has disproportionately affected black communities in America, but so have police-involved shootings. Could solidarity over one danger create more risks for the other? By nightfall, it doesn’t matter. Angelo is on the streets, in a crowd. The city is ready to ignite. “You have a tremendous amount of anger and aggression that needs a place to go,” Angelo says, and he doesn’t see a release valve. Fires rage, incinerating a Wendy’s and an AutoZone. Police in riot gear exchange rubber bullets, flash grenades and tear gas with protesters tossing rocks and water bottles. “This all makes sense,” Angelo thinks, like the Boston Tea Party from his daughter’s history lessons. When the government doesn’t represent its citizens, he reasons, they let the government know. And they’ll keep going, each night bringing new escalations — including a police precinct set ablaze. In a protest, the crowd becomes a singular organism, shouting and marching and breathing as one. Only about half of the people are wearing masks, and Angelo makes a note to round up more. But he says the point is to stand together, close enough to swap sweat. Staring into a crowd of black and “a lot of white folks, actually,” he can’t be afraid. He’ll do what he can to stay safe, but he won’t stay silent.",0.0
1621937811,2020-06-01 00:31:55,More than 100 march in Cedar City to protest George Floyd’s death,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2020/05/31/jmr-more-than-100-march-in-cedar-city-to-protest-george-floyds-death/,en,False,,70917,stgeorgeutah.com,http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/#spider,"CEDAR CITY — More than 100 people gathered and marched in downtown Cedar City Sunday afternoon to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis on Memorial Day and to advocate for positive change. During the two-hour event, participants walked through downtown streets, including a few blocks up and down Main Street, waving signs with phrases like “Black Lives Matter” and shouting chants such as “no justice, no peace” and “say his name: George Floyd.” Another oft-repeated chant was “I can’t breathe,” a phrase uttered repeatedly by Floyd during his final minutes as arresting police officers held him down, including one who applied his knee to his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds according to a video taken by a bystander. Twice during their march on Sunday, the crowd of protesters in Cedar City knelt in silence for that same span of time. “The man could not breathe,” said event organizer Sage Ducote, a recent graduate of Southern Utah University, in reference to Floyd’s death. “That is horrible, and that can’t be allowed to happen, especially when other police officers are standing there watching.” Ducote said he spearheaded Cedar City’s event, along with the help of David Nguyen and a few other close friends after seeing other protests in recent days take a violent turn. “Obviously, you see what’s going on in cities around the country, and I think it’s bringing a really negative narrative to the message that’s trying to be conveyed,” Ducote said. “I don’t think the barbarism that’s taking place is an acceptable way to convey the message, and I don’t want it to invalidate the message.” “I wanted to just have people gather today, make sure everyone knows it’s peaceful, make sure the police know it’ll be peaceful,” he added. “We did that and it was successful.” Most of the honking and waving from passing drivers appeared to be supportive in nature, save for a couple of pickup trucks that kept driving by loudly, as if to disrupt the procession. “I don’t think it could have gone better,” Ducote said at the event’s conclusion. “I mean, yesterday when I was trying to plan it, I had maybe four or five people tell me for sure they would come. And then this morning, it just started blowing up.” Thanks to some timely social media posts, several dozen people showed up for the event, which started just after 3 p.m. Between 120 and 150 people were estimated to have participated in at least part of the march. Along the way, officers from multiple local law enforcement agencies were on hand to help direct traffic and make sure the marchers could get across the streets safely. “The protest went off without a hitch,” Iron County Commissioner Mike Bleak wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “I appreciated the people involved for exercising their First Amendment right, and doing it peacefully.” Bleak, also a sworn police officer who wore his Cedar City Police Department uniform during the event, went on to thank the various agencies who coordinated and helped ensure the event went smoothly. SUU President Scott Wyatt, who was asked by Ducote to say a few words at the beginning of the march, expressed his appreciation to those in attendance. “George Floyd was not the first person who died from hate and racism, but one day we’re going to be able to say who the last person was, because we have a hope that this will end,” Wyatt told the crowd. Continued Wyatt: The core of a university is free speech, public expression, the right to peaceful protest and assembly. And indeed, all good things have happened as a result of people asking questions and demanding answers. Martin Luther King said it best when he said, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that.’ And as we show love, we can overcome all the hate in the world. Someday. We just have to keep pushing. Schvalla Rivera, SUU’s assistant to the president for diversity and inclusion, also expressed her appreciation, saying she was also honored to be part of the event. “I was very proud of our students, faculty, staff, and community, community members who came out today,” she said. “It was beautiful to be a part of it. I was so happy that students and alumni got together to help organize people in town and on campus. It’s very meaningful, especially in Utah and places where the minority populations are so small, that people get together and support each other. I think that it goes a long way to help make things better. Silence is not helpful. So it’s very important that everyone who believes in what’s right, stand up.” “Martin Luther King said it’s always the right time to do the right thing,” Rivera added. “And I think that that’s what we should do. It’s always the right time. It’s not always going to be comfortable. It’s not always going to be convenient, but when something’s the right thing to do and we’re acting in love, it’s always the right time to do it.” Rivera said one of the key aspects of racism is a “loss of humanity, when people aren’t able to see or value the lives of other people.” “A lot of times people don’t understand that there’s so many repercussions to racism,” she said. “And so, when we are able to gather and recognize and see the humanity in each other and value each other, that’s what’s going to help change things.” Rivera said she hopes Sunday’s march is not just a one-time event. “I hope that this sparks conversations and more understanding and community involvement,” she said, adding, “Get out and vote. I don’t care what party you vote, but, you know, get people in office who are going to work for your community.” Click on photo to enlarge it, then use your left-right arrow keys to cycle through the gallery.

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.""

""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers.""

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning.

Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said.

Speaking to NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, Beatty said she understands the sentiment that attempting to have a ""healthy dialogue"" about race hasn't worked, but that ""violence doesn't work — violence either way."" ""We have to somehow make sure that we get the word out that you cannot come in and tear up buildings,"" Beatty said. ""When you break windows and destroy businesses and people get hurt, that's not going to resolve the problem of why George Floyd died."" Asked about the mobilizing of National Guard units in response to protests, Beatty said she knows they can be called in with ""clear"" instructions to ""protect the buildings"" and not ""incite or engage in rioting."" Beatty was pepper-sprayed while at a demonstration in Columbus — one of the numerous protests Saturday over Floyd's death last week while in the custody of Minneapolis police. The congresswoman said the event started out peacefully, but that something apparently ""went awry"" in just seconds. She said events took a turn after an altercation between a young woman and a police officer. ""I found myself saying, 'No this is wrong. Let's not excite the crowd.' Because it was almost over and it had sent a strong message,"" Beatty said. Photos posted to Twitter appeared to show parts of the confrontation.

""I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some..individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation,"" Hardin tweeted Saturday.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: We're following the unrest this weekend in cities across the country, and we'll go now to Columbus, Ohio, where Representative Joyce Beatty is. Congresswoman, good morning. JOYCE BEATTY: Good morning. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You marched yesterday, and you were pepper sprayed. Can you tell us what happened? BEATTY: Well, I participated in the march yesterday because I thought it was important for me to stand in solidarity with the peaceful protesters who were standing up against the injustices that we all have been feeling not just for the last seven, eight hours. But it has certainly been a collection of emotion. And I can tell you for the first hour and a half or 40 minutes of a two-hour protest, it was very peaceful. But it appeared that something went awry in just seconds. And it started with whatever the - after police were deployed. They're not sure why. But when one gentleman - there was some type of altercation. And you know how it goes. When one person is flipped over on the ground and you're standing there on the edge, people start pushing and shoving. And as one young lady had an altercation with the police, you know, I found myself saying no, this is wrong. Let's not excite the crowd because it was almost over. And it had sent a strong message. But after that, for some reason, pepper spray was pulled out in the face of a young sister next to me. And you know as pepper goes - or now at least I know, it doesn't have any direction after its release. So it was not a direct spray. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Representative, I have to ask you - NPR's reported that military police were planning to deploy from places like Fort Bragg and Fort Drum. Do you have any concerns about using the U.S. armed forces right now considering some of the scenes we've seen with the reaction by the police? BEATTY: I think we have to - I think it's twofold and maybe even a parallel track. I think we have to protect our communities. I don't think that destruction is helpful. I think it's a distraction to the message. And so unfortunately, when buildings and businesses, hard-working Americans' businesses are being burnt up, there is a historic outreach to call in the National Guard. But I also know you can call in the National Guard with clear instructions that you are there to protect the buildings and not to excite and engage in rioting because that's not going to help anything. And history has taught us that. So I think we have to figure out how we all come together and have a healthy dialogue. And I know that sounds like we've done that before and it doesn't work, but violence doesn't work. Violence either way. That's what got us into this, injustices. So we have to somehow make sure that we get the word out that you cannot come in and tear up buildings. They're just buildings. But when you break windows and destroy businesses and people get hurt, that's not going to resolve the problem of why George Floyd died. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's... BEATTY: And that was another reason I wanted to be there to be that voice and to stand with so many of those individuals who were there and who did the right thing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Joyce Beatty. She's a Democrat who represents Ohio in the U.S. House. Congresswoman, thank you very much. BEATTY: Thank you.

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril.

It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose.""

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: By now, we assume most people have heard about the talk - that's the conversation many African American parents have with their kids about how to avoid altercations with police or what to do and say if you're stopped. But with the recent unrest sparked by anger over police brutality against black men, it got us thinking about the role that white parents could play in talking to their kids about race. Jennifer Harvey is the author of ""Raising White Kids: Bringing Up Children In A Racially Unjust America."" She's also professor of religion at Drake University. And she's with us now. Professor Harvey, thanks so much for talking to us. JENNIFER HARVEY: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: You just actually wrote a piece for cnn.com titled ""How Do I Make Sure I'm Not Raising The Next Amy Cooper?"" - Amy Cooper being the white woman in Central Park who was recently recorded calling the police on an African American man who had just asked her to leash her dog, which is, in fact, the law... HARVEY: Yeah. MARTIN: And, you know... HARVEY: Yes. MARTIN: ...Invoking his race - basically saying, I'm going to tell the police that a black man is threatening me. And I want to read from what you wrote. You say, most white parents of today have come up in families in which white silence was a pervasive norm in our socialization. These same parents are now passing such silence on to their kids. Could you talk a bit more about that? HARVEY: Sure. So, you know, many white Americans today were raised in families where explicit racism was not what parents were trying. Now, of course, some white Americans were raised in such families, but many of us were raised in families that thought that they were teaching equality. But the way that they did that was to just say, well, we're all equal and not say anything more explicit about, what does it mean when you believe everyone should be equal, but many members of our society do not experience equality? And so what happens is the racist culture that we live in. And Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum talks about it as smog. Our kids, our youth, we adults just breathe it in, so we end up showing up in racist ways even from - when we come from families where equality was the presumed value. MARTIN: You say that - well, here's what you wrote. You said that sometimes, it sounds like everybody's equal. Sometimes we white parents tell our kids, be colorblind. Sometimes we even say celebrate diversity. And you say, but we say this while failing to notice we're expecting children to be magically immune from the same racism-induced tensions that get in the way of white adults successfully navigating diversity and sustaining interracial relationships. I mean, you say sort of the consequence of that is the silence you said kind of breeds what? HARVEY: It breeds a lack of capacity among white people to engage well in conversations about race, to talk about and respond when racism is happening. So we literally develop not enough capacity to, for example, oh, I hear racism out on the street or from a co-worker. Should I challenge it? What should I say about it? And then, if I have friendships across racial lines, if my African American colleagues or friends see me be silent because I don't know what to do, I become untrustworthy, right? So I think about this with children and youth, for example. You asked about - you know, named the talk. If my 11-year-old, who is white - if I only ever say to her, hey, police are safe, go find one if you're in trouble, but her African American cousin who's 13 is learning really complicated messages about the police because his parents have to teach him that, they can be great friends for a while, but eventually over time, their friendship - the depth of it will erode because she - my white child will not be able to identify with her African American cousin, her African American friends. And so I have to teach my kids, we all white Americans have to teach our white kids how to identify with that experience and how to be good friends to black and brown youth as they grow up. And that requires us teaching about - them about racism. And it requires us teaching them and modeling anti-racism, which is something a lot of white Americans really struggle with, even when we think we want to. MARTIN: So let's talk some practical things here. Obviously, this has a very deep stem, and there are so many more conversations that ensue, but - or should ensue, as you point out. Let's start with a video like the one that just surfaced - clearly not the first, but it may be the first for some child, right - seeing what has emerged here at this African American man being pinned to the street, you know, saying I can't breathe and calling for help and the other officers standing around to - you know, some of them participating and one of them just standing there. HARVEY: Yes. MARTIN: How do you discuss this? Do you wait for the child to come to you? Do you show it to the child and say, this is something I need to talk about with you? HARVEY: So in white families, we cannot wait to talk about it with our children, because segregation is so deep that if we just wait, it will never come up. Having said that, I never show my video - my children videos of black people being killed by police. I try not to watch those videos myself. I do talk about the videos with them. And I started doing that work with my own children before they even had words, really. I would make sure we were in spaces where we were engaged in anti-police brutality visuals and organizing. And I knew they wouldn't exactly understand what was going on. But, for example, my 5-year-old one time - after a rally we were at when we got in the car, she started saying, black people are not safe. And I said, yes. That's true. And then she said, white - but we're white, so we are safe. And I said, yeah, that's true, too. And then I said to her, and the reason we went to this rally to be with people is because we're trying to tell the government - that's how you tell it to a 5-year-old - we're trying to tell the government that everybody deserves to be safe. So now, you know, six years later, she's already got deep understanding of this. And so we can talk about what happened to George Floyd and, you know, we were much further along the conversation than if I had waited until she was 14 to start talking about this with her. MARTIN: Obviously, for some people who just feel that people of color, black people in particular, are inferior or are in - prone to criminality and therefore deserve whatever happens to them - that's a different mindset, right - different conversation? HARVEY: Yes. MARTIN: But for people who just say, you know what? This stuff just gives me a headache. I don't want to be bothered. This isn't my problem. I just - why do I have to think about this? I have problems of my own. What do you say? HARVEY: Well, when I get to talk to those folks, or when they'll say that out loud to me, I ask them what they would do it - would they call it a headache if it was their child or their sister or their brother or their parent? To white parents who say, this is too much work, or this is too much, and I'm tired, my messaging, my belief and the way I'm trying to live, is, we're talking about our fellow human beings.

1621986042,2020-05-31 18:06:00,A National Day Of Mourning Honoring COVID-19 Victims Holds New Meaning,https://www.upr.org/post/national-day-mourning-honoring-covid-19-victims-holds-new-meaning,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: And finally today, amid the grief and anger that's engulfed the nation over the past week, there's also the reality that we're still in the middle of a global health crisis - the coronavirus, COVID-19. Just days ago, we saw the death toll from COVID-19 surpass 100,000 in the U.S. alone. To mourn that immense loss of life as a country, faith leaders from across traditions have come together and called for a National Day of Mourning and Lament to be observed tomorrow. It's a day that likely takes on additional meaning now as so many continue to protest the death of George Floyd and other people of color recently killed in ways that are seen as unjust. Joining us now to tell us more is the Reverend Jim Wallis, one of the faith leaders behind the call for tomorrow's National Day of Mourning. And he is with us now. Reverend Wallis, thank you so much for talking with us. JIM WALLIS: Thank you, Michel - blessing to be with you as always. MARTIN: As I just said, you called for this national day of mourning tomorrow with the pandemic in mind. But does this moment take on additional meaning, as I suggested earlier? Does this signify something in addition now? WALLIS: It does. This is a moment - another moment, an endless number of moments like this - and a moment with a video. And we have to understand what that moment means. And so this video shows a white knee on a black neck. And that white knee is not just a moment, an incident. This white knee is a system. And I want white parents and particularly white Christian parents on this Sunday to understand that every black parent I know - every black parent I know - in that video sees the face and the neck of their black sons and daughters under that white cop's knee, and they see themselves under that white knee. And this white knee is a system, a culture. White supremacy is the virus, the pandemic underneath this pandemic. It's a virus. It's a disease. It's a sickness that's killing people. And it's an idol (ph), biblically, theologically - it's a sin. And so we are in a war with this virus of white supremacy. MARTIN: What do you envision for tomorrow? Because Because in the original kind of convening tomorrow, in part it was meant to acknowledge the fact that many people have been unable to gather in order to mourn those who have been lost. And I know that you've been working with faith leaders across the country. You've also been working with mayors in cities across the country. But now we are in a moment when many people are being discouraged again from gathering for reasons that are both similar and so different. So what do you envision tomorrow? WALLIS: Well, you're right. Many clergy, imams, rabbis and priests and pastors have pointed out to us that most of these hundred thousand people have died mostly alone, without the usual loved ones gathered around them. And the pain of that is overwhelming. And so tomorrow, we will take our faith to the streets, and in this case, the virtual streets of this nation, where mayors and interfaith clergy will acknowledge this moment. And to pray for the nation does not mean just praying for those who are sick or who have died of COVID. It means to pray for the healing of a nation that this virus has revealed is broken, a broken nation. The fissures, the structures, the systems that have been revealed by COVID, those must be healed. And until white people and white Christians say this is intolerable, it is no longer acceptable. And we will stop it in the debate, Michel, the debate over weapons - what are our weapons? No, not breaking windows and - all of that's a part of rage. I understand. But our weapons are truth, telling the truth. And this is a moment to tell the truth. And I want to throw out here, while this is a nonpartisan moment tomorrow, mayors - Republican, Democrat - are all calling for mourning and lamenting and remembering to pray for this nation that our votes, Our votes are weapons too. And the votes of every American must be readied for this moment. MARTIN: But let me ask you about that. I mean, you said that - and you've said in your call for tomorrow's National Day of Mourning and Lament, you've said that the vocation of remembering and honoring the dead transcends politics and unites us across lines of religion. Perhaps technically so, but I'm looking at the lists of people who are specifically supporting this effort. I don't see any of the big sort of evangelical megapastors who've been particularly identified, for example, with the Trump administration. You know, why is that? I mean, presumably, are they not also mourning a hundred thousand people dead to COVID-19 as well as the loss of life in unjust ways? I mean, why is that? WALLIS: Why is that is the question. I don't see them either. But I want to point out that Walter Kim, who's the new president the National Association of Evangelicals, the NAE, he signed this. He's in this. He is part of this. He did a video about this. He is calling all his National Association of Evangelical churches to participate today and tomorrow. But why aren't the Trump evangelicals there? That's a good question. They should be asked why they are not there to mourn and weep and to lament the deaths of all these who have died and to pray for the healing of the nation where all these discrepancies and disparities have been revealed. MARTIN: What exactly are you hoping will happen tomorrow? What is it that people are to do, especially people who are still observing social distancing guidelines? WALLIS: Yeah. Well, this will be done virtually all over the country in city after. I still hear another city, another state, another city is joining all over the country. Mayors are coming together with interfaith clergy in their cities across this nation to mourn and lament and name and honor and and remember those who have passed among this hundred thousand, which is, as you know, whole cities, multiple stadiums, 400 airliners, 25 empty National Cathedrals, an enormous number - twice the Vietnam wall. That can't go unmarked and unpassed (ph) and unrecognized. So we will recognize all those names, as is our vocation, the mayors with their Muslim, Jewish, Christian clergy alongside them in virtual ceremonies and calls all over this nation tomorrow in all these cities. And we'll be praying for the healing of the nation, which includes those who are still sick, and certainly all those who've died and their families, they've died alone. But we'll pray for the healing of the nation and the divisions and injustice that this COVID virus has revealed. We're going to be praying for all of that tomorrow. MARTIN: That was the Reverend Jim Wallis. He is the president of Sojourners. That's a Christian group and publication with a specific focus on social justice. You can find out more about tomorrow's National Day of Mourning and Lament by going to their website, which is sojo.net net or the website for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Reverend Wallis, thanks so much for joining us. WALLIS: Great to be with you, Michel, always is. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1621986037,2020-06-01 01:30:00,Violence Escalates As Protests Over George Floyd Death Continue,https://www.upr.org/post/violence-escalates-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"Updated 2:25 p.m. ET Protesters staged large-scale demonstrations across the country on Sunday, expressing outrage at the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and, more broadly, anger at police brutality. Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls. NPR's Gerry Holmes contributed to this report. : 6/03/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said the truck drove into the crowd while westbound on Interstate 35.

That is also not what this movement is about,” Scott said. This movement – the Black Lives Matter movement – has never been about inciting violence and destroying property. This movement has always been about fighting against police violence and fighting for black lives.” Scott said when Black Lives Matter does protest it is used as a last resort and strategic reasons only – and only done peacefully.

AG to lead prosecution of George Floyd’s death; protests turn violent,https://gephardtdaily.com/national-international/minn-ag-to-lead-prosecution-of-george-floyds-death-protests-turn-violent/,en,False,,307157,gephardtdaily.com,http://gephardtdaily.com/,"June 1 (UPI) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison accepted the governor’s request to lead the prosecution related to the police-involved death of George Floyd as protests seeking justice for his killing turned violent throughout the country. Protests have raged throughout the United States since Monday when Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed while handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer in Minneapolis. At least five people have died since in connection to the civil unrest that has upended cities, forced governors to activate the National Guard and caused dozens of curfews to be imposed. Derek Chauvin, the white police officer who has since been fired and was seen in footage of Floyd’s death with his knee on the prostrate suspect’s neck, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Ellison “needs to lead this case.” Walz said during a press conference the protesters are making clear they don’t trust the system and that they see it as designed to deny justice to communities of color, and that the government must start restoring trust and faith in that system. “When I spoke to the Floyd family, they were very clear they wanted the system to work for them, they wanted to believe that there was trust and they wanted to believe the facts would be heard and justice would be served,” the Democratic governor said. “And I can tell you in Minnesota, having Keith Ellison as the lead on this case, that will happen.” Ellison said he accepts the responsibility “with a large degree of humility.” He warned the public that prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide, is very difficult and that every aspect of their prosecution will be attacked by the defense, but they intend to be “absolutely prepared.” “I want to ask you for your trust that we are pursuing truth, we are pursuing it relentlessly and we are pursuing it on behalf of the state of Minnesota,” he said to the public. In Washington, D.C., police fired pepper bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters near the White House on Sunday night as authorities responded to multiple fires. D.C. Fire and EMS said fires at a comfort station in Lafayette Square and the lobby of AFL-CIO had been extinguished, as had a basement fire in the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, all within a short walk to the White House. “This church has been standing in our city since the early 1800s,” the D.C. Police Department tweeted. “Please avoid the area.” Police reported groups of people broke into a Target and a shopping mall, resulting in several arrests. The Metropolitan Police Department said in a release at least 17 people were charged with felony rioting, destruction of property, looting, theft and other such crimes over Saturday night with several others sought in connection to the crimes. Late Sunday, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the enforcement of an 11 p.m. curfew and that she had activated the National Guard to support local police. Police use of either flashbangs or tear gas to disperse protesters has been reported in several cities, including Denver, Atlanta and Cincinnati. In Boston, police said seven officers were transported to the hospital and more were treated on the streets as protests devolved into violence and chaos over Sunday night that saw 21 police cruisers damaged. Forty people were arrested, the Boston Police Department tweeted. Mayor Marty Walsh said he thanks the protesters who demonstrated peacefully and said their message was heard while expressing anger over those “who came into our city and chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence undermining their message.” “If we are to achieve change and if we are to lead the change, our efforts must be rooted in peace and regard for our community,” he tweeted. The peaceful demonstrations devolved into violence after the sun went down, and police fired pepper spray at protesters after 9 p.m. after officers were hit with objects, WCVB 5 reported. In Philadelphia, where the curfew was pushed back to 6 p.m. after it was set for 8 p.m. the day prior, police said early Monday 137 people had been arrested, including 91 for code violation notices, 43 for looting or burglary, and one for assault of a police officer. Philadelphia’s managing director Brian Abernathy told reporters that stores had been looted throughout Sunday and at least five officers were injured, four vehicles were burned and officers were pelted with bricks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. Mayor Jim Kenney, referring to the looters as “anarchists,” said the looting and destruction of public property have “saddened and disappointed me beyond words.” “I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in our city — especially the thousands of Philadelphians who came out earlier in the day yesterday to peacefully yet forcefully protest,” he said during the press conference. “They made a tremendous statement about their decades of anger over a system that degrades black Americans because of the color of their skin.” Abernathy said the National Gaurd has been asked to support local law enforcement and to protect “our assets” as well as “sensitive areas.” Nearly 62,000 National Gaurd soldiers and airmen have been activated in 24 states to respond to civil disturbances, including the protests, national disasters and the coronavirus pandemic, but the number is expected to grow as civil unrest continues in the wake of Floyd’s death, the National Guard said in a statement. Chief of the National Guard Bureau Gen. Joseph Lengyel announced that about 5,000 National Guard members had been activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C., on Sunday with approximately 2,000 standing by. “Responding to civil unrest is the hardest mission your National Guard does. Our unique longstanding partnerships with local civilian first responders mean we are always ready, always there to help, when needed, where it’s needed,” said Lengyel. President Donald Trump called on Philadelphia and other cities and states led by Democratic leaders to activate the National Guard in a series of tweets on Sunday describing the protesters as “anarchists.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee activated an additional 200 members of the National Guard on Sunday in response to a request from the city of Seattle. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ communications director said he had activated 400 National Guard members throughout the state on Saturday. And Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp activated up to 3,000 National Gaurd troops ahead of the Sunday protests. Additionally, more than 40 cities imposed curfews for Sunday, while Texas and Virginia issued a state of emergency. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued a Declaration of Emergency at the request of local leaders and imposed a weeklong 8 p.m. curfew. “This gives law enforcement an additional tool to prevent the lawlessness we’ve seen here and in cities nationwide,” Ducey tweeted. “Police will be equipped to make arrests of individuals who are planning to riot, loot or cause damage and unrest.” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said late Sunday that protests in Murfreesboro were “no longer peaceful,” stating he has authorized the state’s highway patrol and the National Guard to provide support “on the ground in restoring order for the safety of our citizens.” Demonstrations in the city some 34 miles southeast of Nashville had escalated to “overt threats to public safety and property,” he tweeted without elaborating. Shane McFarland, Murfreesboro mayor, issued a State of Emergency late Sunday after a curfew was imposed at 6:30 p.m. The escalating unrest followed protests turning violent in Nashville on Saturday night, and Lee announced that the Department of Homeland Security, with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local police, have launched an investigation into “unlawful incidents that occurred.” “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those to justice.” In Minneapolis, police arrested protesters on Washington Avenue for violating the 8 p.m. curfew. The Minneapolis Police Department said 15 minutes before the curfew was enforced, an alert was sent to all cellphones. When the group failed to leave, officers encircled them, recovering one firearm, police tweeted. Late Sunday, the Minneapolis Police Department said incendiary materials and accelerants, such as water bottles filled with gasoline, had been found hidden in bushes throughout neighborhoods in the city. Some areas took additional precautions ahead of continued protests as Minnesota closed all major highways and Chicago closed the central business district and the Loop area to all except employees and residents. Due to the protests, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez postponed plans to reopen beaches in the county following shutdowns to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a strongly worded statement on Sunday, Attorney General William Barr blamed the looting and rioting on “groups of outside radicals and agitators” who are “exploiting the situation to pursue their own, separate, violent and extremist agenda.” “It is time to stop watching the violence and to confront and stop it,” he said. “The continued violence and destruction of property endangers the lives and livelihoods of others, and interferes with the rights of peaceful protesters, as other citizens.” Barr threatened groups instigating violence that they will be charged for committing domestic terrorism.",0.0

Several protestors gathered in front of the Provo Police Department building on Center Street, while many others remained in their cars and drove around the city honking their horns, holding signs out their windows and blaring music. The protests, which began at 5 p.m. Saturday, featured homemade signs reading “Justice for George,” “Stop police brutality” and “No justice, no peace.” Chants of “black lives matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “white silence is violence” broke out during the protests in front of the police station. Demonstrators gathered on both sides of Center Street and on the median, cheering often as cars drove by and honked. Protestors also raised their fists and took a knee at one point as they held a moment of silence for Floyd, who died Monday after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Friday. Women’s March Provo organized the initial demonstration on Facebook, which was to protest the death of not only Floyd but also Bernardo Palacios, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City police officers on May 23. The Facebook group set up a car caravan up and down University Avenue in Provo from 300 South to 2230 North that was to run from 5 to 6 p.m. As the start time for the demonstration became closer, however, several Provo residents took to social media to organize additional protests in front of the Provo Police Department. Other protests took place elsewhere across Utah on Saturday, including one in Salt Lake City that featured a police car being overturned and burned. Several other demonstrations have also taken place throughout the country over the last few days, sometimes turning violent.",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622327305,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.kuer.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.'

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response.

Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back.

1622327295,2020-06-01 08:00:00,Salt Lake Rallies to Clean Up After Day Of Protests And Damage,https://www.kuer.org/post/salt-lake-rallies-clean-after-day-protests-and-damage,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated 9:47 a.m. MDT 6/1/2020 Salt Lake City officials launched a massive cleanup effort on Sunday, the day after intense protests through downtown Salt Lake City left a wake of damage, including spray painted graffiti on the State Capitol, smashed windows and overturned and burned two cars, including a police cruiser. The total cost and extent of the damage was still being assessed as of Sunday, officials said, who hailed residents’ efforts to aid in cleanup efforts while vowing to investigate who was responsible. A spokeswoman with the mayor’s office said 12 windows were shattered at the City and County Building, several more at the Public Safety Building and most of the front windows of the Salt Lake City Courts Building. “Peaceful protest will always have a place in our community,” Gov. Gary Herbert said in a statement released Sunday. “But the events of yesterday were beyond the pale. I was greatly troubled to see the vandalism carried out on the Capitol building, public spaces and private property in our downtown area.” What started as a protest against police violence in the aftermath of the recent in-custody death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, turned volatile Saturday afternoon. Violent confrontations involving police and demonstrators spurred Herbert to activate the National Guard and Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall to enact a citywide curfew starting 8 p.m. Saturday. With the curfew in effect, the streets had calmed by early Sunday morning and crews — including a number of volunteers — were out to clean the wreckage. “I’ve been overwhelmed by an outpouring of love for our city,” Mendenhall told reporters Sunday morning. “Residents, fellow cities and community members and organizations have offered to volunteer clean up and are helping to put our city back together.” Mendenhall said people even came out in the middle of the night to collect heaps of trash. Graffiti removal teams from other cities around the Salt Lake Valley had also come out to help, but it will still take several days to fully recover, she said. Salt Lake resident Don Gamble stopped his Harley by the Capitol when he saw the graffiti, and picked up a power washer to help out. “I’ve been watching it on TV as of [Saturday] night,” he said. “It just disgusts me that my tax money pays for these buildings and people have the right to destroy them.” Still, Mendenhall said people shouldn’t necessarily come out in droves. City officials in a web post suggested other ways to help restore the city, and stressed that Salt Lake is still in the “orange” reopening phase of COVID-19. They asked that volunteers wear masks and gloves, and remain at least 6 feet away from anyone who is not part of their household. “Right now, frankly we don’t want thousands of people coming into the downtown core at once,” Mendenhall said. “That is antithetic to the curfew that we have in place.” Cleanup efforts, however, were one of the exempted activities from the city’s curfew, which forbid people from being out in public in Salt Lake City until 6 a.m. Monday. Volunteers were allowed to gather in small groups to help out. But a planned all-day Facebook event to organize thousands of people for a mass effort Monday was cancelled in response to the mayor’s concerns about bringing too many people in at one time. More suggestions for how to help restore the city are available on the city’s website. In addition to cleaning efforts, Mendenhall suggested supporting a local business in the downtown area.",0.0
1622375237,2020-06-01 09:27:37,Civil unrest could influence Joe Biden’s search for running mate,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/6/1/21276784/joe-biden-running-mate-vice-president-democrat-george-floyd-protests-unrest,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden’s campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward.” Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. “It doesn’t really matter what I think,” she said. “What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks.” Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. “As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?” Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden’s running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has “proliferated.” “The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,” he said. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Connor Peebles, 21, was arrested Sunday for investigation of criminal mischief, rioting and assault on a police officer. During the riot in downtown Salt Lake City, several people were seen pushing an unoccupied Salt Lake police vehicle onto its side. The patrol car was later set on fire. Salt Lake police released surveillance photos of four men who detectives wanted to question in connection with the incident. On Sunday, Peebles walked up to officers and said he “wanted to turn himself in from the rioting last night. ... (He said) he helped flipped an officer’s police car during the riots, broke out two windows of the police car” and threw water bottles at officers, according to a police affidavit. Anyone with information about others involved in damaging the patrol car or other incidents can call police at 801-799-3000. The burning patrol car was one of the most visible moments of Saturday’s riot. But there were other reports of broken windows and vandalism throughout the downtown area. Salt Lake City Justice Court was closed Monday as crews repaired damage to its brick facade, cleared graffiti and boarded up 12 to 15 broken windows. Virtual hearings continued to be held online and the court planned to reopen Tuesday, said presiding Judge Clemens Landau. In an order directing the temporary closure, Landau and his colleagues noted the court had managed to stay open amid the pandemic, the March earthquake and a series of aftershocks, and several earlier rallies. “Through it all, our modus operandi could be aptly summarized using the very words now scrawled on our street-side walls: “No justice, No Peace,” the order reads. The city will repair the physical damage in short order, the judges wrote, “but we also know that the social and psychological wounds exposed by George Floyd’s killing will take much longer to heal. We are painfully aware that municipal courts like ours have historically been situated on, or at least very near, the tip of systemic racism’s spear.” The judges said they’re making an effort to reverse that by trying to make sure juries reflect the diversity of the community and working with academics at Harvard to analyze and address implicit bias among jurors. Just a few blocks away, hearings went on as normal Monday at the state’s 3rd District Matheson Courthouse on 400 South and State. A broken window at the west entrance was the only damage the building sustained, said state courts spokesman Geoffrey Fattah. Damaged was estimated at $10,000. Two women were arrested Saturday night for investigation of disorderly conduct for allegedly throwing the rocks. With more demonstrations expected this week, members of the Utah National Guard remain scheduled to join local law enforcement in helping to keep the peace. The citizen-soldiers were activated by Gov. Gary Herbert over the weekend as protests grew contentious. Sgt. Nathaniel Free, public information specialist for the Utah National Guard, said their support duties of the approximately 150 soldiers will continue as long as they are needed. “We’ve maintained blockades here in Salt Lake City, but mostly just working at the direction of Salt Lake PD,” he said, adding that National Guard soldiers will be available on a rotational basis for the time being at the express direction of the governor. “We work for the governor.

Or Participate In It',https://www.upr.org/post/former-president-obama-lets-not-excuse-violence-or-participate-it,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"Former President Barack Obama said the protests in cities across the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis under a police officer's knee ""represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States."" But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

This comes after a recent thread on Twitter started by a Wall Street Journal reporter who said: “I lost my glasses and my ankle is in searing pain after NYPD hit me in the face multiple times with riot shields and pushed me to the ground. I was backing away as a request, with my hands up. My NYPD-issued press badge was clearly visible. I’m just sitting here crying.

You can do it. Throw on some Kendrick Lamar and get your head in the right space. Pour yourself a big old glass of salt juice. Draw an ice bath and fire up the cryotherapy pod and the infrared sauna. Then just pull the plug on him. You know you want to. You could answer the existential question of whether @realDonaldTrump even exists if he doesn’t exist on Twitter. I tweet, therefore I am. Dorsey meets Descartes. All it would take is one sweet click to force the greatest troll in the history of the internet to meet his maker. Maybe he just disappears in an orange cloud of smoke, screaming, “I’m melllllllting.” Do Trump — and the world — a favor and send him back into the void whence he came. And then go have some fun: Meditate and fast for days on end! Our country is going through biological, economic and societal convulsions. We can’t trust the powerful forces in this nation to tell us the truth or do the right thing. In fact, not only can we not trust them, we have every reason to believe they’re gunning for us. In Washington, the Trump administration’s deception about the virus was lethal. On Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, the fat cats who carved up the country, drained us dry and left us with no safety net profiteered off the virus. In Minneapolis, the barbaric death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on him for almost nine minutes showed yet again that black Americans have everything to fear from some who are charged with protecting them. As if that weren’t enough, from the slough of our despond, we have to watch Donald Trump duke it out with the lords of the cloud in a contest to see who can destroy our democracy faster. I wish I could go along with those who say this dark period of American life will ultimately make us nicer and simpler and more contemplative. How can that happen when the whole culture has been reengineered to put us at each other’s throats? Trump constantly torques up the tribal friction and cruelty, even as Twitter and Facebook refine their systems to ratchet up rage. It is amazing that a septuagenarian became the greatest exploiter of social media. Trump and Twitter were a match made in hell. The Wall Street Journal had a chilling report a few days ago that Facebook’s own research in 2018 revealed that “our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness. If left unchecked,” Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.” Article continues below Mark Zuckerberg shelved the research. Why not just let all the bots trying to undermine our elections and spreading false information about the coronavirus and right-wing conspiracy theories and smear campaigns run amok? Sure, we’re weakening our society, but the weird, infantile maniacs running Silicon Valley must be allowed to rake in more billions and finish their mission of creating a giant cyberorganism of people, one huge and lucrative ball of rage. “The shareholders of Facebook decided, ‘If you can increase my stock tenfold, we can put up with a lot of rage and hate,’” says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “These platforms have very dangerous profit motives. When you monetize rage at such an exponential rate, it’s bad for the world. These guys don’t look left or right; they just look down. They’re willing to promote white nationalism if there’s money in it. The rise of social media will be seen as directly correlating to the decline of Western civilization.” Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn’t as valuable as Facebook’s, made some mild moves against the president who has been spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. He added footnotes clarifying false Trump tweets about mail-in ballots and put a warning label on the president’s tweet about the Minneapolis riots that echoes the language of a Miami police chief in 1967 and segregationist George Wallace: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,” said one friend of the Twitter chief’s. “He’s like somebody trapped in a maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.” Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think Facebook should be “the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” It was a sickening display that made even some loyal Facebook staffers queasy. As The Verge’s Casey Newton reported, some employees objected to the company’s rationale in internal posts. “I have to say I am finding the contortions we have to go through incredibly hard to stomach,” one wrote. “All this points to a very high risk of a violent escalation and civil unrest in November, and if we fail the test case here, history will not judge us kindly.” Trump, furious that Dorsey would attempt to rein him in on the very platform that catapulted him into the White House, immediately decided to try to rein in Dorsey. He signed an executive order that might strip liability protection from social media sites, which would mean they would have to more assiduously police false and defamatory posts. Now that social media sites are behemoths, Galloway thinks that the removal of the Communications Decency Act makes a lot of sense, even if the president is trying to do it for the wrong reasons. Trump does not seem to realize, however, that he’s removing his own protection. He huffs and puffs about freedom of speech when he really wants the freedom to be vile. “It’s the mother of all cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face moves,” says Galloway. The president wants to say things on Twitter that he will not be allowed to say if he exerts this control over Twitter. In a sense, it’s Trump versus his own brain. If Twitter can be sued for what people say on it, how can Trump continue to torment? Wouldn’t thousands of his own tweets have to be deleted? “He’d be the equivalent of a slippery floor at a store that sells equipment for hip replacements,” says Galloway, who also posits that, in our hyperpoliticized world, this will turn Twitter into a Democratic site and Facebook into a Republican one. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose district encompasses Twitter, said that it did little good for Dorsey to put up a few fact-checks while letting Trump’s rants about murder and other “misrepresentations” stay up. “Facebook, all of them, they are all about making money,” the speaker said. “Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts.” She crisply concluded that “all they want is to not pay taxes; they got their tax break in 2017,” and “they don’t want to be regulated, so they pander to the White House.” C’mon, Jack.

1622589772,2020-06-01 13:59:44,"Watch live: Utah’s 4th District GOP contenders to debate amid pandemic, civil unrest",https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/06/01/watch-live-utahs-th/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"Washington • Four Utah Republicans hoping to take on — and topple — Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams sparred Monday over the leadership of President Donald Trump, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, rioting in major U.S. cities and even the wearing of masks in public. The GOP contenders looking to win the GOP nomination in the June 30 primary also complained about “out of state” protesters wreaking havoc in Salt Lake City over the weekend — a false claim as arrest records show most were Utah residents. It took 54 minutes for McAdams' name to be uttered in the 4th Congressional District debate, and even then nonprofit executive Trent Christensen called the incumbent “Ben Pelosi,” a perhaps intentional or unintentional mixture of McAdams first name with the last name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Christensen and former radio host Jay McFarland boasted of their ability to work across the aisle while state Rep. Kim Coleman touted her conservative record in the Utah Legislature, and former NFL player Burgess Owens derided Democrats for ruining the country. “We're dealing with people who hate our country,” Owens said. “I will not negotiate a compromise with anyone who hates my country, because they have a totally different endgame.” Earlier in the debate — held at the University of Utah's PBS studio without an audience and the candidates physically distanced — Owens said Republicans need to take back the U.S. House to halt Democrats' liberal agenda. “The reason why we’re being held hostage is because the Democrats are run by Marxists and socialists and they could care less about the middle class,” Owens said. “They care less about we the people [and] the small business owners. As a matter of fact, the more misery that we experience, the more power they get.” McFarland charged back that it was language like that keeps Republicans and Democrats from working together to find solutions. “I think we have to change who we're sending” to Congress, McFarland said. “We're choosing extremes who can't even look at the other side, can't even talk to the other side. How can we expect them to come together with any solutions — by calling them Marxist, calling them all kinds of evil names in the book — and then you want to go to Washington and say, 'Hey, sit down with me and let's come up with a solution together.' It's not reasonable. We need to choose people who can talk to each other.” Coleman said she has a record as a conservative in the Legislature but also worked with Democrats on finding solutions. Article continues below “The problem is that sometimes compromise is asking that one side give everything,” Coleman said. “And that's what we're not seeing in Congress right now.” The state lawmaker praised Trump and Congress for quick action on relief legislation during the coronavirus outbreak and to let states respond as they needed to own without orders from Washington. But she warned against more legislation that she says isn’t bipartisan. “If Republicans in the Senate have to continue to negotiate with the Democrats in the House, we’re going to get these kinds of pork barrel types of proposals,” she said, likely a reference to a House-passed $3 trillion relief bill. “And in addition to what’s been mentioned, Nancy Pelosi is suggesting that red states that have healthy economies would bail out blue states that have not been as responsible as Utah.” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has been one of the voices in the GOP-run Senate arguing that Congress should have a discussion about providing money to states to deal with budget woes caused by the pandemic and has noted that some Republican-led states are suffering more than Democratic-led states. The GOP candidates, for the most part, carefully lauded Trump, who may be popular among hardcore Republicans but is not a beloved figure in the 4th Congressional District where polls show more people disfavor him than support him. Owens, though, painted himself as a Trump supporter, saying America needs a Congress that will let the president do what he needs to do. “He's the right man at the right time,” Owens said. McFarland, too, praised the president's response to the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m trying to think of a time when a president has had to balance lives with livelihoods,” McFarland said. “And you think about that balance that he is trying to find, maybe three times in the history of our country has a president had to make that choice. And I think he’s done as best a job as anybody could without a playbook.” The Trump White House was left with a 69-page guide by President Barack Obama’s administration in dealing with outbreaks. It was labeled, “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.” In discussing the protests in major U.S. cities, including one in Salt Lake City where a police car and another vehicle were overturned and burnt, the candidates decried out-of-state antagonists as the driving force. Christensen, when asked about Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s response to the protests, praised her leadership and the Salt Lake Police Department’s swift actions. “We had a response that was able to bring the temperature down and get those people who were from out of state who were inciting violence, get them out,” Christensen said. “Listen, the people inciting violence, they're the enemies, not the protesters, not the police.” Owens, too, blamed outside people. “This is not who we are,” he said. “For this to happen in Utah, means that somebody's coming in to get it done.” Of the 46 people police said were arrested and booked for crimes during the protests in the capital city, The Salt Lake Tribune could find only two listing out-of-state addresses among the 40 it could identify through public records. Thirty-five had Utah residences. The newspaper was unable to find addresses for three others. Three of the candidates said they were not wearing masks in public despite advice from health officials to do so to halt the spread of the coronavirus. “I don’t,” Christensen said. “If a business asks me to do so in order to patronize the business, I will. But I believe it’s a choice. ... I don’t have a problem with masks. What I do have a problem with is being told I have to wear a mask. That’s not how we do things in America. What you’re going to see is a vaccine come out for this and what I don’t want to have happen is them saying, ‘Well, you had to wear a mask, now you need to have a vaccine.’ So in America, we get to choose.” Coleman said she “generally” doesn't wear a mask but tries to “respect the distance” of other people in public. Owens said he doesn't and noted that originally, health care officials said masks wouldn't help. “I get to choose not to,” he said. “I think it comes down to small businesses. ... If people want to be in a place where masks are dictated, then go for it. But in terms of myself, I don't.” McFarland, who noted he has a daughter with “extreme asthma,” said he wears a mask in public because it shows respect for other people's health. “It may help her,” he said. “Nobody has a gun to your head [forcing you to wear a mask]. Part of exercising personal liberty is to do so responsibly. What happened to love thy neighbor? What happened to civil respect for other people? I wear a mask when I'm in public for that reason. “ The GOP candidates all said they opposed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and would vote to repeal it. “What challenges we do have in health care are better resolved through free market principles,” Coleman said. “And the ACA took us into an entirely different direction. Now there are pieces of the ACA that people like and would like to see remain in a repeal and replace [bill].” Owens said the “systemic problem” with health care is “more and more government regulations, more and more government dictation” that doesn't look for the solutions that help people.",0.0
1622589766,2020-06-01 15:31:23,Weber State professor under investigation for tweets threatening those involved in police protests,https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/06/01/weber-state-professor/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"Weber State University will investigate a criminal justice professor who allegedly made several threatening comments about those involved in the nationwide protests this weekend against use of deadly force by police, including a Twitter post about how he would have driven a car into a crowd. The school declined to say Monday if professor Scott Senjo would be put on leave or what the review would include. WSU spokeswoman Allison Barlow Hess said the university is aware of the posts and “looking into the issue.” She added: “Weber State University does not condone violence or threats of violence under any circumstance.” Senjo, who has been at the school since August 2000, did not respond to a request for comment. The account where the comments were posted, @ProfSenjo, is linked to his Weber State email address and the cellphone number listed on his curriculum vitae. One comment from the account was a response to a video of a police car speeding into a crowd of protesters in New York City. That action has been criticized both by the New York police commissioner and mayor, along with those at the demonstration who say they feared being run over. The comment from Senjo’s account said: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” 1 of 12 View Caption (Screenshot) A tweet from the account @ProjSenjo, linked to a Weber State professor.

Tyler Blint-Welsh of the Wall Street Journal said he was hit in the face by New York police officer and pushed to the ground — after showing his press badge. A tweet from the Senjo account told Blint-Welsh that if he were an officer, “you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” Several individuals on Twitter have said that they’ve reported the tweets and the account. And many shared them, too, calling for Senjo to be fired. The demonstrations across the country have come in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed last week after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters have denounced racism and deadly force by law enforcement. And in many cities, including Salt Lake City, the rallies have turned violent. In Utah’s capital, demonstrators overturned a police car and lit it on fire. They also threw rocks at the windows of businesses. Officers responded with rubber bullets and arrests. And the city was put under a strict curfew. Article continues below A tweet from Senjo’s account responded to that curfew, too, which had been instituted by Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. It calls the protesters “disgusting losers” and also attacks Mendenhall. “You got what you deserve, idiot. You arrest them,” it read. Other posts label those demonstrating as “savages and criminals” and “thugs and rioters.” A May 30 post said that some are just “bored from the pandemic lockdown” and looking for “some great stuff for their Instagram followers.” And it suggests that they are paid to be there by billionaire George Soros. The responses came amid retweets of many right-wing conservative figures, including commentator Tomi Lahren and President Donald Trump. Another post attacks U.S Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, with the writer saying he would send her back to Somalia if he were in charge (though she is a naturalized American citizen). Some also applaud that a CNN building in Atlanta was damaged during the protests, and state that if an officer “wants to murder someone, it will happen with a firearm in a dark alley.” On May 31, a post from the account said he wouldn’t “just display firearms,” but suggested a reader come to his neighborhood and “I’ll show you how they work.” One questioned why people weren’t rioting “because 20 blacks kill each other every weekend in Chicago.” And another said, in response to concerns that a woman was hit by a rubber bullet in New York, that “if the woman who got arrested in that park was black, and got shot, gosh maybe she should’ve avoided that park.” In a longer statement later Monday, Weber State said, those ""comments made by our faculty member are hurtful and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University.” The school said it would take appropriate action after a full investigation. It added: “We join with our students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends who found these comments to be abhorrent.” And it advises anyone who needs support to talk to WSU’s assistant vice president for diversity, Adrienne Andrews, at 801-626-7243 or adrienneandrews@weber.edu. Senjo, according to the faculty page, started at Weber State in 2000 as an associate professor in criminal justice. He was promoted to tenured professor in 2008. Generally, getting tenure protects faculty from action against their positions. He has previously taught at California State University, Bakersfield, and Florida Atlantic University. He studied, too, at the University of Utah.",0.0

You can do it. Throw on some Kendrick Lamar and get your head in the right space. Pour yourself a big old glass of salt juice. Draw an ice bath and fire up the cryotherapy pod and the infrared sauna. Then just pull the plug on him. You know you want to. You could answer the existential question of whether @realDonaldTrump even exists if he doesn’t exist on Twitter. I tweet, therefore I am. Dorsey meets Descartes. All it would take is one sweet click to force the greatest troll in the history of the internet to meet his maker. Maybe he just disappears in an orange cloud of smoke, screaming, “I’m melllllllting.” Do Trump — and the world — a favor and send him back into the void whence he came. And then go have some fun: Meditate and fast for days on end! Our country is going through biological, economic and societal convulsions. We can’t trust the powerful forces in this nation to tell us the truth or do the right thing. In fact, not only can we not trust them, we have every reason to believe they’re gunning for us. In Washington, the Trump administration’s deception about the virus was lethal. On Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, the fat cats who carved up the country, drained us dry and left us with no safety net profiteered off the virus. In Minneapolis, the barbaric death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on him for almost nine minutes showed yet again that black Americans have everything to fear from some who are charged with protecting them. As if that weren’t enough, from the slough of our despond, we have to watch Donald Trump duke it out with the lords of the cloud in a contest to see who can destroy our democracy faster. I wish I could go along with those who say this dark period of American life will ultimately make us nicer and simpler and more contemplative. How can that happen when the whole culture has been reengineered to put us at each other’s throats? Trump constantly torques up the tribal friction and cruelty, even as Twitter and Facebook refine their systems to ratchet up rage. It is amazing that a septuagenarian became the greatest exploiter of social media. Trump and Twitter were a match made in hell. The Wall Street Journal had a chilling report a few days ago that Facebook’s own research in 2018 revealed that “our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness. If left unchecked,” Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.” Article continues below Mark Zuckerberg shelved the research. Why not just let all the bots trying to undermine our elections and spreading false information about the coronavirus and right-wing conspiracy theories and smear campaigns run amok? Sure, we’re weakening our society, but the weird, infantile maniacs running Silicon Valley must be allowed to rake in more billions and finish their mission of creating a giant cyberorganism of people, one huge and lucrative ball of rage. “The shareholders of Facebook decided, ‘If you can increase my stock tenfold, we can put up with a lot of rage and hate,’” says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “These platforms have very dangerous profit motives. When you monetize rage at such an exponential rate, it’s bad for the world. These guys don’t look left or right; they just look down. They’re willing to promote white nationalism if there’s money in it. The rise of social media will be seen as directly correlating to the decline of Western civilization.” Dorsey, who has more leeway because his stock isn’t as valuable as Facebook’s, made some mild moves against the president who has been spewing lies and inciting violence on Twitter for years. He added footnotes clarifying false Trump tweets about mail-in ballots and put a warning label on the president’s tweet about the Minneapolis riots that echoes the language of a Miami police chief in 1967 and segregationist George Wallace: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “Jack is really sincerely trying to find something to make it better,” said one friend of the Twitter chief’s. “He’s like somebody trapped in a maze, going down every hallway and turning every corner.” Zuckerberg, on the other hand, went on Fox to report that he was happy to continue enabling the Emperor of Chaos, noting that he did not think Facebook should be “the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.” It was a sickening display that made even some loyal Facebook staffers queasy. As The Verge’s Casey Newton reported, some employees objected to the company’s rationale in internal posts. “I have to say I am finding the contortions we have to go through incredibly hard to stomach,” one wrote. “All this points to a very high risk of a violent escalation and civil unrest in November, and if we fail the test case here, history will not judge us kindly.” Trump, furious that Dorsey would attempt to rein him in on the very platform that catapulted him into the White House, immediately decided to try to rein in Dorsey. He signed an executive order that might strip liability protection from social media sites, which would mean they would have to more assiduously police false and defamatory posts. Now that social media sites are behemoths, Galloway thinks that the removal of the Communications Decency Act makes a lot of sense, even if the president is trying to do it for the wrong reasons. Trump does not seem to realize, however, that he’s removing his own protection. He huffs and puffs about freedom of speech when he really wants the freedom to be vile. “It’s the mother of all cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face moves,” says Galloway. The president wants to say things on Twitter that he will not be allowed to say if he exerts this control over Twitter. In a sense, it’s Trump versus his own brain. If Twitter can be sued for what people say on it, how can Trump continue to torment? Wouldn’t thousands of his own tweets have to be deleted? “He’d be the equivalent of a slippery floor at a store that sells equipment for hip replacements,” says Galloway, who also posits that, in our hyperpoliticized world, this will turn Twitter into a Democratic site and Facebook into a Republican one. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose district encompasses Twitter, said that it did little good for Dorsey to put up a few fact-checks while letting Trump’s rants about murder and other “misrepresentations” stay up. “Facebook, all of them, they are all about making money,” the speaker said. “Their business model is to make money at the expense of the truth and the facts.” She crisply concluded that “all they want is to not pay taxes; they got their tax break in 2017,” and “they don’t want to be regulated, so they pander to the White House.” C’mon, Jack.

1622589621,2020-06-01 13:59:44,"Watch live: Utah’s 4th District GOP contenders to debate amid pandemic, civil unrest",https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/06/01/watch-live-utahs-th/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Washington • Four Utah Republicans hoping to take on — and topple — Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams sparred Monday over the leadership of President Donald Trump, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, rioting in major U.S. cities and even the wearing of masks in public. The GOP contenders looking to win the GOP nomination in the June 30 primary also complained about “out of state” protesters wreaking havoc in Salt Lake City over the weekend — a false claim as arrest records show most were Utah residents. It took 54 minutes for McAdams' name to be uttered in the 4th Congressional District debate, and even then nonprofit executive Trent Christensen called the incumbent “Ben Pelosi,” a perhaps intentional or unintentional mixture of McAdams first name with the last name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Christensen and former radio host Jay McFarland boasted of their ability to work across the aisle while state Rep. Kim Coleman touted her conservative record in the Utah Legislature, and former NFL player Burgess Owens derided Democrats for ruining the country. “We're dealing with people who hate our country,” Owens said. “I will not negotiate a compromise with anyone who hates my country, because they have a totally different endgame.” Earlier in the debate — held at the University of Utah's PBS studio without an audience and the candidates physically distanced — Owens said Republicans need to take back the U.S. House to halt Democrats' liberal agenda. “The reason why we’re being held hostage is because the Democrats are run by Marxists and socialists and they could care less about the middle class,” Owens said. “They care less about we the people [and] the small business owners. As a matter of fact, the more misery that we experience, the more power they get.” McFarland charged back that it was language like that keeps Republicans and Democrats from working together to find solutions. “I think we have to change who we're sending” to Congress, McFarland said. “We're choosing extremes who can't even look at the other side, can't even talk to the other side. How can we expect them to come together with any solutions — by calling them Marxist, calling them all kinds of evil names in the book — and then you want to go to Washington and say, 'Hey, sit down with me and let's come up with a solution together.' It's not reasonable. We need to choose people who can talk to each other.” Coleman said she has a record as a conservative in the Legislature but also worked with Democrats on finding solutions. Article continues below “The problem is that sometimes compromise is asking that one side give everything,” Coleman said. “And that's what we're not seeing in Congress right now.” The state lawmaker praised Trump and Congress for quick action on relief legislation during the coronavirus outbreak and to let states respond as they needed to own without orders from Washington. But she warned against more legislation that she says isn’t bipartisan. “If Republicans in the Senate have to continue to negotiate with the Democrats in the House, we’re going to get these kinds of pork barrel types of proposals,” she said, likely a reference to a House-passed $3 trillion relief bill. “And in addition to what’s been mentioned, Nancy Pelosi is suggesting that red states that have healthy economies would bail out blue states that have not been as responsible as Utah.” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has been one of the voices in the GOP-run Senate arguing that Congress should have a discussion about providing money to states to deal with budget woes caused by the pandemic and has noted that some Republican-led states are suffering more than Democratic-led states. The GOP candidates, for the most part, carefully lauded Trump, who may be popular among hardcore Republicans but is not a beloved figure in the 4th Congressional District where polls show more people disfavor him than support him. Owens, though, painted himself as a Trump supporter, saying America needs a Congress that will let the president do what he needs to do. “He's the right man at the right time,” Owens said. McFarland, too, praised the president's response to the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m trying to think of a time when a president has had to balance lives with livelihoods,” McFarland said. “And you think about that balance that he is trying to find, maybe three times in the history of our country has a president had to make that choice. And I think he’s done as best a job as anybody could without a playbook.” The Trump White House was left with a 69-page guide by President Barack Obama’s administration in dealing with outbreaks. It was labeled, “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.” In discussing the protests in major U.S. cities, including one in Salt Lake City where a police car and another vehicle were overturned and burnt, the candidates decried out-of-state antagonists as the driving force. Christensen, when asked about Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s response to the protests, praised her leadership and the Salt Lake Police Department’s swift actions. “We had a response that was able to bring the temperature down and get those people who were from out of state who were inciting violence, get them out,” Christensen said. “Listen, the people inciting violence, they're the enemies, not the protesters, not the police.” Owens, too, blamed outside people. “This is not who we are,” he said. “For this to happen in Utah, means that somebody's coming in to get it done.” Of the 46 people police said were arrested and booked for crimes during the protests in the capital city, The Salt Lake Tribune could find only two listing out-of-state addresses among the 40 it could identify through public records. Thirty-five had Utah residences. The newspaper was unable to find addresses for three others. Three of the candidates said they were not wearing masks in public despite advice from health officials to do so to halt the spread of the coronavirus. “I don’t,” Christensen said. “If a business asks me to do so in order to patronize the business, I will. But I believe it’s a choice. ... I don’t have a problem with masks. What I do have a problem with is being told I have to wear a mask. That’s not how we do things in America. What you’re going to see is a vaccine come out for this and what I don’t want to have happen is them saying, ‘Well, you had to wear a mask, now you need to have a vaccine.’ So in America, we get to choose.” Coleman said she “generally” doesn't wear a mask but tries to “respect the distance” of other people in public. Owens said he doesn't and noted that originally, health care officials said masks wouldn't help. “I get to choose not to,” he said. “I think it comes down to small businesses. ... If people want to be in a place where masks are dictated, then go for it. But in terms of myself, I don't.” McFarland, who noted he has a daughter with “extreme asthma,” said he wears a mask in public because it shows respect for other people's health. “It may help her,” he said. “Nobody has a gun to your head [forcing you to wear a mask]. Part of exercising personal liberty is to do so responsibly. What happened to love thy neighbor? What happened to civil respect for other people? I wear a mask when I'm in public for that reason. “ The GOP candidates all said they opposed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and would vote to repeal it. “What challenges we do have in health care are better resolved through free market principles,” Coleman said. “And the ACA took us into an entirely different direction. Now there are pieces of the ACA that people like and would like to see remain in a repeal and replace [bill].” Owens said the “systemic problem” with health care is “more and more government regulations, more and more government dictation” that doesn't look for the solutions that help people.",0.0

1622612066,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.upr.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0
1622617560,2020-06-01 15:59:03,Music industry calls for Black Out Tuesday amid unrest,https://www.deseret.com/entertainment/2020/6/1/21277340/black-out-tuesday-music-industry-george-floyd-protests,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"NEW YORK — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M Records said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out on social media following Floyd’s death and the worldwide riots. Some musicians were spotted alongside crowds of protesters over the weekend, including Ariana Grande, J. Cole, Jamie Foxx, Chance the Rapper, Kehlani, Miguel, Tinashe, Lil Yachty and Halsey, who said she was hit with a pellet and a shrapnel shell in Los Angeles. LL Cool J turned to music to show his outrage and passion, posting a lengthy rap to social media. “For 400 years you had your knees on our necks, a garden of evil with no seeds of respect,” he rapped. “In America’s mirror all she sees is regret, instead of letting blood live they begging for blood let.” Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle was originally set to release their sophomore album, “Ungodly Hour,” on Friday. They told the AP on Monday that will release the album at other time. The singers also posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram, hoping to offer the world some positive energy. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.”",0.0
1622617557,2020-06-01 16:16:42,Police response to Salt Lake City riot: Too late or just right?,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/6/1/21277064/utah-salt-lake-city-protest-police-brutality-riots-george-floyd-violence-mayor-response,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"SALT LAKE CITY — The remains of a burned-out Salt Lake police car. Graffiti on the state Capitol. Broken glass on numerous buildings and TRAX platforms. Police in riot gear being pelted with rocks, bricks and water bottles. Those are some of the images that stand out from Saturday night’s riot in downtown Salt Lake City, leaving some to question whether the city and the police department waited too long before taking action. But Salt Lake City leaders defend and praise their police department’s response, saying every decision was “calculated” and “strategic” to prevent life-threatening escalation between protesters and police. To Salt Lake City Council Chairman Chris Wharton, the overturning and burning of a police cruiser was a “small sacrifice over physical clashes between officers and civilians,” he said. “I would rather have a police car that can be replaced be destroyed than lose a single life or have serious armed confrontations between civilians and police officers,” Wharton told the Deseret News Monday. After Salt Lake City’s streets quieted and groups of volunteers gathered to clean up debris and scrub away the graffiti, some, like a Republican lawmaker from Draper, have criticized Salt Lake City’s response. “The death of George Floyd was horrific and we all feel outraged, but this behavior is disgusting,” Rep. Jeff Stenquist wrote in a tweet Sunday, responding to a video of protesters overturning and vandalizing the Salt Lake police cruiser. “It’s unbelievable that #saltlakecity leaders tolerate violence and vandalism during protests like these,” Stenquist tweeted, questioning why the mayor and the Salt Lake City Council would “allow this.” “Respectfully, Representative, our police department is the best trained and most professional law enforcement agency in the state,” Wharton tweeted back. “They have received national attention for their deescalation efforts. People are upset and they are going to act out.” Stenquist, pointing to other protests happening in Minneapolis and other cities across the U.S., said “this wasn’t completely unexpected,” and the Salt Lake City protests “should not have been allowed to escalate to the point of property being destroyed and the governor needing to step in” by calling out the Utah National Guard. “Now some think they can resort to anarchy without consequences,” Stenquist tweeted. “Hopefully peace can be restored before people are hurt or killed.” No one was killed in the protests — but officers and civilians were injured. As for damage to public and private property, state and city officials are still tallying, but it’s likely tens of thousands of dollars in damage. No ‘playbook’ Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said Monday his department was surprised by how quickly the protests became violent, but said they were not caught off guard. “I wish there was a schedule and a playbook that we could all follow. That doesn’t occur,” he said. Brown told the Deseret News his department had a strategic plan for handling the situation in a way that no one would be hurt. “We made a tactical decision to give people a safe place to voice their opinions, feelings, and anger. When that space was no longer safe, we deployed with a carefully laid plan based on the current situation and dynamics,” he said. “I know there’s a lot of criticism about the time we gave to the people to exercise their First Amendment rights, but we do not take lightly the heavy responsibility of protecting lives from violence — both the protesters and all the responding officers. Equally, we do not take lightly any infringement upon people’s freedom of speech.” To Wharton, blaming the escalation to violence, looting and property damage on “lack of leadership or competence” in cities including Salt Lake City “is an oversimplification and ignores the greater context in which these events are transpiring.” Wharton said he has “empathy” for “anybody in our city that’s feeling frustrated and scared and like their government, whether it’s their city government, their state government or national government, is not hearing them and acknowledging these systematic failures.” Wharton said Salt Lake City officials knew the protests could escalate to violence — and they were prepared to respond. He praised officers for balancing the need for deescalation in their response, noting the protest could have gotten way more out of control. “If we lost even one life, this whole situation would have been even worse,” Wharton said.

The National Guard’s presence follows a weekend of protests across the nation to decry the death of George Floyd, a black man, who died while being taken into custody by police in Minneapolis earlier this week. Steve Griffin, Deseret News Former Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbnank, who is currently the vice president of Law Enforcement Strategy for the Center for Policing Equity, talked about the city’s response by comparing the two protests at the state Capitol and at the Salt Lake Main Library. At the Capitol, Utah Highway Patrol troopers stood shoulder to shoulder in their regular uniforms across the front steps leading to the main entrance. At one point, officers in riot gear briefly appeared at the top of the stairs, which seemed to fuel the crowd’s anger. Those officers then took off their riot gear. Two arrests were reported at the Capitol for failing to disperse after curfew. The Capitol and some surrounding structures were tagged with graffiti. But Bubank said the scene was strikingly different than downtown Salt Lake City where cars were burned and police in riot gear were pelted with rocks. During his tenure as the city’s top law enforcer, Burbank was known for defusing protests peacefully. His discussions with members of the Occupy Salt Lake movement in Pioneer Park in 2012, and protesters blocking Main Street in front of the federal courthouse in 2011 after Tim DeChristopher’s conviction, both ended without violence. On Saturday, Burbank said Salt Lake police should have started with the same strategy instead of sending everyone in full riot gear. “You want to have a presence there, but you don’t want to have a riot presence,” he said. When the focus of the crowd’s anger is the police, putting police in riot gear in front of them may not be the best strategy, he said. He also condemned the “violence and lawlessness” that took place. But rather than keep talking about what happened and repeatedly putting “Band-Aids” on problems such as police brutality, Burbank hopes that citizens and lawmakers can take action. “It is now time. We’ve talked about the problem enough. It’s time to move from the issue and violence and solve it so it doesn’t happen tomorrow,” he said. “Stand up and say it’s wrong and stand up and say this is what we’re going to do change it. This is about changing laws so this doesn’t happen again.” Likewise, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill on Monday also called for “all prosecutors and law enforcement leaders (to) take immediate action to address racially biased policing and police use of excessive force.” In a joint statement signed by 40 elected prosecutors from across the nation, including Gill, prosecutors condemned George Floyd’s death, and called for reforms to police departments around the U.S. and the justice system. “Justice, fairness, equality and truth are not mere words but are instead the ideals and promises of a free American society,” Gill said. “Only by working actively to rid our society and systems of structural racism will we be able to meaningfully start down the path of justice for our most alienated brothers and sisters.” Retired Unified Police Chief Chris Bertram, who now works as a private investigator, said he understands the idea of letting people vent their frustrations. But as the protest grew and word got out on social media, he believes police should have responded quicker and then not just “hold the line” when they got there. “I just believe there was a point where you could have got in, moved the crowd, dispersed the crowd with good tactics and it wouldn’t have grown and you wouldn’t have left those static times where there was nothing productive,” he said. “I look at it from a perspective of, Salt Lake City just made the national map. We had to call the National Guard out. We called every police department along the Wasatch Front to provide officers to quell this. Our Capitol was defaced in a way that really really bothers me. Police officers were injured. “I do see that there were things that could have been done earlier on in my opinion, to make sure you didn’t get to where we were.” Brent Jex, head of the Fraternal Order of Police in Utah, said there was a difference on Saturday between “protesters” and “rioters.” Because the city failed to corral the rioters and “anarchists” at the onset, the message of the protesters was lost by the actions of others, he said. But ultimately, he said it’s up to the public to decide whether the city’s response was appropriate or if they waited too long to react. “They implemented a strategy. If property damage and costs is acceptable to Salt Lake City, then OK. If it’s not acceptable, demand accountability,” he said. Once officers from across northern Utah gathered in Salt Lake City and became engaged with the rioters, Jex said police did their jobs well. “I have no problem with how (police) coordinated this once it took effect. They showed great skill,” he said. Soliciting officer complaints? Jex does have a problem, however, with how Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall responded to the aftermath of the riot. On Sunday, the mayor asked for anyone who felt they had been mistreated by police to step forward and file a complaint. Her response may have been prompted by a video that showed a Salt Lake police officer in riot gear knocking over an elderly man with a cane. That man was quickly helped back to his feet by other officers. Brown said the officer who knocked the man down has been taken off of crowd control duties and an internal investigation is underway. Jex said the mayor’s focus, however, should have been on the officers who stood their ground while having rocks, bricks and other items thrown at them. One officer was hit on the head with a baseball bat, being protected only by his helmet. Jex said there were also reports of another officer who had his arm broken with a bat, though as of Monday he did not know the name of the officer or what agency he was from. But Jex said he had personally received calls from officers who had to have stitches after being pelted with rocks. He posted on a picture of one officer who suffered a large gash on his chin. “So many guys hit with bricks,” he said Monday. Because of that, Jex said rather than solicit “the complaints of those rioters,” Mendenhall should be personally thanking the officers who came from across the state to help. “I was at the house of a good friend of mine who took a rock to the face and split his chin open. His uniform is all bloody. But Mayor Mendenall skated right over that like it didn’t happen,” Jex said. “We don’t expect much, but just a thank you is the least she can do.” Jex and the Fraternal Order of Police issued an open letter on Monday, calling her out for what they called her “lack of concern and support.” “To be sure, those in the crowd chanting, ‘The only good cop is a dead cop,’ can probably be relied upon for complaints,” the letter states, while criticizing Mendenhall for not being visible on the street Saturday night. Other officers made social media posts, while withholding their names, talking about the way they were treated by rioters on Saturday. “I am tired of being the bad guy just because I chose to be a cop,” one officer wrote. “Mean people seem to get the loudest voice and their objective/motivation seems to be anger and disruption. I’ve been spit on, hit, shot at, had things thrown at me and had horrible things said to me and my family. I’ve seen a lot of awfulness and kept my cool because I wanted to help people. “My fellow officers are white, black, Hispanic, women, gay, lesbian, and all others. They do the same job I do and many for the same reason. They too are the enemy now just because they are police. I will go out my next shift and be professional, courteous, and look for opportunities to be kind and helpful to the public I swore to protect and serve because I chose to be a cop.” The wife of one officer also felt slighted by the mayor’s response, stating her husband worked 28 straight hours on Saturday into Sunday and was hit in the face by a skateboard. “You don’t see the mayor asking for the public to report anything like this that they might have witnessed. Don’t worry though. The officer is fine. I know because he’s my husband,” the woman wrote. Mendenhall responded to the Fraternal Order of Police letter Monday on KSL Newsradio’s “Dave and Dujanovic” show, apologizing that her message calling for complaints against police officers had been taken that way. She said “if there’s any assertion” that Salt Lake City officials “didn’t want information about the destruction that’s taken place” during the protest, “that is a pretty sad misunderstanding, and I apologize if that’s the way it was taken.” “If there’s any police officer who took my words for criticism against their actions on Saturday night, then I am sincerely sorry,” the mayor said. “My sole intention was and still is to make sure the public knows that Salt Lake City police are here to protect and serve, and our department is willing to hear from the public in the spirit of transparency. “It’s not about taking sides with the protesters or soliciting criticism of our officers,” Mendenhall continued. “It’s about running a department that’s accountable and transparent, and that’s something we’ve always strived to be.” Rather, the mayor said the idea of choosing between transparency and supporting the police department speaks to the larger issue now roiling America. “I want to be very clear,” she added. “The assertion that transparency and accountability is counter to supporting our police is a false choice. It’s really actually at the root of why our nation has erupted in protest. Transparency is the best way to support our officers. I have absolute confidence theSalt Lake City Police Department continues to learn from every mistake, and we are always working to evolve our organization.” Mendenhall praised the officers for doing an “incredible” and “amazing job that night of keeping the peace alongside dozens of other agencies.” “I’ve seen these officers serve our community without hesitation, without complaint, I’ve heard the insults that have been hurled at them and the literal items and objects have have been hurled at them,” she said. “And they continue to strive to serve and protect. I’m incredibly grateful for their professionalism, particularly as we watch what’s unfurled across our nation.” Asked if the Salt Lake City Police Department is racist, Mendenhall said she doesn’t believe so, and the city has processes in place to hold officers accountable. But she said there is “systematic racism in almost every facet of this nation,” from business opportunities, to health care and education. “It is baked into the fabric of this nation, and it’s time that we start unpacking that,” she said. Wharton said the City Council expects to be briefed by Salt Lake police on the protests during the council’s meeting Tuesday. He said it’s not clear how city leaders will act to respond directly to the protests, but he and other council members will likely be looking for any opportunity to make changes in policies or procedures, or perhaps even increase funding for deescalation training. He also said any incidents of inappropriate officer behavior will be reviewed and addressed. “Certainly, whatever we hear tomorrow will not be the last of it,” Wharton said. “I think this is just the beginning of a new series of conversations that may lead to changes in our policies. I hope if there is any opportunity to make those changes that we embrace them and that the community embraces having that dialogue.”",0.0
1622589608,2020-06-01 15:31:23,Weber State professor under investigation for tweets threatening those involved in police protests,https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/06/01/weber-state-professor/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Weber State University will investigate a criminal justice professor who allegedly made several threatening comments about those involved in the nationwide protests this weekend against use of deadly force by police, including a Twitter post about how he would have driven a car into a crowd. The school declined to say Monday if professor Scott Senjo would be put on leave or what the review would include. WSU spokeswoman Allison Barlow Hess said the university is aware of the posts and “looking into the issue.” She added: “Weber State University does not condone violence or threats of violence under any circumstance.” Senjo, who has been at the school since August 2000, did not respond to a request for comment. The account where the comments were posted, @ProfSenjo, is linked to his Weber State email address and the cellphone number listed on his curriculum vitae. One comment from the account was a response to a video of a police car speeding into a crowd of protesters in New York City. That action has been criticized both by the New York police commissioner and mayor, along with those at the demonstration who say they feared being run over. The comment from Senjo’s account said: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” 1 of 12 View Caption (Screenshot) A tweet from the account @ProjSenjo, linked to a Weber State professor.

Tyler Blint-Welsh of the Wall Street Journal said he was hit in the face by New York police officer and pushed to the ground — after showing his press badge. A tweet from the Senjo account told Blint-Welsh that if he were an officer, “you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” Several individuals on Twitter have said that they’ve reported the tweets and the account. And many shared them, too, calling for Senjo to be fired. The demonstrations across the country have come in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed last week after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters have denounced racism and deadly force by law enforcement. And in many cities, including Salt Lake City, the rallies have turned violent. In Utah’s capital, demonstrators overturned a police car and lit it on fire. They also threw rocks at the windows of businesses. Officers responded with rubber bullets and arrests. And the city was put under a strict curfew. Article continues below A tweet from Senjo’s account responded to that curfew, too, which had been instituted by Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. It calls the protesters “disgusting losers” and also attacks Mendenhall. “You got what you deserve, idiot. You arrest them,” it read. Other posts label those demonstrating as “savages and criminals” and “thugs and rioters.” A May 30 post said that some are just “bored from the pandemic lockdown” and looking for “some great stuff for their Instagram followers.” And it suggests that they are paid to be there by billionaire George Soros. The responses came amid retweets of many right-wing conservative figures, including commentator Tomi Lahren and President Donald Trump. Another post attacks U.S Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, with the writer saying he would send her back to Somalia if he were in charge (though she is a naturalized American citizen). Some also applaud that a CNN building in Atlanta was damaged during the protests, and state that if an officer “wants to murder someone, it will happen with a firearm in a dark alley.” On May 31, a post from the account said he wouldn’t “just display firearms,” but suggested a reader come to his neighborhood and “I’ll show you how they work.” One questioned why people weren’t rioting “because 20 blacks kill each other every weekend in Chicago.” And another said, in response to concerns that a woman was hit by a rubber bullet in New York, that “if the woman who got arrested in that park was black, and got shot, gosh maybe she should’ve avoided that park.” In a longer statement later Monday, Weber State said, those ""comments made by our faculty member are hurtful and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University.” The school said it would take appropriate action after a full investigation. It added: “We join with our students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends who found these comments to be abhorrent.” And it advises anyone who needs support to talk to WSU’s assistant vice president for diversity, Adrienne Andrews, at 801-626-7243 or adrienneandrews@weber.edu. Senjo, according to the faculty page, started at Weber State in 2000 as an associate professor in criminal justice. He was promoted to tenured professor in 2008. Generally, getting tenure protects faculty from action against their positions. He has previously taught at California State University, Bakersfield, and Florida Atlantic University. He studied, too, at the University of Utah.",0.0

Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount everyone they've interacted with over several days in order to alert others who may have been exposed, and prevent them from spreading the disease further. But that process, known as contact tracing, relies on people knowing who they’ve been in contact with — a daunting task if they’ve been to a mass gathering. And the process relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government. “These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. “If we do not have that, I worry our capacity to control new outbreaks becomes more limited,” he said. Government officials have been hoping to continue reopening businesses, churches and other organizations after months of stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health experts also hoped that any reopening would be accompanied by widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness from beginning. Over the past week, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned a knee to his neck, have involved thousands of people gathered tightly together in large crowds in more than 20 cities nationwide. It’s unclear if the protests themselves will trigger large new outbreaks. The protests were outside, where infections don’t spread as readily as indoors. Also, many of the protesters were wearing masks, and much of the contact was likely less-hazardous “transient” moments of people moving around, passing each other, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. But, still, experts worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be undermined. In Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19 testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to violent protests. Testing in Minneapolis will be affected because some of the clinics that provide the service have been damaged in the protests, according to a city government spokesperson. Reduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” Schaffner said. And contact tracing, which is only just getting going in several states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or with health departments asking intimate questions about where a person has been and who they've been talking to — and getting full, truthful answers in return. Article continues below “In this current environment which has enhanced or brought forth a mistrust of governmental authority, it might make them disinclined to speak with anyone in government,” Schaffner said. That is especially true in black communities trying to cope with episodes of police violence and longstanding frustrations with how they have been marginalized and mistreated by people who work for government agencies. And those are the communities that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus in the U.S. and most in need of public health measures to help control it. Protests in Salt Lake City that drew several thousand people are a setback for contact tracers already struggling to contain the spread of the coronavirus, said Tair Kiphibane, infectious disease bureau manager for the Salt Lake County Health Department. She became concerned as she watched hundreds of protesters go by her downtown Salt Lake City office Saturday afternoon where she and her staff were working another weekend day after seeing increases in COVID-19 cases last week. She sent contact tracers home three hours early Saturday as protests grew violent near the office. She expects further increases in cases because so many people were close to one another during the protest. Tracing the web of infected people that may have been exposed will be daunting since protesters likely won't have names and phone numbers for many of the people they were around. ""It is going to make it so much harder,"" Kiphibane said. ""It could be anybody. They don't know most of those people ... It is just too many people."" In a press conference Saturday, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington used the term ""contact tracing"" when describing an investigation into arrested protesters there.

Just a week ago, George Floyd, an African-American man, died while in police custody. Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt his entire body weight on Floyd’s neck while fellow officers helped hold Floyd down and another office stood by as a bystander. All four officers were later fired. Chauvin has been charged with third degree murder and manslaughter, although there are conflicting autopsies. This act of police brutality ignited mass protests in almost every major city across the country, and has caused outrage worldwide, echoing the frustrations and oppression of the African American community. Here in Salt Lake City, we witnessed for the first time a protest gone violent. Below is a gallery of images from this weekends protests, at the Capitol building and by the City Library.

But she said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like George Floyd who are killed by police. “As Martin Luther King said, the riot is the language of the unheard. Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" Forty-one people were arrested in Salt Lake City during volatile protests that led to one police car being burned, one officer being seriously injured and the implementation of a curfew, Salt Lake City police said Sunday morning as crews cleaned up streets and scrubbed graffiti from buildings including the state Capitol. Scott attributed the destruction to “shameful, disgusting and lazy activists” who are not members of her group that bans violence and has been diligently working with police to create reform. Her group didn’t organize any part of the Salt Lake City protest, she said, but supports the underlying cause behind the demonstrations going on around the country. Most people peacefully marched, chanted or blew their car horns on Saturday. But some protesters turned to violence and vandalism, setting two cars on fire and attacking police officers, who responded with tear gas. Men carrying rifles stood on top of the wreckage of a burned police car.

Protests were held throughout the country over the death of Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Jeremy Harmon/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP) (Photo: Jeremy Harmon, AP) What was billed as a “car caravan for justice” began with people in vehicles circling the Salt Lake City Police Department with signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” People on foot smashed eggs against the windows of the police station in Salt Lake City. Messages were written on the building that said, “We can’t breathe” along with expletives directed at police. Floyd, a black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. A group called Utah Against Police Brutality, which organized the car caravan part of the protest, said in a statement Sunday on Facebook that demonstrations reflect “what happens when elected officials, police departments, and leaders ignore the constant call for justice in the U.S."" “This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence,” the group said. “This is what happens when they refuse to listen, refuse to reform, refuse to hold officers accountable, and refuse to do what has been asked of them over and over again. This is what happens when police target black and brown people and communities for years with no consequence.” Most of the people were arrested for failure to disperse, while a few were booked on suspicion of breaking a curfew and assault on a police officer, said Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown during a briefing with reporters. He said his agency was working to get more details about the people arrested, including where they live because he believes people from outside Utah came to instigate the violence. A total of 21 police officers received medical care, and one police officer was hit in the back of the head with a bat, Brown said. He said his agency has also identified a man who aimed a bow and arrow at a group of protesters before he was tackled and his car burned and that the incident is being investigated. Brown said the man was pulled from the crowd for his safety because officers saw he was being attacked and didn't learn until later that he had aimed a bow and arrow at protesters. He and Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police. “That was troubling. That was a horrible situation,” Brown said. Brown said his agency has also opened an internal investigation of an officer shown on video pushing an older man to the ground. Mendenhall enacted the curfew — which lasts until 6 a.m. Monday — and Gov. Gary Herbert activated the Utah National Guard after thousands converged on the downtown area Saturday afternoon. The extent and cost of the damage was still being assessed on Sunday, Mendenhall said. The Democratic former city councilwoman who is in her first year as mayor said the protests illustrate deeper societal issues that must be addressed. “We will recover,” Mendenhall said, ""and we will recover coming together to rebuild policies and to address, unearth, unpack the systemic racism that exists in this city and in every city across this nation.” Mendenhall and Brown said they will look into any complaints about how officers handled the situation, but called for an end to violence and destruction. “We cannot have meaningful conversations in a riotous situation,” Brown said.

Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, is calling on Utahns to register to vote in order to create systemic change. Her message comes after violent protests broke out in Salt Lake City Saturday night over the in-custody death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis. Now, she said, it’s time to turn attention to making systemic change to avoid incidents like Floyd’s death. One way to do that? Registering to vote and electing politicians with an eye toward criminal justice reform. — Sonja Hutson Utah’s Black Lives Matter Call For Reform Utah’s Black Lives Matter chapter didn’t plan Saturday’s protest in Salt Lake City, though they did encourage members to support it. But the group’s leader, Lex Scott, doesn’t believe those who destroyed property belong to the organization. At a press conference Sunday, Scott said inciting violence is not the goal of Black Lives Matter. Instead, she said, it’s about opposing police violence. Looking forward, Scott said activists are petitioning federal lawmakers to take up legislation that requires national police reform. The bill includes diversity and de-escalation training as well as creating a civilian review board to investigate police shootings. — Emily Means Salt Lake City Cleanup A day of intense protests through downtown Salt Lake City on Saturday left a wake of graffiti and vandalism as demonstrators spray painted buildings and smashed windows. But by early Sunday morning, the streets had calmed and crews — including a number of volunteers — were out to clean the wreckage. More cleaning efforts are underway Monday, but Mayor Erin Mendenhall said it will still take a few days to fully restore the city. — Jon Reed Congressional Debates Monday Four candidates vying to be the Republican candidate to unseat Utah’s lone congressional Democrat face off in a debate Monday.

Former NFL player Burgess Owens, former radio talk show host Jay Mcfarland, state Rep. Kim Coleman and businessman Trent Christensen will take the stage at noon. — Sonja Hutson The Democratic candidates for Utah’s 1st Congressional District will debate Monday at 3 p.m. Darren Parry and Jamie Cheek are the only Democrats in a primary election for Utah’s congressional races. Parry is the council chair of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation, and Cheek is a licensed vocational rehabilitation counselor. The two qualified for the primary ballot during the state Democratic convention in April. The district’s current Rep. Rob Bishop will vacate the seat when his term ends this year.

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

To see more, visit Fresh Air TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Like so many Americans and people around the world, I was horrified watching the video of the police officer - now charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder - who had his knee on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, keeping the weight on Floyd's neck even after he died. My heart was broken. It was broken again over the weekend as I watched peaceful protests against the death of Floyd and other black men and women who died at the hands of police become violent confrontations in cities around America, including Philadelphia, where I live, and Brooklyn, where I grew up. Philadelphia has been preparing to allow businesses that were closed due to the pandemic to reopen this Friday. Now in the heart of our business and shopping district that also has medical offices, food markets, pharmacies and many apartments, stores have had their windows broken, been looted, some set on fire and destroyed. Just a few days ago, the streets were pretty empty, with people practicing social distancing. By the weekend, in Philly and cities around the country, thousands of people were in the streets, which public health officials fear could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19. We asked Eric Adams to join us because he has insights about this moment from several perspectives. When he was 15, he was arrested and beaten by police. He later became a police officer with the intent of helping to reform the police. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. After serving on the force for 22 years, retiring as a captain, he served in the New York State Senate for seven years. He was elected Brooklyn borough president in 2013 and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn's CEO. Brooklyn has been a pandemic hot spot and the location of large protests, some of which turned violent. Eric Adams, welcome back to FRESH AIR. We're recording this late Sunday afternoon. We don't know what will happen Sunday night. What are your concerns about the actions of the police and the protesters in Brooklyn? ERIC ADAMS: Many levels, Terry. I have mixed emotions. No. 1, I'm extremely excited and pleased to see our young people taking to the streets. Historically, the winds of change, they have always been blown by young adults. Young people are very much a part of the movement. And we're seeing that they are lifting their voices. And so I'm happy to see that, but I'm also concerned because embedded into a righteous movement is a group of well-trained people who - their goal is not police abuse but disruption. They're trained on incendiary devices, how to make them. They're trained on how to agitate. Some of them are carrying firearms. And if we're not careful, they will hijack this righteous movement, and that alarms me and concerns me. GROSS: Who do you think those well-trained people are and who do you think trained them? What do you know about that? ADAMS: It's a combination. Some of them, believe it or not - this strange marriage has been created between right-wing militias who have infiltrated the bodies of some of these movements across our country and even here in New York, and others are those who are just believers that we need to burn down our cities. I know that they had groups here staking out the city to see how police move and where police are located. I've been debriefed on some of the people who have been involved. Like, one car we found in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had several Molotov cocktails and a tank full of gasoline to make incendiary devices. The young lady who pulled up at the 88th Precinct, what happened to have been one of my precincts as an officer, she pulled up and threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle. We're seeing jeeps burned and vans burned. And the young African Americans who are fighting police abuse all across the country, they are doing it in a peaceful fashion. And if we're not careful, those who have infiltrated these peaceful, righteous groups are going to put these young people in a very harmful state. GROSS: What's your reaction, as a former police officer, to seeing police precincts in Brooklyn under attack? I mean, protesters tried to breach and enter a police precinct in Brooklyn, and outside Brooklyn's 88th Precinct, there was another large clash with crowds. What's your reaction to that? Like, how do you think police should be handling it when their precincts come under attack? ADAMS: And that's so important because look at the last series of marches that really put in place serious changes across the country. When you looked at those marches, you did not see people go into the 88th Precinct and other precincts in this city; you saw the organizers, the marches, you saw them stop businesses, stop traffic, maybe stop transportation. They were doing die-ins. They were doing real things to allow their voices to be heard. And that's why we have to ask, what's different here? How did we go from those extremely important ways of being heard to a point that we are actually trying to take over precincts, that we're firebombing vehicles? I was out last night at 1:30 in the morning on Flatbush Avenue and saw the number of businesses that were destroyed. And as I went into Clinton Hill, I saw property owners, people who actually own homes, I saw their homes damaged as well. And so we must make sure that we have the right balance between public protection from our police officers and to weed out those who are damaging what these young people are doing. I've been speaking with the Black Lives Matters organizers of Brooklyn and others who are part of the righteous pursuit to end police brutality to show them how to distance themselves from those who are trying to hijack their movement. GROSS: Would you like to see people from Black Lives Matter speaking out against the violence and distancing themselves from it? ADAMS: Yes, I would. And that is part of the conversation that I've had with some of the leaders. And I understand their concerns because they don't want to give a pathway. Sometimes when you speak out against something, it's manipulated in another fashion, and so they are extremely concerned about that. And we're trying to find a way that they can effectively distance themselves from what they're seeing but, at the same time, keep the focus on the mission of turning around police abuse. But I guess I would like to do that, and that is part of the conversations I've been having with them. GROSS: And let's get back to the police. I know - like, because we talked about this once before on the show - when you were a police officer, there were times when, during the day, you would be joining protesters against police abuse, and then in the evening, you'd be policing the protesters in your job as a police officer. And people would make assumptions about you as an officer, assumptions that were often not true, about where your sympathies lay. So let's talk about policing right now. I suspect that a lot of police officers sympathize with the protesters, yet at the same time, cannot allow violence in their cities. They can't allow the destruction of property, although all of that has happened anyways. Talk a little bit from your perspective as a former police officer what you think the police are up against and the kind of difficult decisions they have to make. ADAMS: That's a great question because - and you're right. The - remember; we recruit police officers from a society that is filled with healthy and toxic individuals. And when you come into the law enforcement arena, many of the individuals who are not suitable to be a police officer, they find root in a culture that really protected even the toxic individuals. The police department - actually, the police departments across America - they have never been good at immediately weeding out those who are not suitable. To have two of the most important rights that a human being can have in a country like America - the right to take freedom and the right to take away one's life - those are rights that not even the president - thank God, with this president - a president doesn't even have. So when you give someone those rights, you need to have an awesome amount of oversight, an awesome amount of obligation, and we have not done that historically. And when you look at the video footage - I've been closely watching the video footage, and I've been - I have intentionally went to many of the protests last night. I was - like I said, I was on Flatbush Avenue watching some of the interaction. When you look at the video footage, there's something that is glaring. There is a body of officers who are really suited to do this type of enforcement, and then there's a body of officers that are really not suited to do it. Now, what do I mean by that? And, Terry, we really need to reexamine how we assign police officers in our country. Everyone who is in the occupation is not suitable for every role in the occupation. There are officers that I, as a platoon commander, I enjoyed having with me when I had to kick in a door to go after someone that was committing a crime, had a gun. But I wouldn't want that same person with me if I was speaking to someone that was trying to talk someone off a ledge or dealing with a hostage situation. And so we don't assign officers based on their abilities to carry out the crafts that are needed in a particular time. Policing basically just brings everyone together. Saying, if you have on a blue uniform, you're suitable to do all the jobs - that is a big mistake, and we need to change that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. He's the borough president of Brooklyn. He's a former New York City police officer who co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which was a police reform group against racial profiling and police assaults. He was also assaulted by the police when he was 15. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams, and we're talking about the protests over the weekend. At age 15, he was beaten by police. And in the hope of helping reform the policing of black people and neighborhoods, he joined the New York City police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator in New York and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn Borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been a site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. It's also been a hot spot in the pandemic. Were you ever, as a police officer, patrolling a protest that turned violent? And if so, what was that like for you? What were some of the most complicated actions and decisions you had to make? ADAMS: Extremely complicated, extremely frightening. Even when you put on a blue uniform, you do not take away the fright and flight hard-wiring inside you. And the goal is I go in with the mindset - or whoever I'm working with, I'm asking them before I start it - as a football team goes into a huddle, I go into a huddle and say, listen; we are our brother's keeper. That was the No. 1 thing I told my officers at several protests. I was here in the midst of many of the stop-and-frisk protests, the Abner Louima protest, the Dorismond protest - some of the real height - and I policed under Giuliani's administration and under Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly. We had protests all the time. What I learned was that if you make sure that the officers know that you are my brother's keeper and if I am going over the edge, if I'm not doing the job the way it's supposed to because my adrenaline is flowing and I am responding instead of being the professional I ought to be, stop me, pause me, pull me to the side, take me, disengage me. And there were times when a person was extremely difficult to deal with - in some cases violent dealing with them - that you have to do the necessary force to terminate the condition. What you're seeing in some of the videos, you're seeing people handcuffed, and officers are still swinging their baton, and no one is stopping them. We're not teaching de-escalation. We teach de-escalation of the person who's committing the act; we're not teaching de-escalation of the officers who are trying to terminate the act. And I always instructed my officers when I was a sergeant, a lieutenant and a captain the skill of de-escalation and being your brother's keeper to prevent an incident getting out of hand. GROSS: We've all seen in times during the protests over the weekend when protesters were intentionally provoking the police - throwing things at them, setting their cars on fire. From your perspective as a former police officer who opposes police brutality, who opposes racial profiling, who opposes these murders of black people, what is the response a police officer should have when they are intentionally being violently provoked? ADAMS: It's so important. And my history - this is my life's work, dealing with police abuse, from being arrested as a young man, being told by civil rights leaders to go into the police department. I'm committed to having effective policing, but I'm also committed to something else. I'm committed to public safety. And in those cases where you see police vehicles being burned, where you see rocks being thrown, those people should be immediately apprehended and arrested. And we have to be swift about it, and we have to be - have a zero-tolerance. So that zero-tolerance of not allowing police to be abusive must also be a zero-tolerance not to allow people to attack police because that uniform is not the person in the uniform; it's the symbol of our stability. I know it has been a symbol of pain, but it also has been a symbol of the stability of this country and this city. And we need to reform it, but we can never tear down that stability that we use. So I don't go - I'm not part of that group that says disband the police departments. I'm not part of that group that says we can live in a society with no police at all. You do need some form of law and order and not unlawfulness and disorder. GROSS: Let's talk about what happened to you when you were 15 and that - how that affected your view of the police. I mean, you had been charged with trespassing. Just give us a brief sense of what the charge was. ADAMS: I was a 15-year-old child. I grew up - part of my childhood was in Bayside High School, when I left Brooklyn before returning. And my brother and I, we were arrested for criminal trespassing. Once the officers took us to the precinct - they picked us up from school, took us to the precinct. And they were filling out the paperwork, and out of nowhere, they said, you feel like a beat down? And they brought the two of us - we thought we were being transported somewhere. But they took us to the lower part of the 103rd Precinct, the same precinct Sean Bell was killed in. And they just started kicking us in the groin, you know, repeatedly. It was unbelievable. I remember acting like I passed out to get them to stop. The pain was just excruciating, if you can only imagine. And we - you know, I know I urinated blood for a week after that. And I remember every day saying to myself, Terry, that, you know, I'm going to tell my mother if it doesn't stop after the next day, the next day. And eventually, it concluded. And we never talked about that, my brother and I, until we were adults. And I think until this day, he still is suffering from mental health illness because of that because I experience PTSD. I could not see a police car go by without reliving that moment. I could not see a police show on TV. Every time I heard a siren - can you imagine just having that part of the wiring in your brain? And I think oftentimes police officers that have bad intentions do that to young people to - almost like slave masters used to do horrific things to instill fear into slaves. And it wasn't until after Randolph Evans was shot and killed that a group of leaders in Brooklyn from the Black United Front told me and 13 others to go into law enforcement. I didn't want to do that. I was a computer programmer. I wanted to open my own firm and become Cisco qualified. But I felt obligated, and it really was a life-changing experience for me, and it allowed me to turn that pain into purpose. And you know what? I finally found the refuge I needed, that I no longer felt the trauma from that beating. I felt as though that demasculation (ph) was behind me because I was using that pain in a way of turning around the lives of people. GROSS: So you're in a position of understanding the pain that a lot of black people feel when they think about the police. Were police ever a good force in your life before you became an officer? Did they ever help you or protect you? ADAMS: No. And it's unfortunate that there was always this adversarial relationship with law enforcement. And remember - you know, you don't call the police in South Jamaica, Queens, or Brownsville or East New York to invite them to a party; you call them when someone shot up the party. So when you have a relationship with an entity in your community that is only built on when there is something terribly wrong, you begin to associate pain with the profession. And so that is why proactive policing is so important in changing - how we utilize our law enforcement community is so important because I didn't have those good stories that some of my colleagues - when I attended Bayside High School and I used to hear - some of the students in the class talked about the good things they did, you know, with the police, how some of them were in the Boy Scouts or was part of the DARE program and just these interactions. And I was like, what are you talking about? They're cops. Who - (laughter) you know, who has these relationships with cops? And it was difficult because there was nothing, no point of reference of the beauty of having a good relationship with your law enforcement in your community. GROSS: My guest is Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. He now serves as Brooklyn bureau president. We'll talk more after a break. And then later, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel, the bestseller ""The Mothers,"" was optioned by Kerry Washington. And David Bianculli will review three TV shows, one from the new streaming service HBO Max. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DARRELL GRANT'S ""FILS DU SOLEIL (FOR TONY WILLIAMS)"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. At age 15, he was beaten by police. In the hope of helping reform the policing of black neighborhoods, he joined the New York City Police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been the site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. Brooklyn is also a hotspot for the pandemic. You know, I really do think there's a lot of police officers around the country who are really angry and really furious about what happened to George Floyd. And they're probably suffering too because now they're out on the streets in the middle of a pandemic fighting with people that they don't want to be in confrontation with. What do you think police can do or should do to show their anger at police who behave badly or brutally, or who are, you know, responsible for the deaths of people? ADAMS: We have to really change the culture of policing. We have police here in the city that put up a white power finger sign. And all the other police officers started cheering and laughing with them. When you have some of the actions of - we almost have to rebuild our law enforcement community because the recruitment effort we did, we focus on law enforcement, again, and not on how we deal with social issues - and build this symbiotic relationship between our policing community. And then you have to change the culture of really supporting a climate, a healthy climate, where an officer could come forward and report abuse without any form of reprisal. We must refocus and revamp police. And I think this is an opportunity to do so, as we saw in New Jersey some of the police chiefs marching with some of the demonstrators. And something else happened with the Floyd case that some people may have overlooked - it was a significant moment - one, the expeditious fashion in which the police officer was fired, second, how fast the prosecutor indicted. Now, the indictment itself is troubling to me, which is another conversation. But they moved quickly. The third - the other officers were fired. They should also be arrested. But the mere fact they were fired was a cosmic shift in policing, because the tone is now set that your actions will also - you're responsible for not only for your actions, but the actions of the person who you are near. Standing around watching someone choke to death, you should be held accountable the same way as someone participated in a robbery. They acted in concert. That is how we should treat those officers that are carrying out these actions. GROSS: I know a lot of people would agree with you that there's been, you know, progress made in how fast these actions were taken. But that doesn't seem to have had any effect on the protests. ADAMS: And it shouldn't. We have to keep the pressure on. We have a long way to go. And I am - as I stated, I'm excited about these protests because it is as though I've come full circle. I've marched in these protests when we were fighting against stop-and-frisk. I remember looking beside me and seeing these different ethnic groups who peacefully joined with me. I recall that the - in the protests, as you indicated, taking off my jeans and shirt and putting on my police uniforms and feeling as though my day was fulfilled. I felt accomplished. I felt as though I was able to protect the city and, at the same time, force them to allow our police agencies to become who and what they are. And I think these protests play a significant role, because let's face it, a absence of the Dr. Kings, the SNCCs, the Rosa Parks and so many others, America would not have moved in the area that it should have moved. We would've never signed civil rights bills. We would have never done some of the things that we did. If it wasn't for the women's suffrage movement, we would still probably not have women voting. Hitting the streets and showing you're outraged and not comfortable is something that's part of America as apple pie and Chevrolet. And we need to continue to hit the streets to move America where it ought to go. GROSS: Right now, given how hot the situation is, do you want to see people continuing to hit the streets? ADAMS: It's a very delicate balance. I'm really afraid about the COVID-19. As you know, I spent the last 50-plus days sleeping in my office from the time that COVID hit the shores here in New York City. And what we have done around this issue - and the same communities that are dealing with police abuse are the communities that were negatively impacted disproportionately by coronavirus. And so I'm afraid that many of our young people are going to take the infection home to their loved ones, their seniors, their grandmothers. And it is a true concern. And when I saw people participating in the protest, I did see some who were wearing face mask. But clearly, an overwhelming number of them were not practicing social distancing. I am concerned that, you know, body fluids, being in close proximity is going to have family members that are going to be infected. Young people who are going to leave the protests and go home, they are going to infect their loved ones. And COVID virus is serious, is real. And the same communities that are dealing with police abuse were disproportionately impacted by the lack of government response to coronavirus. GROSS: I'm obviously really worried about that, too. And, you know, Brooklyn has been a pandemic hotspot. And, you know, in Philly, Philly's preparing to reopen on Friday. Philly was preparing to go yellow. And now, like, who knows what the consequences for the pandemic will be from all the protests over the weekend? And I'm sure that's true for many cities. Like, we know what happened in New Orleans after Mardi Gras. And this was not a celebratory parade. These were protests. But it's still, in terms of the virus, it can have the same impact of thousands of people in the streets, shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of them were wearing masks. But at that close proximity, you know, who knows? How much of a setback do you fear this will be for Brooklyn, where you are the Brooklyn borough president? ADAMS: I think it's going to be a significant setback. But what I've learned - I recall after 9/11. And when the Trade Center was attacked and the buildings collapsed, I remember going out to Brownsville, a predominately black community, to talk to the young people and deal with the trauma of the buildings collapsing. And they were playing basketball and just hanging out. And I've told them, did you hear what happened? They said, Eric, we were catching hell when those buildings were up. We didn't have heat at night. We had lead paint. Crime was high. We were unemployed. Those buildings have nothing to do with us. People can feel so much pain that they become numb to the reality of danger. And I think that's what you're seeing here. Many of these young people have been living in a state of just total hopelessness and don't feel as though another level of trauma is going to do anything to dissipate the trauma that they're experiencing already. And somehow, we have to convince them that life is not about being hopeless, but about being empowered. And while we do that, we have to understand that that is why they are in the streets, not because they want to expose themselves to coronavirus. But they've reached a level of desperation where they're no longer believing society's ability to protect them from a virus or from the virus or police abuse. GROSS: Were you glad over the weekend that you are no longer a police officer? ADAMS: No, not at all. I looked forward to being in the eye of the storm. I looked forward to those difficult days when I had to talk someone down from showing a level of anger and understanding what they felt. I was the type of person that I wanted to be the platoon commander that was inside of - in charge of the detail that went out. I knew we were going to allow officers to come back safely. And I knew that the protesters were going to get home safe. And that's the type of leadership we need right now. And I think that in the police department, we have some amazing men and women who have taken upon this occupation. We need to start rewarding them for their commitment - and not only looking at how good they are at fighting crime, but how good they are at building relationships within the community. GROSS: Eric Adams, thank you so much for talking with us. And I hope Brooklyn comes through all of this OK. ADAMS: OK. Be well. GROSS: Eric Adams is the Brooklyn borough president and a former NYPD police captain. He co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. After we take a short break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel was the bestseller ""The Mothers."" This is FRESH AIR.

1622664287,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.kuer.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

In one, a white woman in New York called 911, telling the dispatcher that “an African-American male is threatening my life!” when what he had really done is ask her to put her dog on a leash. In the other, a white cop in the Minneapolis Police Department killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, even as the latter implored, “I can’t breathe!” Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder, at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, saw these videos. He also saw the subsequent footage of protests spreading throughout the nation (some peaceful, some riotous); the images of looters destroying property; of cops resorting to force and at times inflaming the situation; and of people of color telling stories of decades of racism and mistreatment and oppression. “I needed to have my awareness raised, frankly,” he said Monday on the podcast hosted by ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski. Snyder’s colleague, Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, organized a conference call among the NBA’s 30 head coaches over the weekend. The goal was to devise a plan of action, to determine a way in which they could use their platform to accomplish some good. Snyder, who would wind up joining the National Basketball Coaches Association’s Committee on Racial Injustice and Reform, recalled listening to his black fellow coaches and coming away realizing how much more he could do, how much more he needed to do. “As a white man, what I was hearing was, ‘We need help.’ And ultimately it’s not enough to just have support, there has to be a willingness to confront these things when you see them. Be willing to take action,” Snyder told Wojnarowski. Pierce mentioned on the podcast how the bond between NBA players and coaches may be closer than it is in other sports owing to the relatively small roster sizes. Relationships typically can’t help but be closer. “If a player comes to you and tells you, you know, ‘My aunt has cancer,’ you can't stop thinking about it,” Pierce said. “You can't stop thinking about what your player is going through.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: America's police officers are at the center of a national storm. They are hearing the rage over what happened to George Floyd at the same time they've been tasked with containing the violence. Some have been accused of cracking down on legitimate protesters, others criticized for being too permissive toward vandals and looters. To give us a sense of what the nation's police officers are thinking right now, we're joined by NPR's law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste, who's been talking with his police sources today. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: First, just give us a sense of the mood of the police officers that you're talking to. KASTE: The mood is gloomy. It's tense. And I think it's fair to say that there is some fear I've heard in some of the things I've heard from especially officers who are kind of on the front lines of crowd control and scenes we've seen so much in the last couple of days. There's also kind of a sense of frustration for a lot of officers when they hear what they think - what they perceive to be sort of a note of understanding or the sense that it's acceptable that this kind of violence, this looting and arson accompany these protests - they find that kind of frustrating. SHAPIRO: Are they angry just about the violence or also about the public response condemning the Minneapolis police involved in the death of George Floyd or, in some cases, about the actions of police officers that, you know, wear the badge as well? KASTE: Well, this anger I was talking about is about this violence. To be clear, when it comes to Minneapolis cops in that video, the police - it's actually struck me how unanimous they've been in condemning - from early on, from last week - condemning what they saw in that video. I've heard cops just going off on those Minneapolis police officers, saying they've made it so much harder to be a police officer in this country now. And you know, I was talking about this yesterday with Robert Hollis, who's a police patrol commander in Kent, Wash., which is a very diverse suburb of Seattle. And he told me that as a black man, he felt sick to his stomach watching that video of Floyd. But he also saw some reason for hope in this sort of widespread condemnation he was hearing from this world of policing. ROBERT HOLLIS: Numerous unions, numerous police chiefs are coming out and saying, this is not the type of officer that we want - 'cause I guarantee you five years ago, it would be more of a, let's wait and see what's going on. Let's hold off, wait for all the facts to come out. But this time, it was outcry from the get-go. SHAPIRO: And as an African American police officer, what is his take on the protesters' accusation that the police are inherently racist, that there are unfortunate trends and, you know, that it run through the institution? KASTE: Well, I mean, he took a nuanced approach to this when we were talking about it. You know, he said that policing, by its very nature, changes slowly. But he thinks, also, that in his 19 years as an officer, he has seen substantive improvements. One example he gave is his own department. A few years ago, they still permitted that knee-to-the-neck technique that we saw used on George Floyd. But a few years ago, a trainer said, this is dangerous. And the department banned it. And he also thinks the implicit bias training of just the last few years, the last five or six years has kind of shaped the views of the new generation of leaders inside of police departments, which may be behind this sort of unanimous condemnation we're hearing. But he still said that he understands that when people see something like this case with George Floyd, that they say, if one of you did it, you all did it. HOLLIS: I don't blame them. At the same time, I still would say to those community members, you need to keep working with us, and we want to keep - continue to keep working with you because we recognize that there's a need to change. We're doing our best to try and make those changes. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Martin, as somebody who's been covering these issues since before Ferguson, do you see the same kind of gradual improvement that Commander Hollis is describing? KASTE: There have definitely been policy changes. There's been sort of a change in attitude in departments on how use of force is used and documented. But you know, policing is a patchwork in this country. There's some talk now about changing the rules under which police can be sued. SHAPIRO: OK. KASTE: That's something that Congress is now maybe picking up the next few days. That might be something that unites left and right. SHAPIRO: NPR's Martin Kaste, thank you. KASTE: You're welcome.

GEORGE, Utah (ABC4 News) – In contrast to the violent and destructive riots that occurred in Salt Lake City this weekend, officials say the protests in Southern Utah remained relatively peaceful. But Troy Anderson, founder of the newly-established Southern Utah chapter of Black Lives Matter, tells ABC4 News there is much more the community can learn about systemic racism in collaboration with local police and city leaders. RELATED: ABC4 News captures police officer armed in protest gear pushing down man with cane Addressing dozens who gathered to kneel in protest at the St. George City offices, Anderson called on police in Southern Utah to curb unwarranted arrests and traffic stops he believes may have been racially motivated. “To some degree we’re all enablers of the system, and I think that’s where we have to start: looking at ourselves,” Anderson said. St. George Police Officer Tiffany Atkin tells ABC4 News that all law enforcement in the community want an open dialogue and ask that anyone with concerns of racial injustices please reach out. RELATED: Black Lives Matter Utah drafts national police reform bill after George Floyd’s death Atkin said her department is thankful that locals protested peacefully. “The community doesn’t want to burn this city down and they don’t want people hurt,” Atkin said. “Rather than focus on Antifa or some other, I want to focus on the fact that we live in a great community with great people who may feel frustrated but are going about it the right away.” Utah Black Lives Matter representatives say they do not condone violence. Anderson said he believes the public’s focus on the destruction and looting has become a deflection of the underlying issues marginalized groups are facing and the pain they feel. “Our country is not gonna thrive or survive if we keep living in a system that is based on white supremacy,” Anderson said. City leaders in Southern Utah said they’re ready to move the conversation forward and discuss what the chapter feels will be necessary to improve conditions for marginalized communities, whether that involves more advanced training of law enforcement or learning within the community. “I thought the protests went very well over the weekend here in St. George,” St. George Mayor Jon Pike said. “Those participating were respectful and no laws were broken.” Pike added, “I felt that it was important for me to go out there and listen to those who may be feeling frustrated and commend them for protesting and demonstrating peacefully. People want their voices heard.”",0.0
1622684105,2020-06-01 17:57:26,President Nelson: ‘Deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life’,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2020/6/1/21277362/president-nelson-facebook-post-social-media-racism-violence-latter-day-saints-naacp,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"SALT LAKE CITY — In a social media post on Monday afternoon, President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said church leaders are saddened by recent evidences of racism and “abhor the reality that some would deny others respect.” The message also addressed the violence and rioting that took place over the weekend connected to protests of the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer who since has been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter, knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while restraining him on May 25. President Nelson’s entire post said: “We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin. “We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest. “The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent! “During the Savior’s earthly mission, He constantly ministered to those who were excluded, marginalized, judged, overlooked, abused, and discounted. As his followers, can we do anything less? The answer is no! We believe in freedom, kindness and fairness for all of God’s children! “Let us be clear. We are brothers and sisters, each of us the child of a loving Father in Heaven. His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, invites all to come unto him—“black and white, bond and free, male and female.” It behooves each of us to do whatever we can in our spheres of influence to preserve the dignity and respect every son and daughter of God deserves. “Any nation can only be as great as its people. That requires citizens to cultivate a moral compass that helps them distinguish between right and wrong. “Illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil. “We need to foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. “We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed or cause. “And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation. “I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children.” President Nelson has worked on racial issues with American black leaders since early in his administration. In May 2018, five months after he became the church’s president and prophet, President Nelson stood with the senior leaders of the NAACP to issue a joint call for racial harmony. “Today, in unity with such capable and impressive leaders as the national officials of the NAACP,” he said then, “we are impressed to call on people of this nation, and indeed, the entire world, to demonstrate greater civility, racial and ethnic harmony and mutual respect.” Since then, President Nelson and NAACP President Derrick Johnson, Chairman Leon Russell and Vice Chairwoman Karen Boykin-Towns have nurtured ongoing relationships that have led to a unique NAACP/Latter-day Saint partnership that customizes the church’s self-reliance programs to help economically disadvantaged blacks in some of America’s largest cities. President Nelson spoke to the NAACP’s 2019 national convention, declaring “We want to become dear friends.” President Nelson and the Rev. Amos Brown, chairman of the NAACP’s religious affairs committee, have become particularly close. Brown introduced President Nelson to the convention as “a brother of another mother,” as seen in a Church News video. NAACP board member Theresa Dear has written a series of guest opinion columns for the Deseret News, including one published on Saturday about George Floyd’s death.",0.0

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/02/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley.

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Nelson shared a message on his social media accounts Monday afternoon following protests across the world regarding the death of George Floyd. The post reads: We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin. We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest. The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent! During the Savior’s earthly mission, He constantly ministered to those who were excluded, marginalized, judged, overlooked, abused, and discounted. As His followers, can we do anything less? The answer is no! We believe in freedom, kindness, and fairness for all of God’s children! Let us be clear. We are brothers and sisters, each of us the child of a loving Father in Heaven. His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, invites all to come unto Him — “black and white, bond and free, male and female,” (2 Nephi 26:33). It behooves each of us to do whatever we can in our spheres of influence to preserve the dignity and respect every son and daughter of God deserves. Any nation can only be as great as its people. That requires citizens to cultivate a moral compass that helps them distinguish between right and wrong. Illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil. We need to foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause. And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation. I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect, and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children. The post was shared some 13,000 times on Facebook in one hour.",0.0

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

In the face of anger and anguish in the streets, it can be easy to fixate on the unrest itself. What might it mean for me or for my place of work? How far could potential unrest or violence spread? In such times, order can feel more pressing than justice. Social order and social harmony, however, both ultimately depend on a recognition of the root causes that lie beneath the confrontations playing out in news reports and on social media. To consider the unrest but not its sources is to mistake symptom for disease. As horrifying footage has again unmistakably revealed yet another black or brown life snuffed out by someone sworn to protect and serve, the disease is similarly exposed. The problem is racism. If one has never personally experienced the indignity and trauma of racial prejudice, it can be difficult to see it as anything other than a lingering vestige of a bygone era that flares only when an isolated, unenlightened bad actor acts out. Without personal experiences across a lifetime, it can be difficult to discern the ways racism is woven into the fabric of American social, economic and political life. Historical and social scientific studies continue to document the racialized ways that everything from lending and zoning, to law enforcement, housing and to education have developed in this country. This avalanche of scholarship shows these inequities to have deep roots in our past and to have persisted to the present. Even so, it can be difficult to sense the weight of this reality from books. It often takes more personal connections — more intimate proximity, as author and activist Bryan Stevenson told a BYU audience in 2018 — for the costs of racism to become real for those who don’t live with such burdens daily. Significantly, progress on racial matters has come in the U.S. only when multiracial coalitions act together, motivated by convictions about the moral rightness of racial justice. These coalitions and moral convictions have regularly drawn on religious traditions and religious language. Religious leaders of varied racial backgrounds have lent their moral authority to the cause of racial justice. As a historian and devoted Latter-day Saint, it is not difficult for me to discern God’s hand in the black freedom struggle. In many ways, it is a sacred history to me. Contemporary Latter-day Saint practice offers a unique opportunity to white saints in the United States, our own difficult history of racial restriction notwithstanding. Indeed, that very history provides the impetus for special striving in vexed moments like ours. That is, despite a long history of forced and chosen racial segregation in American Christian congregations, because of our geographically-determined ward system, ours usually are racially integrated. In other words, intimate proximity is a practical necessity in congregations that value our tradition’s call for unified Zion-building. But because Saints of color are often minorities in their congregations, too frequently the price of admission for them has meant that they must leave their anger or anguish over racial injustice outside the congregational circle. When the communal pain of black Americans overflows, it is time for white folks to listen more intently. But what, in times like this, might our covenantal obligations to “bear one another’s burdens” and to “mourn with those who mourn” mean for white Saints in relation to our sisters and brothers of color? Authentic communion at the congregational level surely means making space for the burdens that come with our national history of racial injustice. Is there any hope for congregations of “one heart and one mind” if segments of Christ’s body cannot speak their pain or their anger at the persistent inequities that have long defined this national crisis? Surely membership in our covenant community requires more from us than comfortable obliviousness to the realities of our neighbors’ lives. Such a weighty history of American racism and its effects on our fellow Saints must demand our attention. When the communal pain of black Americans overflows, it is time for white folks to listen more intently. And when one member of Christ’s body suffers, our covenants can provide a kind of spiritual “muscle memory.” They can help us know what to do. But, as is always the case with the heavy work of redemption, the stretching involved, the deep listening demanded, and the hard truths to be faced all beckon us outside our comfort zones. The good news, though, as ever, is that new forms of community and holiness await on the other side of the struggle. J. Spencer Fluhman is executive director of Brigham Young University’s Neal A.

Ben McAdams, sparred during their first debate Monday over issues including the city’s response to a protest that turned violent and how the COVID-19 pandemic is being handled. State Rep. Kim Coleman, R-West Jordan; former NFL player Burgess Owens; former KSL Newsradio host Jay Mcfarland; and nonprofit CEO Trent Christensen said little about McAdams during the hourlong debate held without an audience in the PBS Utah studios at the University of Utah. The candidates did, however, offer different views about how far government should go, starting with Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s decision to issue a curfew Saturday that lasted until Monday morning in the wake of riots against the death of a man at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. Coleman said the daytime curfew was apparently unique to Utah, and compared it to some of the government restrictions put into place to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, She said no matter what crisis, people should stand up for their rights. “People have asked me frequently, ‘Can the government do this to me? Can they tell me I have to stay in my home, shut my business down? Can they really put out a hotline to snitch on your neighbors?’ And I say, ‘Yes, yes they can. If we let them,’” Coleman said. Mcfarland, though, said there are times when personal liberties need to be rescinded briefly “to save lives, to save businesses. That’s what happened in Salt Lake. That’s what mayors and governors have been trying to balance throughout this country. The Constitution is not a death sentence.” Christensen, who had praised Mendenall for being able to “bring the temperature down” and said the media was vilifying the police, jumped in. “I don’t think there is ever a time when you are allowed to rescind personal liberties — ever,” he said, adding that he believes the curfew was constitutional. “We had inciters that were screaming and flipping over police cars and torching police cars and someone with a crossbow. Those people need to be stopped.” Owens said for there to be a such a protest in Utah, “somebody had to come in and get it done. I think in the most part, we cut it down pretty quickly.” But he said mayors must recognize what he described as the socialist “enemy” behind the violent turn taken at protests around the country against the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. “There’s no question, this is wrong. There’s no debate about the heinous act that was done. The problem comes down to the response,” Owens said, blaming what he called a false “narrative that the leftists are giving, that we are such a divided, hateful country” for turning conflicts between blacks and police into national issues. The candidates also split over dealing with the deadly coronavirus, with only Mcfarland saying he regularly wears a mask in public. “I don’t understand who’s making you wear a mask,” Mcfarland said, adding, “Nobody has a gun to your head. Part of exercising personal liberty is to do so responsibly. What happened to love thy neighbor? What happened to civil respect for other people? I wear a mask when I’m in public for that reason.” Christensen said he would wear a masked if asked to at a business, “but I believe it’s a choice. I don’t have a problem with masks. What I do have a problem with is being told I have to wear a mask. That’s not how we do things in America.” He said the same would be true if a vaccine for the virus becomes available. Coleman said she doesn’t “generally wear a mask in public but I do try to honor and respect the distancing.” Owens said he doesn’t wear a mask, citing what he described as “conflicted information that’s not good for our country.” As for additional federal stimulus to counter the economic impacts of COVID-19, Christensen said he would support it going only to states that have reopened “100% as of June 15. And the states that aren’t open on June 15, they don’t get that money. ... We have to give a carrot and a stick approach.” Coleman suggested suspending payroll taxes through the end of the year, which she said would amount to a 7% pay increase for most people. Mcfarland said more needs to be done quickly for employers and employees to keep the country out of another Great Depression while Owens said Democrats are holding the country hostage. The candidates also jostled over who was best to take on McAdams, recently named the 10th-most vulnerable member of Congress seeking reelection. The former Salt Lake County mayor won the seat in 2018 from Republican Rep. Mia Love by less than 700 votes and does not have a primary opponent. Mcfarland said he’s a moderate who can compete in a district that chose a moderate Democrat two years ago in McAdams. “What makes you think that suddenly they’re going to chose an extreme conservative? They’re not. They’re going to look for a moderate to represent them,” he said. “That’s who I am.” Owens described himself as the only Republican in his family and someone who would never “negotiate or compromise with anyone who hates my country because they have a totally different end game.” He said he hopes to be part of a new group of “patriots” who wrest control away from Democrats in the House. Christensen, who helped now Utah Sen. Mitt Romney raise money for his 2012 presidential bid, said Republicans should be focused on getting people back to work.

1622733362,2020-06-01 19:23:29,"Trump declares he’s president of law and order, threatens to deploy military amid protests",https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/6/1/21277568/trump-military-declares-president-law-order-amid-protests,en,True,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"WASHINGTON — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation braced for another round of violence at a time when the country is already buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention not seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and the Minneapolis death of George Floyd. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. In New York, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said she won’t send in National Guard troops to help quell violent protests in Portland because they aren’t needed. Brown said she would send in 100 state police from across Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard soldiers to work behind the scenes. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. The official autopsy said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire and looting, according to an FBI affidavit. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

In their past several years of activism, Lex Scott and Jacarri Kelley have not seen a demonstration in downtown Salt Lake City quite like the one on Saturday. RELATED: Black Lives Matter Utah drafts national police reform bill after George Floyd’s death “We have not seen people care about Black lives as much as they cared about damage to buildings over the weekend. We saw a crowd of thousands of people, but we have not seen those thousands of people attend our police reform meetings. You can replace a building, you can never bring back George Floyd,” said Scott, the organizer of Black Lives Matter Utah. RELATED: Social media gone dark? The meaning of #blackoutTuesday The event was originally planned as a peaceful car caravan protest with a designated route by Utah Against Police Brutality. Organizers said more people showed up than anticipated, some with intentions to sabotage their main message. “I know those organizers. They have protested peacefully for six years and they have never incited violence or destroyed property and the blame is being laid on them as well,” said Scott. Some demonstrators sprayed graffiti or yelled the words “Black Lives Matter” as they caused damaged to the city, leading Scott and Kelley to reiterate that their groups do not condone violence or destruction to property. They encourage new activists to channel their passion into efforts that will actually lead towards progress and change. PHOTOS: Thousands protest George Floyd’s death in Salt Lake City “If your activism only consists of destruction and not building, that is not activism. That is not what this movement is about. Every person I see destroying something or setting something on fire, I’m going to ask what you have actually done for Black Lives Matter,” said Scott. She added, “We have been non-violent and we will continue to be non-violent. If we catch any members destroying property or inciting violence, they will be removed from the chapter and I will testify against them myself. It is upsetting that we are being blamed for violence by people who have not put in the work while we have worked peacefully for six years for police reform.” Kelley’s organization, the Northern Utah Black Lives Matter chapter successfully held a peaceful protest in Ogden, despite tips to police that white national groups would try to interfere. “The Ogden Police Department confirmed it and that’s why there was so much police presence at our protest,” said Kelley. “I commend them for doing their job beautifully and protecting our right for freedom of speech. If they weren’t there, it could’ve ended up like Salt Lake.” But organizers said they still feel like their main message has been overshadowed by the injuries and damage caused in Salt Lake City. Scott and Kelley said their objective is to urge lawmakers in Washington D.C. to pass nationwide police reform. Scott has drafted a bill and started a petition that’s reached its goal of 100,000 signatures as of Monday evening. “We need this bill passed yesterday. We need it right now,” she said. The bill includes the establishment of a comprehensive data collection system, requirement of implicit bias, de-escalation, and diversity training for every police department, stricter policies on the use of deadly force, the development of independent agencies to investigate officer-involved shootings, and regulations of body cameras. “We’re not against police officers by any means. The good ones. But we need those good ones to hold the bad ones accountable and we need our police department to be transparent,” said Kelley. She went on to say, “It’s OK for police officers to say Black Lives Matter. It’s not saying that their lives don’t matter. They’re saying that we understand your pain. We understand your frustration. We understand your heart skips when your kid walks out of the house everyday.” To view Scott’s petition, click here.",0.0

Damage and vandalism, he says, could be found on a 7-11, the State Capitol, City Creek Mall and the police station, among other locations. He says he supports peaceful protests — and the causes around George Floyd’s death that brought so many people downtown — but not the violence.

As police lined up in riot gear, more than 1,000 protesters crowded onto the plaza in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building and eventually began asking police to join them on their knees. Salt Lake police officer Metui Tautuaa didn’t plan on taking a knee with the passionate crowd Monday night. But when the group loudly chanted, “Kneel with us! Kneel with us!” he said he was moved to join them. “They asked. They want to see us participating with them. I’ll give them what they want. As long as it makes them so they stay peaceful, so we don’t have to take any action, that’s what I want. I don’t want anybody being hurt today,” Tautuaa told the Deseret News. The crowd had chanted outside police headquarters for about 15 minutes before the officer took the knee, which led to a number of protesters thanking or shaking hands with other officers. Tautuaa said lining up for a showdown with protesters Monday after working Saturday night was difficult. “Absolutely hard,” he said, adding that the killing of Ogden police officer Nate Lyday last week has made the past few days very emotional. “Extremely. For those Ogden guys to come down on Saturday, that’s huge,” he said, referring to some Ogden police officers who drove to Salt Lake City to help during the riots. “I can’t thank everybody, all the other departments that came down, I can’t thank them enough. I may not have gone home Saturday night without them.” The organizers of Monday night’s rally wanted to make sure city and police leadership understood that they still feel passionately about advocating for change, even if they respected the weekend curfew. “We decided that we wanted to keep the ball rolling, in terms of letting the government know here locally and nationally that we’re not going to stand back and fear,” said Moira Turner of the protest that was organized on Sunday night. “We want to keep the energy ongoing throughout the nation, and really let people know that we’re not going to settle for a little bit of a concession ... when the nation is locked down and brutalized.” Deja Gaston led the protest, introducing different speakers, including one man who lost his brother to an officer-involved shooting. In a moving moment, he read the names of at least a half dozen people who’d been killed in confrontations with Utah police officers. After the speakers, the crowd chanted almost continuously. Those chants included the call-response of “No justice, no peace, no racist police,” “Stand up, fight back”, “Whose streets, our streets” and “When people of color are under attack what do we do? Fight back!” Salaam Muhammad, 24, was emotional as she left with two friends, and explained that she is protesting the same things her mother protested 40 years ago. “Just to peacefully protest,” said Muhammad, who is African American. “I wanted unity and everything. I see that both sides are angry, both sides are scared. You know they say you got two sides fighting, thinking they’re fighting for the right reasons. They’re not going to stop.” She was among those chanting for officers to join them on their knees, a sign of solidarity with those like George Floyd, who died at the hands of police officers. “That man, he knelt down for us,” she said of the officer. “However, we’re angry and some feel that’s not enough.” She said she understands that he won’t leave the officers he sees as “brothers” to join them, but she still feels some comfort in the fact that he would take a moment to show them he empathizes with them. The protesters, most wearing masks, first gathered at Washington Square Monday night and then began walking toward the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building, where Saturday’s protests began, and to other downtown areas. After the officer knelt with protesters, many took a moment to shake the hand of officers or thank them, while others remained agitated. Most people left or headed back to Washington Square, but some moved to 400 South and 300 East where three National Guard Humvees were parked. Some protesters confronted soldiers, and eventually police in riot gear and carrying shields, came and stood with the soldiers. While organizers begged people to return to Washington Square, about 100 people stayed, some talking, some being confrontational and insulting to officers and soldiers. U. student Seth Gardner came to Monday’s protest with a group of friends and said he was worried about attending after what he saw on TV from Saturday’s protests, but wanted to make his voice heard. “We’re not here to riot or cause trouble,” Gardner said. “We want things to change. ... The cops are out of hand and people are dying.” Gardner said he did not see the officer who took a knee with protesters in front of police headquarters Monday night but said, “Every one of those cops should have done it.” After a weekend protest brought chaos and violence to the streets of Utah’s capital amid nationwide outrage over the death of George Floyd, Salt Lake City’s mayor issued a citywide curfew beginning Monday night to last the entire week. The curfew, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Police Chief Mike Brown announced Monday evening, begins at 8 p.m. each night and will end at 6 a.m. each morning until June 8. Some protesters left after the 8 p.m. curfew, but most remained and many continued to protest by walking to the state Capitol, where they were met with dozens of state troopers. Gaston, of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said she didn’t expect to see so many people show up. She and others worried that many people would be scared to protest after Saturday’s violence. “I definitely think that we were heard. It doesn’t change anything if nothing has changed within our political structure within the state locally or nationally,” she said. “The main thing is the media is going to take away from the point of why people are dying. The media is going to focus on why property was damaged and I know personally that property of the state was damaged, but guess what? That’s replaceable. What’s not replaceable are the people that were killed,” Gaston said. “We are trying to yell, scream, so we had to break stuff,” she said. “But today, I didn’t want that to be the message. I didn’t want another reason for the media or the cops to incite more violence on our people. I know that happened on Saturday, but oppression has happened for 400 years every single day.” Brown said he felt the crowds were more respectful Monday and commended the leaders of the protest. “They seem to be very strong in trying to advocate for everybody to be peaceful, to obey the law and to disperse and go home,” he said. “I think the temperature, the tone, what we are seeing tonight is much different from Saturday night.” The chief said he wants to develop relationships that build trust. He said he and Mendenhall invited more than a dozen African Americans to meet with them Tuesday to discuss police policies, use of force and other topics. “I honestly believe that if we are going to make change — if we are going to change the culture, we need to start sitting down and talking face to face. It’s easy to hate from afar. You can sit at home on your couch and scream and yell and hate, but when you bring people together, all that goes away and we start seeing each other as people and we build those relationships and trust. That’s what we need right now in this country,” he said.

Recent protests against police brutality, racial discrimination and the killing of George Floyd turned violent in Salt Lake City and other cities across the nation, prompting Gov. Gary Herbert to call in the Utah National Guard. Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Mendenhall justified the weeklong curfew — which allows exceptions — by pointing to what other states have experienced amid the civil unrest following Floyd’s death in the hands of Minneapolis police. “The decision to continue a curfew here in Salt Lake City was not made lightly,” Mendenhall said in a statement. “But as we’ve seen throughout the country, the valid frustration many people feel continues to exhibit itself beyond the bounds of peaceful discourse. While Salt Lake City respects and understands the anger people legitimately feel, and welcomes the presence of peaceful protests, the safety of our city, our public safety officers, and our residents must come first.” Unfortunately, it was as curfew approached that trouble erupted Monday. Several dozen protesters who’d stayed to talk with or confront the officers and soldiers at 400 South and 300 East began arguing with each other. Some were begging protesters to leave, while a few wanted a confrontation with police. “I just came out an hour ago when I saw they were out after curfew,” said Lex Scott, the leader of Black Lives Matter, who had nothing to do with organizing Monday’s protest. She said the violence is often blamed on Black Lives Matter, and “they don’t care that we’re working peacefully for police reform, and they’re messing up our work.” Scott has been working with others to draft and pass a police reform bill. She worries that these rogue violent incidents will derail their hard-fought efforts to work with police and lawmakers to create real change in the criminal justice system. The decision to establish the new curfew was made in consultation with Gov. Gary Herbert, who issued a state of emergency Monday evening “due to civil unrest.” His order temporarily closes the state Capitol to the public through midnight Saturday evening. Official state business will continue at the Capitol, however. Throughout the curfew’s duration, Mendenhall is asking people to stay off of public streets and sidewalks and out of parks and other public spaces. She outlined exceptions for all law enforcement, fire paramedics or other medical personnel, Utah National Guard, and any other emergency response personnel authorized by Salt Lake City, as well as credentialed members of the media. The curfew also allows people traveling directly to and from work; attending religious services, obtaining food, caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling directly to and from the Salt Lake City International Airport; patronizing private businesses including but not limited to merchants and restaurants; seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or experiencing homelessness. An exception is also allowed to anyone who is given permission by city officials, according to the city’s statement.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News After much of the crowd at the Salt Lake City-County Building began disbursing just before 8 p.m., dozens headed to the Capitol where a line of Utah Highway Patrol officers were already lining the sidewalk to keep people off the grounds and away from the buildings that house state government leaders and legislators. Protesters gathered at the Utah visitors center across the street from the Capitol grounds and the street separating them from law enforcement became a protest cruise zone with numerous cars driving by with horns blaring and passengers holding up protest signs. Officers eventually began moving the group back down State Street and the final standoff of the evening took place on the 100 block of South Temple. A group there was briefly boxed in by law enforcement officers in front and behind them. After some chanting, one member of the protest group asked, through a bullhorn, if police would let them out and, after a talk with what appeared to be a supervising officer, police allowed the group to disburse just after 9:30 p.m. There were at least a handful of arrests made throughout the evening, but specific details weren’t available late Monday.

The curfew will begin each evening at 8 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. each morning, said a news release from the Mayor’s Office. During the curfew, people are asked to stay off of public streets and sidewalks and out of parks and other public spaces, with some exceptions. “The decision to continue a curfew here in Salt Lake City was not made lightly,” Mendenhall said. “But as we’ve seen throughout the country, the valid frustration many people feel continues to exhibit itself beyond the bounds of peaceful discourse. While Salt Lake City respects and understands the anger people legitimately feel, and welcomes the presence of peaceful protests, the safety of our city, our public safety officers, and our residents must come first.” SLC Police Chief Mike Brown added: “It is with a heavy heart that we enact another curfew. I hope and pray it is the last, and that we can do the hard work of building a better city together.” The mayor’s decision to establish the new curfew was arrived at in consultation with Brown and Governor Gary Herbert. “The city prides itself on protecting the right of people to peaceably assemble and protest as one of the pillars of democracy,” the news release said. “All peaceful gatherings and protests are welcomed during non-curfew hours but attendees are urged to gather in small groups and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place with the following exceptions:",0.0

Nelson, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shared a message on his social media accounts Monday, asking for peace, mutual respect and love for another. President Nelson said, “We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin. We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest.” We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. https://t.co/Jm3nDwlAmd pic.twitter.com/ub99IUvMC6 — Russell M. Nelson (@NelsonRussellM) June 1, 2020 The comments come as a Minneapolis medical examiner has classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner’s report also lists heart disease and hypertension as “other significant conditions,” along with fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. A widely seen citizen video that shows Floyd struggling with a police officer holding his knee on his neck has sparked protests worldwide. President Nelson’s statement went onto say, “Illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil.” Saturday afternoon, protesters gathered in Salt Lake City, leading to one police car being burned, one officer seriously injured, multiple counts of vandalism and 41 people arrested. The Utah National Guard was later dispatched to help law enforcement, as a weekend curfew was implemented. President Nelson concluded, “I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect, and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children.” will@cvradio.com",0.0

1622767029,2020-06-01 08:19:29,BLM Proposes Modernizing Forest Management Rules,https://etvnews.com/blm-proposes-modernizing-forest-management-rules/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blm-proposes-modernizing-forest-management-rules,en,False,,663613,ETV News,http://etv10news.com/,"First revision in 35+ years aims to increase efficiency, effectiveness of active forest management BLM News Release The Bureau of Land Management is proposing updates to antiquated regulations governing administration of timber sales and protest of forest management decisions, which haven’t been revised in more than 35 years. This proposal more effectively executes the bureau’s modern watershed and landscape-level land management planning and evaluation process, which will enable BLM to make better decisions more quickly for the benefit of taxpayers and local communities. “Over 30 years ago, the BLM proposed a protest process to ‘expedite’ timber management decisions. Unfortunately, this process has had the opposite effect,” said Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor. “This proposal seeks to ensure timely action, including for thinning activities related to fire preparedness.” “The BLM’s forest management program contributes to sustained yield of timber to support local communities, while reducing fuel loads and the potential for catastrophic wildfires that can devastate forests and surrounding communities threatening lives,” said William Perry Pendley, BLM Deputy Director for Policy and Programs. “Under the direction of President Trump’s Executive Order 13855 and Secretary Bernhardt’s Secretary’s Order 3372, the BLM is updating these rules to increase efficiency and to improve our ability to conduct active forest management on public lands.” The way BLM plans forest management projects and completes the environmental review of these projects has changed significantly since the 1980s. These proposed changes will improve the public’s ability to comment earlier in the process, when views and information have the greatest impact, rather than relying on protests after decisions have been made. Abuse of and litigation over protests has delayed the BLM’s efforts to implement active forest management with both economic and and public safety consequences. For example, the Pickett Hog timber sale in Oregon received 29 protests before auction in September 2017 – delaying the sale by more than a year. Before the BLM could complete protest reviews and responses, a wildfire destroyed a number of sale units in July 2018. Under the proposed regulations, the public comments could have been addressed before the auction was held, allowing the BLM to award the sale and the purchaser to begin thinning operations before the fire took place. When the current forest management rules were last updated in 1984, the BLM designed individual timber sales that were based on the location and extent of the forest management activity. Today, the BLM often conducts its environmental review on multiple projects in a single watershed or on a biologically-relevant scale, such as wildlife habitat for a particular species. At the same time, the BLM promotes greater collaboration and information-sharing during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, which includes multiple opportunities for public involvement at times when the views and information provided are most effective. For these reasons, the 15-day protest period, which opens after a forest management decision is issued, often occurs long after environmental review has taken place. When the protest period was first adopted, it was intended to “expedite implementation of decisions relating to timber management.” Instead, in too many cases today, individuals and organizations that are unsatisfied with the final forest management decision are using the protest process to delay implementation by filing lengthy protests with the same comments that were previously raised and addressed during the NEPA process. Responding to these protests can be costly to the public in terms of time and other resources, and in many cases offer no value to improve the agency decision or reduce appeals and litigation. It also leads to uncertainty during the auction and award of timber sales, since protest and appeal processes are not available until a decision has been issued. The proposed amendments streamline the procedures governing forest management decisions by eliminating as unnecessary the post-decision protest period and allowing a single forest management decision to cover all forest management activities covered in an environmental review document. This would help identify any issues earlier in the NEPA review process, enhancing the BLM’s ability to resolve them before advertising a timber sale or implementing other forest management activities. “Rather than streamlining the review process, as was originally envisioned, protest periods have proven to expend agency time and resources with little benefit. Focusing opportunities for public review and comment during the NEPA process, as the law’s authors intended, will enable us to make better decisions and implement them more effectively and efficiently,” Pendley said. The proposed amendments also would better use communications technology by making decisions available online, in addition to other communication platforms such as newspapers and social media. The BLM is opening a public comment period on the proposed revisions, which closes 60 days after the proposal publishes in the Federal Register. The BLM will provide additional information about when and how to comment when the proposed rule is published. For more information on the BLM’s forest management activities, visit https://www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/forests-and-woodlands Background In 2018, the BLM offered 246.2 million board feet of timber for sale, generating approximately $600 million in economic output and supporting 2,000 jobs. In addition to selling timber harvested from BLM-managed lands under the principle of sustained yield, the BLM’s forest management efforts often include fire safety and fire resilience objectives. One quarter of the 245 million acres of lands managed by the BLM are forest ecosystems, spread across 13 western states, including Alaska. Through responsible forest management, the BLM ensures the health of these forest lands as well as the availability of traditional forest products. The proposed revisions are part of a larger national wildfire reduction strategy guided by President Trump’s Executive Order 13855 – Promoting Active Management of America’s Forests, Rangelands, and Other Federal Lands to Improve Conditions and Reduce Wildfire Risk, as well as Secretary’s Order 3372 – Reducing Wildfire Risks on Department of the Interior Land through Active Management. The two orders direct Department of the Interior (DOI) to implement policies to improve forest and rangeland management practices by reducing hazardous fuel loads, mitigating fire risk and ensuring the safety and stability of local communities through active management on forests and rangelands. What They Are Saying “Anyone familiar with the Rogue Valley knows BLM public lands are important to our local economy and attract tourists from around the world. Yet, antiquated regulations and anti-forestry obstruction have made it difficult for federal land managers to complete the forest management work necessary to reduce fire risks and assure a healthy environment for residents and visitors alike,” stated Brad Hicks, CCE, President & CEO, the Chamber of Medford & Jackson County. “As a result, our Southern Oregon communities have unnecessarily endured the harmful effects of severe fire and toxic smoke in recent years. I applaud the proposed rules which will improve forest management on BLM lands, save lives as well as benefit local jobs and businesses in our community. This is quite an achievement and the effort will go a long way toward protecting our quality of life, providing relief from wildfires and smoke, and ensuring that our region remains a destination for tourism far into the future.” “The members of the American Loggers Council, spanning 34 States across the United States, fully support the proposed changes to the BLM’s forest management rules that will promote forest health, improve rural economies in forest dependent communities, and help to prevent the catastrophic wildfires that are a real threat to communities in fire prone forested areas,” stated Daniel J. Dructor, Executive Vice President, American Loggers Council. “For too long, professional, credible forest management decisions have been held up in courtrooms by serial litigants whose goals seem to be based on an emotionally charged preservationist agenda instead of forest management that is based on sound science and those forest managers that have both the background and skill set to properly manage the nation’s public forestland.” “These necessary changes will allow for more nimble management which better fit today’s forest landscape situation. The current unwieldy dinosaur regulations have created costly delays with tragic results for wildlife, watersheds, and people,” stated Idaho state Representative Judy Boyle, Chairman of the Western Legislative Forestry Task Force, and Co-Chair of the federal lands committee on federalism. “BLM’s current forest management protest process isn’t working and modernization is way overdue,” said Douglas County Commissioner and President of the Association of OC Counties Tim Freeman. “Concerns over proposed BLM projects should be identified early in the process so the BLM has an opportunity to promptly address concerns. The proposed updating of the protest process will help eliminate needless delays.” “The BLM’s administrative protest process has been abused by anti-forestry, activist groups to delay and stop needed forest management projects developed by forestry experts. More science-based management would improve the health of our overstocked federal forests, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire that threatens lives, property, and air quality, and is absolutely essential to the sustaining the long-term viability of rural communities across Oregon. Murphy Company strongly supports common sense changes to end the blatant abuse of this system to restore greater fairness and certainty for the rural communities where we operate, forestry experts and companies like ours that rely on BLM timber to continue putting Oregonians to work producing the renewable, carbon-friendly wood products we use every day,” stated John Murphy, President & CEO, Murphy Company. “We very much appreciate the Department’s work to modernize forest management rules. Years of mismanagement under antiquated practices have left millions of acres of forests across the West at risk for disease and catastrophic fire,” said Shaun Crook, 2nd Vice President, California Farm Bureau Federation. “Every day that reforms to management practices aren’t implemented represents another day of possible forest improvement lost. Our rural communities and environments depend on healthy forests, and we have to significantly increase the pace and scale of management practices so we can once again have a resilient landscape.” “Southern Oregon has been deeply impacted by catastrophic wildfire and smoke for far too long, resulting in negative health impacts, cancellations of signature cultural and sporting events, and reduced economic activity for local businesses across many sectors. The Chamber’s Natural Resource Action Team and Chamber Board of Directors has long advocated for this, so we are excited about the BLM’s proposed rule to modernize forest management decisions. This will help increase the pace and scale of thinning and other activities on local BLM lands, which is essential to protecting our communities, supporting our economy and reducing the risks of fire and smoke in the future,” said Sue Kupillas, Chair, Natural Resources Action Team, the Chamber of Medford & Jackson County. “It is not only a good time to be looking at changing the protest mechanism within forest management regulations,” said Eric Carleson, Executive Director, Associated California Loggers. “It is an urgently needed change. These provisions, and others, have not been changed in 35+ years, and over the decades, the nature of forest management has changed against a background of enhanced environmental review on the one hand, and the impact of massive wildfires in the West on the other. The ‘protest’ mechanism was intended to streamline management planning and decision-making; it has devolved down to a mechanism that slows down projects which are urgently needed for fuels reduction and forest health, without a commensurate improvement in the review process.” “These updates improve the opportunity of timely implementation of management plans. Federal land managers have a wide diversity of resource experts designing and implementing management activity. The unnecessary delaying of needed action is a serious problem for resource managers. If the medical community was subject to justifying their every action, most patients would die before they reached the operating table. The forests are Interior’s patient, and the experts are in emergency mode. These updates will help them get the job done more expeditiously,” stated Bill Mulligan, Idaho Forester, Trinity Consulting. “Extremists have hijacked the protest process in order to destroy jobs, drain forest revenues and jeopardize the safety of our mountain communities. Today’s action increases transparency by posting protest decisions online as well as in newspapers and on social media. Modernizing this broken system after nearly four decades is badly needed and will provide significant benefits for public safety, the economy and the environment. I thank Secretary Bernhardt, Deputy Secretary MacGregor and BLM Acting Director Pendley for this leadership,” said U.S. Congressman Tom McClintock (CA-04).",0.0

In all, Utah has administered 205,855 total tests. Additionally, it is estimated that 5,813 Utahns have recovered from COVID-19. Thank you and your families again for doing your part to slow the spread of COVID-19. Unemployment Unemployment insurance claims dropped 13% from the previous week to 5,455 claims. While it is a 13% decrease from the previous week, it is still a 382% increase from the average weekly claims seen in 2019. More than $26.4 million has been paid in state benefits while more than $48.8 million has been paid in federal dollars from the CARES Act $600 weekly stimulus. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) claims had an additional 2,278 individuals filed and more than $8.1 million paid in federal dollars last week for PUA benefits. More than 9,700 individuals ended their unemployment claim last week. This is a positive indicator that people are beginning to return to work. High Risk Individuals 70% of those who have passed away from COVID-19 were 65+ years old. 90% of those who have passed away were 65+ years old and had an underlying medical condition. Please help us protect our high-risk population and take the necessary precautions if you fall within this category. High-risk individuals include anyone over the age of 65, people who live in a nursing home or long-term facility, people with chronic lung disease or moderate-to-severe asthma, people with severe heart conditions, and people who are immunocompromised, obese or have other underlying health conditions. It is essential that high risk individuals continue to follow the guidelines issued by the Department of Health. Utah Leads Together 3.0 The economic focus in the Utah Leads Together 3.0 plan is the state’s next step in continuing the growth of our strong and diverse economy that makes Utah a national leader. As we each continue to do our part, we will get through this together. The Utah Leads Together 3.0 plan can be viewed here. Appropriations Subcommittees Last week, Appropriations Subcommittees met to discuss potential budget cuts. Legislators will reduce the budget by up to $1 billion to make up for economic losses due to COVID-19. These are not easy decisions, but cuts must be made somewhere. Committees discussed potential 2%, 5% and 10% cuts to each budget. Brief summaries of the appropriations subcommittees are provided below. For more details, please visit le.utah.gov. Social Services The Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee met on Tuesday and Friday last week to discuss budget cuts at the 2%, 5% and 10% levels primarily affecting the Department of Health, the Department of Workforce Services and the Department of Human Services. The committee made several amendments to the proposed list before sending recommendations to the Executive Appropriations Committee. Business, Economic Development and Labor On Wednesday, the Business, Economic Development, and Labor Appropriations Subcommittee met and approved recommended cuts at the 2%, 5%, and 10% level for the following entities: Labor Commission, Dept. of Insurance, Tax Commission, Dept. of Commerce, GOED, DABC and the Dept. of Heritage and Arts. These cuts will be forwarded on to the Executive Appropriations Committee for their consideration. The committee also voted unanimously to communicate to EAC that despite their recommended cuts to DABC, it be held as harmless as possible, given that it is a revenue-generating entity for the state. Public Education On Wednesday, the Public Education Appropriations Subcommittee met and approved recommended cuts at the 2% level. They began providing recommendations at the 5% level, but ran out of time. They will meet again Monday, June 1. Legislative Fiscal Analysts (LFA), Utah State Board of Education (USBE) and Utah School Boards Association (USBA) all made their own list of proposed cuts. The majority of the suggestions that passed committee were those that LFA and USBE were in agreement on with USBA providing support for many of the recommendations. Public education will likely see fewer cuts than other parts of the budget. Retirement and Independent Entities On Wednesday, the Retirement and Independent Entities Appropriations Subcommittee met and approved recommended cuts at the 2%, 5% and 10% level for the Executive Appropriations Committee to consider. There were minimal changes from the agency suggestions on both the one-time and ongoing cuts. Executive Offices and Criminal Justice After considering proposed cuts at the 2%, 5% and 10% level, the Executive Offices and Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee will reconvene on Monday, June 1, to vote on the items considered in the meeting held Wednesday, May 27. Higher Education Many have asked if the Legislature can just use the rainy day fund to supplement the economic losses in public and higher education. Utah has two rainy day accounts: the education and general rainy day funds. Both sources are for one-time funding and are generally used to backfill deficits. Historically, the Legislature has tried to reduce spending prior to using these funds. On Wednesday, the Higher Education Appropriations Subcommittee recommended to allow each institution to determine where to make cuts in their individual budgets once new revenue estimates have been released and the Legislature determines if a 2%, 5% or 10% cut is needed. For a list of proposed cuts in higher education, please click here. Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environmental Quality The Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environmental Quality Appropriations Subcommittee met on Wednesday and approved the recommended cuts at 2%, 5% and 10% from the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Agriculture and Food, Department of Environment Quality, Office of Energy Development, and Public Lands Policy Coordination Office. Rioting on Saturday I was very saddened to see the rioting in Salt Lake City and throughout the country. Our Constitution allows people to peacefully gather and protest, but this was outright thievery and personal and public property damage. Violence detracts from the message the protest was hoping to emphasize. Those responsible should be held accountable. There is plenty of video to determine those perpetrators. I want to thank all of the law enforcement agencies that responded in a professional manner to a challenging situation without anyone being seriously injured. I was also pleased that on Sunday, volunteers helped clean up the Capitol building and other areas that were defaced. We will get through this as well, but people need to start standing up for the Rule of Law, upon which our country firmly stands. Thanks again for the opportunity to update you and for the privilege of representing you. I will always stand tall for our rural values!",0.0

Nelson — are speaking out about racism in sermons, speeches and social media statements. “We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life,” the 95-year-old leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wrote Monday on Facebook. “We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin.” The Almighty “calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children,” he added. “Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent.” At the same time, Nelson said, church officials “are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest.” Nelson, who met in 2018 with top NAACP officers and spoke last year at the civil rights group’s national convention, decried looting, defacing and destroying property. “Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong,” he said. “Evil has never been resolved by more evil."" (Francisco Kjolseth | Tribune file photo) Calvary Baptist Church Pastor Oscar T. Moses poses for a photograph with Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City.  Recent episodes “of barefaced racism…[have] lit an intense flame across the country,” the Rev. Oscar T. Moses, new pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Salt Lake City wrote on the church’s website. “ … While it is within our responsibility as Christians to respond to injustice everywhere, the manner in which we respond is crucial.” Moses, a police-officer-turned-pastor who is in the process of moving to the Beehive State from Chicago, urged his mostly black congregants “to measure our concentrated response to these tragic events peacefully.” Saturday’s protest in downtown Salt Lake City took place two blocks from First United Methodist Church. “I am grateful that the church building was unharmed and that there was no loss of life during these events,” the Rev. Elizabeth McVicker wrote in an email. “While I do not condone the destruction of property and attacks on police officers, the recurrent problem of racism against minorities, particularly African Americans, within the American justice system must be addressed. We as a society must deeply examine and remove the long-standing biases which have led to the trajectory of prejudice, mistreatment and lack of educational and economic opportunity for people of color.” (Photo courtesy of the Rev. Elizabeth McVicker) The Rev. Elizabeth McVicker, pastor of Salt Lake City's First United Methodist Church, is shown preaching. Article continues below Bishop Scott Hayashi of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah added his voice to the chorus of those denouncing racism. The brutal killing of George Floyd “was not an isolated incident,” Hayashi said. “In February, Ahmaud Arbery was killed in Georgia. In March, Breonna Taylor was killed in Kentucky. During the last three years, racism has become more pronounced and utilized as a tool for political gain.” The Salt Lake City demonstrations, like others around the nation, were “an expression of people who had reached the boiling point with the state of our nation.” The bishop does not condone violence, he said, but he believes “protest is important when time and time again all that is offered for these incidents are thoughts and prayers.” (Francisco Kjolseth | Tribune file photo) Imam Shuaib Din tours the site of the new mosque going up in West Jordan in October 2019.  Recent police actions undermine the argument that racist responses are rare, taken by “a few bad apples,” says Imam Shuaib Din of Utah Islamic Center in Sandy. “Systemic bigotry and racism exist across the country. We need full-scale reform of our law enforcement agencies, so we don’t ever have something like this happen again. Standing Together, an alliance of nearly 100 evangelical congregations and ministries across the Wasatch Front, condemned — “in the strongest terms possible” — Floyd’s death. “As a nation, we must enter into an empathetic and deeply honest, convicted and civil conversation on racism in America with the intensity to eradicate to the greatest degree possible the evidence and actions of racist behaviors against any and all minority communities,” said the Rev. Greg Johnson, president of the coalition. “In concert with my personal friend and dear ministry partner, Pastor Corey J. Hodges of The Point Church in Kearns, I am calling for the people of Utah to … live [their] lives in such a way that what we say we condemn in private conversations is lived out in our public actions. … Continued violence and outward destruction of community property must cease, but the voices of those who hurt and suffer because of the evil of racism must not be quieted or disregarded.” Friday was the day Jews celebrated receiving the Ten Commandments. “In the Torah, it teaches that everyone was created in the image and likeness of God,” said Rabbi Samuel Spector of Salt Lake City’s Congregation Kol Ami. “What we learn is that the fulfillment of one commandment leads to the fulfillment of another.

Nelson — are speaking out about racism in sermons, speeches and social media statements. “We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life,” the 95-year-old leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wrote Monday on Facebook. “We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin.” The Almighty “calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children,” he added. “Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent.” At the same time, Nelson said, church officials “are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest.” Nelson, who met in 2018 with top NAACP officers and spoke last year at the civil rights group’s national convention, decried looting, defacing and destroying property. “Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong,” he said. “Evil has never been resolved by more evil.""

Recent episodes “of barefaced racism…[have] lit an intense flame across the country,” the Rev. Oscar T. Moses, new pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Salt Lake City wrote on the church’s website. “ … While it is within our responsibility as Christians to respond to injustice everywhere, the manner in which we respond is crucial.” Moses, a police-officer-turned-pastor who is in the process of moving to the Beehive State from Chicago, urged his mostly black congregants “to measure our concentrated response to these tragic events peacefully.” Saturday’s protest in downtown Salt Lake City took place two blocks from First United Methodist Church. “I am grateful that the church building was unharmed and that there was no loss of life during these events,” the Rev. Elizabeth McVicker wrote in an email. “While I do not condone the destruction of property and attacks on police officers, the recurrent problem of racism against minorities, particularly African Americans, within the American justice system must be addressed. We as a society must deeply examine and remove the long-standing biases which have led to the trajectory of prejudice, mistreatment and lack of educational and economic opportunity for people of color.” (Photo courtesy of the Rev.

The brutal killing of George Floyd “was not an isolated incident,” Hayashi said. “In February, Ahmaud Arbery was killed in Georgia. In March, Breonna Taylor was killed in Kentucky. During the last three years, racism has become more pronounced and utilized as a tool for political gain.” The Salt Lake City demonstrations, like others around the nation, were “an expression of people who had reached the boiling point with the state of our nation.” The bishop does not condone violence, he said, but he believes “protest is important when time and time again all that is offered for these incidents are thoughts and prayers.” (Francisco Kjolseth | Tribune file photo) Imam Shuaib Din tours the site of the new mosque going up in West Jordan in October 2019.  Recent police actions undermine the argument that racist responses are rare, taken by “a few bad apples,” says Imam Shuaib Din of Utah Islamic Center in Sandy. “Systemic bigotry and racism exist across the country. We need full-scale reform of our law enforcement agencies, so we don’t ever have something like this happen again. Standing Together, an alliance of nearly 100 evangelical congregations and ministries across the Wasatch Front, condemned — “in the strongest terms possible” — Floyd’s death. “As a nation, we must enter into an empathetic and deeply honest, convicted and civil conversation on racism in America with the intensity to eradicate to the greatest degree possible the evidence and actions of racist behaviors against any and all minority communities,” said the Rev. Greg Johnson, president of the coalition. “In concert with my personal friend and dear ministry partner, Pastor Corey J. Hodges of The Point Church in Kearns, I am calling for the people of Utah to … live [their] lives in such a way that what we say we condemn in private conversations is lived out in our public actions. … Continued violence and outward destruction of community property must cease, but the voices of those who hurt and suffer because of the evil of racism must not be quieted or disregarded.” Friday was the day Jews celebrated receiving the Ten Commandments. “In the Torah, it teaches that everyone was created in the image and likeness of God,” said Rabbi Samuel Spector of Salt Lake City’s Congregation Kol Ami. “What we learn is that the fulfillment of one commandment leads to the fulfillment of another.

Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

One of them was Shea Freedom, a musician and activist based in Salt Lake City. KUER’s Caroline Ballard caught up with him on Sunday to hear about his experience. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Caroline Ballard: How has your experience influenced how you think about the unique intersection of civil rights & LGBTQ rights? Shea Freedom: I lived most my life as a black woman, enduring and surviving in America. The endurance of the black female spirit is astonishing, because you know what it's like to walk through the world concerned for safety. Having the understanding of what it is to be a black woman in America and then stepping into my manhood has really opened up my eyes to the risks and see social subtleties — the tightenings of hands around children, the intentionally looking you in the eye and crossing the street. There's a certain fear. CB:You were at the demonstrations this weekend and you were on the side of the protesters, but from what I understand, were also arguing somewhat with their methods. SF: Absolutely. The protests that I had signed up for was never even supposed to involve foot traffic in respect of COVID-19. I was on the side of the protesters and the demonstrators when we were conducting the car rally. When I got back with my friends after doing that, I sat and watched the news a bit and I saw things escalating. I could see agitators. I could see young people wanting to be a part of something bigger than themselves, but with a misunderstanding of how to do that. I went back the second time around and I walked the line a lot, and I kept mostly my left shoulder to the officer, my right shoulder to the crowd. Every time I'd walk by an officer and a protester, I looked to my left. I go, ""You guys get home safe, all right?"" I looked to my right. ""You guys get home safe. All right?"" And I walked the line back and forth, back and forth all night, asking people to respect the space and telling them, ""your anger is valid and you have a right to it. Let's maintain a peaceful protest, because these officers right now, they're like a fire. If we stick our hand in their space, we're going to get burned."" But I had at the end of the night met four people who were arrested. I was a couple paces ahead and they were flanked. And at that point, since I was two paces ahead, I had booked it. I had made it to a place that provided cover and shadow. There was nothing I could do except for watch and figure out how to get out of the area I was in and found an officer who had recognized me from one of the lines earlier. And I asked if he could provide me an escort back to my vehicle. And Mike, if you're listening to this, thank you very much. CB: We've heard a lot about tension and destruction. But was there a moment that you found especially moving or beautiful? SF: Yeah. Being a part of the original car caravan, every time we rolled by, we had seen these people called Proud Boys. What I had gathered from people around me and things I had heard was they were Trump supporters. A few of them had open weapons on their hips, and they were all dressed in a sort of uniform. And so, I watched them every time we circled around that part of the block. Our last circle, I had jumped off the vehicle and went over there to thank them. My friends were a little concerned. I'm a black trans man and these are some Proud Boys. I can't speak to their values, but I can speak to the way they conducted themselves. And from what I saw, that was decency and dignity and peacefulness. And that's the world I'd like to see no matter our agreements and disagreements. At one point I had talked to a fellow they called Chief. He told me he was head of an organization that was Latinos for Trump. I kind of laughed and said to him, ""what a complexity that must be."" And then I admitted to him something vulnerable. I said to him, ""On Trump's Inauguration Day, I had tried to take my own life."" Proud to say that is no longer my point of sanity or existence. But before I could say anything, he grabbed me and gave me a hug. It wasn't an arm in between bros hug. It was a real human-to-human hug. And after he looked at me and he grabbed me by my shoulders and he said, ""Your life is more important than that."" I don't know what his position is on trans lives, but after that I felt compelled to give him my contact information. He later asked me unexpectedly if I had gotten home safe. That was another beautiful experience with someone of different values, views. He also informed me that his automobile was severely vandalized and without pause my reaction was, ""How can I help?""

During their speeches, those who identified as white allies formed a protective barrier around speakers and protesters. “As a mother and grandmother of brilliant black sons and grandsons, I am suffocated by the burden of the responsibility that I have to render that talk of the unwritten rules of how to make it home alive,” Monique Reed said, reading a poem she wrote. “I can’t breathe. I am angry.” When Reed began to cry, four women standing around her extended their arms to give her support. Reed cried silently, as did many of the speakers and members of the crowd. “I can’t breathe. I am paralyzed with disappointment at the death of my sons,” she said, concluding her poem. Men, women and children wore shirts with the insignia “Black Lives Matter” and held signs showing support during the protest and during the addresses. Those gathered for the protest chanted “I can’t breathe” throughout the day. Protesters also held a moment of silence for George Floyd’s wife. During these moments, the protest became tearful and emotional for many of the members. Malik Dayo, the event organizer, asked the multitude to sing, “I can hear my brothers crying. I can’t breathe. Now I am in the struggle, and I can lead calling on the violence of the racist police. We ain’t gonna stop ’til people are free.” Support and pride were abundant in the crowd as the chants and protest began to disperse. “It was a powerful protest, and I am proud to be from Ogden,” attendee Allison James said. This protest was Ogden’s largest Black Lives Matter protest, according to speakers at the event. Even with the many police cars and officers in the streets, the protest ended with all walking away peacefully.",0.0

Some city leaders now worry such gatherings could lead to new outbreaks of COVID-19.  Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced Sunday that the city will be offering free tests to demonstrators.  ""We did see and have witnessed people demonstrating in our community – peacefully, as well as after hours when it's not so peaceful – without face coverings, and so we want to remind everyone and invite you that next weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, go down to the Pepsi Center and get tested for COVID-19 for free,"" said Hancock. ""It's free, it is quick, it is painless and at least we can use that opportunity to make sure that we continue to blunt the spread of the coronavirus.""  A spokesperson with the city says people would not need to declare – or prove – they'd been at a protest in order to qualify for testing, but that they would need to register online and provide a name and address.  As Dr. Emily Landon, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, told NPR, it takes at least three to five days after exposure before a nasal swab test will be able to pick up on an infection. Denver's testing event fits with that window, as it begins five days after Sunday's demonstration. Protests are expected to continue this week. City officials in other places, like Atlanta and New York, are also encouraging protesters to get tested for COVID-19. New York City's health department offered tips for protesters on how to avoid spreading COVID-19:  Plan to protest? Here are tips to reduce the risk of spreading #COVID19: ✔️Wear a face covering ✔️Wear eye protection to prevent injury ✔️Stay hydrated ✔️Use hand sanitizer ✔️Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead ✔️Stick to a small group ✔️Keep 6 feet from other groups— nychealthy (@nycHealthy) May 30, 2020 As The Verge pointed out, law enforcement's handling of the events could make the complicated task of contact tracing even more difficult than usual: ""People who test positive for the coronavirus may be reluctant to tell health officials if they were at protests because they may worry about retaliation. They might not want to identify people they interacted with at the protests for the same reasons. That's just one way mistrust makes it difficult for public health officials to track down clusters of COVID-19.""  According to Dr. Jonathan Samet, dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, there's roughly a 13-day lag between when someone gets infected with COVID-19 and when they may need to be hospitalized for it. Dean is an epidemiologist who has been working with the state's health department to model its COVID-19 outbreak.  Like police brutality, the virus has disproportionately affected people of color.

As protests continued to erupt across the country, Reuters reported Monday that the Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled Floyd’s death a homicide. The black man was allegedly murdered by Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, who is white. A viral cellphone video shows Floyd lying face down on the pavement in handcuffs with Chauvin kneeling on his neck. Floyd says that he can’t breathe. Chauvin keeps his knee on the man’s neck for almost nine minutes, even after his body goes limp. A Minneapolis Fire Department ambulance report says Floyd was pulseless when he was placed on a stretcher. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, The Associated Press reported. Chauvin has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota’s Star Tribune called it an “unusually swift move” by the prosecutor’s office and the first time a white Minnesota police officer has been charged in the death of black citizen. The cellphone footage sparked massive outrage in Minneapolis and across the country, unleashing days of unrest, police in riot gear, National Guard units on American streets, and hard questions — including how presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Republican President Donald Trump will respond to a moment of national reckoning. Until Monday evening, Trump’s response has mostly been to Tweet and encourage governors to use military force. In a conference call, he urged governors to “dominate” the protests, “or you’ll look like a bunch of jerks,” CNN reported. Some presidential allies — like campaign donors and congressional Republicans, including several leading senators — privately and publicly lobbied Trump to appeal for national unity and adopt a tone of “healing and calm,” according to CNN. Instead, when Trump addressed reporters in the Rose Garden on Monday evening, he blamed local leaders for the growing protests, threatened to send active-duty military units to states where governors do not deploy the National Guard in “overwhelming” numbers, and called himself “your president of law and order.” “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers,” to Washington, he said, citing unruly protests that had reportedly caused the president to take refuge in the White House bunker. Defense department officials told CNN a military police battalion of 200 to 250 active-duty personnel was being deployed to the capitol. Helicopters and detonations could be heard in the background as cameras awaited the president and again as he returned to the White House. CNN reported that “peaceful protesters” near the grounds were “dispersed with tear gas and flash bangs.” In the Washington Post on Monday, “The Plum Line” columnist Greg Sargent argued that Trump’s response to the protests has left a national leadership vacuum, an opportunity for Biden to gain ground — or lose it. The presumptive nominee has been stuck inside during safe-at-home coronavirus directives, reaching supporters only through social media or literal home videos. On Monday, Biden ventured out to Wilmington, in his home state of Delaware, to meet with community leaders at a black church. One way to rally support would be to select a running mate who could sway voters on the fence about supporting another 70-something-year-old white male nominee. Biden announced in March his intent to chose a female running mate if he is nominated, but his short list might have grown a little shorter this past week. Questions arose Friday about the viability of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a vice-presidential candidate on Friday amid reports that the former prosecutor chose not to present charges in multiple officer-involved shootings during her tenure, instead ceding the cases to a grand jury — a practice some experts said could favor the officers, The New York Times reported. “I think that was wrong, now,” Klobuchar told MSNBC on Friday. She was a prosecutor in Hennepin County for seven years, ending in 2006. “I think it would have been much better had I took the responsibility, and looked at the cases and made the decision myself.” Chauvin reportedly received similar treatment in a shooting involving several other officers in 2006 that was adjudicated after Klobuchar left for the Senate. When asked if her record disqualified her to be on the Democratic ticket, Klobuchar told MSNBC’S Andrew Mitchell that was Biden’s decision to make. Trump’s rhetoric about the protests may have offered Biden a way out of that tight spot on Friday, when Biden said he was “furious” with Trump’s call for “violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many.” But Biden is not alone. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference Thursday that days of protests were the result of “anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years.” “If you’re feeling that sadness, and that anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right. It’s a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived,” the mayor continued. And on Monday, Houston police chief Art Acevedo scolded the president, via CNN. “Please,” he told Trump, looking at the camera, “if you don’t have something constructive to say, keep your mouth shut, because you’re putting men and women in their early twenties at risk. It’s not about dominating. It’s about winning hearts and minds.” Further, Acevedo encouraged protestors to redirect their ire. “Let’s shift this where it needs to be: To the voting booth.”",0.0

1622833230,2020-06-01 23:38:07,Sarah Jane Weaver: The surprising lesson I learned about race from an unexpected friend,https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2020-05-31/sarah-jane-weaver-naacp-race-conversations-185586,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"In the midst of riots and unrest across the United States yesterday, I read an article about race relations by an African American woman I admire very much. It made me uncomfortable. I needed to know why. I met Reverend Theresa Dear almost a year ago in July at a convention for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. We listened together as a former student of Martin Luther King Jr. spoke about the NAACP and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “We have more in common than that which may superficially divide us,” Reverend Amos C. Brown, pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, had said. Moments later he quoted the words of the NAACP national hymn “Lift Every Voice and Sing” — an anthem that for 100 years had voiced a cry of affirmation for African Americans — and “Come, Come, Ye Saints” — the anthem for persecuted 19th century pioneers in the Church of Jesus Christ. “It can be well in this nation when we lock arms,” he said. “Not as black and white. Not as Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Baptist. But as children of God who are about loving everybody and bringing hope, happiness and health to all of God’s children.” As Reverend Brown spoke, I remember looking at Reverend Dear. We both knew we were participating in something remarkable. Since then, we have shared meals and conversations. She called and prayed with me after my father died. I want to travel to Chicago to hear her preach. We are friends. Still her column published in the Deseret News, titled “Black America can’t Breathe” and detailing the death of a black person at the hands of white police officer, made me uncomfortable. She even acknowledged the imagery of such events sear “psychological trauma” into our nation’s consciousness. “A lot of people don’t want to talk about racism in these stark terms,” she wrote. “Is it painful for black and white people to talk about this issue? Of course it is. However, if we don’t talk about it, we become passive participants in an unrighteous, immoral culture.” With her, I condemn hatred, bigotry and violence. I agreed with everything she wrote. Yet I was uncomfortable. People protest police brutality at the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City on, Saturday, May 30, 2020.

Video showed an officer kneeling on his neck while he implored, “I can’t breathe.” Credit: Ivy Ceballo, Deseret News Maybe this was not because a conversation about race would be painful, but because I simply don’t know what one would look like. Or what I would say. Or if my belief that major race relations were a larger issue for my parents than they are for me somehow makes me part of the problem. I turned on the television — watched rioters in downtown Salt Lake City overturn and burn cars — and realized that it does. I am part of the problem. I have traveled the globe for my work and never had a bad experience related to race. In fact, most of my career has been spent covering Latter-day Saints of many nationalities and races united by their belief in Jesus Christ and in His Church. So as I watched riots on the streets near Church headquarters and Temple Square, I searched for meaning in Reverend Dear’s words. My desire, as I watched those who incite violence, was for true insight. I started to think about what Reverend Dear meant by “conversation.” I have family and dear friends who could teach me something about race, but I have never asked them how their race has defined their identity and their experiences. In all the interviews I have done for the Church News, I have only asked about race two times — both when interviewing newly sustained African American leaders. I wonder now if my tone accompanying those questions was apologetic. Even during meaningful conversations with Reverend Dear, I don’t recall ever asking about her own experiences as an African American woman. And we met at a NAACP event. I wish I knew why. Maybe it is because in all my efforts to show my children — and myself — that I am tolerant, I have refused to acknowledge race at all. I have been so fearful that I would cause hurt or pain — or that I may make myself or another uncomfortable — that I missed the insight that could have blessed my life and others by deepening my understanding of a very real part of the human experience. In a recent interview, President Russell M. Nelson spoke of the responsibility parents have to help their children. Strong families, he said, will be reflected in strong communities and strong nations. President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and his wife Sister Wendy Nelson share a laugh with Reverend Theresa Dear and Dr. Amos Brown at the 110th annual national convention for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Detroit on Sunday, July 21, 2019. Credit: Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Conversations about race need to start in our homes. From there they will flow into our communities and elevate our nations. “Ultimately, we realize that only the comprehension of the true Fatherhood of God can bring full appreciation of the true brotherhood of men and the true sisterhood of women,” said President Nelson at the Church’s 2018 “Be One” event. “That understanding inspires us with passionate desire to build bridges of cooperation instead of walls of segregation.” Today I returned to an interview I conducted with Reverend Dear on the first day we met last July. Just as when I read her article yesterday — her words again blessed my life with insight and understanding. Her words dispelled my discomfort, replacing it with a desire to know more and do better. They echo President Nelson’s words and give all of us a sure place to start this conversation about the brotherhood and sisterhood of the human family. “When you come together in the name of Jesus Christ,” she said, “that in and of itself is liberating.”",0.0

Biden made the announcement to political, religious and education leaders gathered at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Del., to address ongoing protests nationwide. The protests follow George Floyd’s death last week. They were sparked by video showing police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck nearly nine minutes as Floyd was handcuffed, lying down. Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck while he was pleading, “I can’t breathe,” and repeatedly said, “mama,” and “please,” according to the criminal complaint. It also included nearly three minutes when Floyd was non-responsive. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter Friday. Three other officers by his side during the incident haven’t been charged. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee listened and took notes before standing to address the crowd. He said, if elected president, he would take action to address “institutional racism” within the first 100 days. “We’re going to make sure that the economic recovery deals with … institutional racism but also economic structures that need to be fixed,” Biden said. Biden also said he would put the oversight panel established during the Obama administration to investigate police practices back in place. The nation needs to “change the way police are trained,” he said. Biden added that changing the Senate makeup is also key to addressing racism through policy. “It’s not enough to win the presidency,” Biden said. “We have to win back the Senate. We have to change the leadership in the Senate. Mitch McConnell cannot remain the majority leader in the Senate.” Though the group was full of support for Biden, there was also critical feedback, including some saying that under the Obama administration, there was not enough of an economic boost for the community. One participant also raised concern about his involvement in the 1994 crime bill, which has been criticized for its mandatory minimum sentencing provision. Biden was also pressed on selecting a black woman as his running mate. “I promise you there are multiple African American candidates being considered,” Biden said. Prior to Monday’s meeting, Biden spoke with protesters in Wilmington on an unannounced trip unaccompanied by press, but his campaign later posted a photo of him at the protest site.",0.0

Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., former Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes and former Utah GOP Chairman Thomas Wright were all critical of fellow candidate Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox for heading up the state task force on the deadly virus while running for office and for how some $100 million was spent on testing and other contracts. But Cox shot back, “What has been said is absolutely right in one sense and that is that the politicization of this disease is awful and the only people playing politics with this disease are the people on this stage.” Utah, he said, is “better off than any other state in the country and the people of Utah know that.” Huntsman said not only has there “been absolutely no accountability” for the expenditures, “the only people able to campaign and politicize have been those in the governor’s office, using the platform, using it as a bully pulpit. This is absolutely absurd, while we sit under house arrest and try to do our best to run a campaign.” Wright said Cox’s statement was not fair, coming from a candidate in the race for almost two years as a sitting elected official. “This is why we see this unrest,” Wright said, referring to the protests over the death of a black man in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck. “People are frustrated with their government and they don’t trust their elected officials.” Hughes took issue with a short-lived attempt by the state to track people coming into Utah through an alert on their phones, “communist-style snitch hotlines” in some places, and the closure of churches as well as “single-source, no-bid contracts” given out despite some companies being willing to provide services at no costs. However, Hughes disagreed with Huntsman’s contention that the way to avoid politicizing the pandemic was to have put a public health official in charge of the state task force. “The buck stops with our public servants,” the former speaker said, noting generals don’t make the final decision to go to war. Cox suggested the other candidates “get their facts straight,” pointing out that responding was voluntary to the phone alert while crossing state lines. He said that “certainly in hindsight, there are some things that we could have done differently. But by and large, we have had a tremendous response to the coronavirus crisis.” Grid View Former Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, left, bumps elbows with former Gov.

Ivy Ceballo, Deseret News Afterwards, the lieutenant governor told reporters he had no regrets about his role as head of the task force and said Gov. Gary Herbert, who is not seeking reelection after more than a decade in office, “has been in charge of this response from the very beginning, no question about that,” and that his role was organizational. Cox said he would “not hesitate” to appoint his running mate, state Sen. Deidre Henderson, R-Spanish Fork, in a similar role and compared his appointment by Herbert to Vice President Mike Pence being named the head of President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 response effort. The candidates also addressed the response to the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, including a protest in Salt Lake City that turned violent. Shortly before the 6 p.m. debate in the PBS Utah studios at the University of Utah, Trump said he would deploy U.S, troops to states that don’t fully utilize their National Guard units. Huntsman, who served as Trump’s U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he would want to talk to the president about whether law enforcement has been given enough appreciation for “restraint that was shown in the face of anarchy” and then bring up seeing military vehicles deployed and curfews imposed. “I would say, ‘Mr. President, I am concerned about civil liberties. This is not what we see in the state of Utah. Maybe others, but not here. This is what you see in other countries. We have the ability to manage our own situation, thank you very much,’” Huntsman said. Herbert activated the Utah National Guard on Saturday and Cox said the destructive behavior seen in Salt Lake City, that included burning two vehicles and defacing public and private property, was rightly met by strength because “we must have law and order.” “Let’s be very clear. The death of George Floyd was a murder and there is no place for police brutality in America. We know that and we have to stand up strong,” Cox said. “At the same time, these lawful protests that are taking place have been hijacked by agents of chaos, by people who don’t care about the movement at all.” Hughes said there’s a big difference between a protest and a riot. While he said he counts himself among those protesting “the outrage, the murder that we did truly see before our eyes,” rioters striving to create civil unrest have to be dealt with “head-on.” The former speaker said he agrees with Trump that states have to be tough, citing enforcement of efforts to stop the virus spread. “If you’re going to go and go find quarantine issues to bring down the law but you’re not going to let these issues be handled and you’re going to let these rioters go, that’s a deal-killer.” Wright said he is “very uncomfortable” with what happened to Floyd and said as governor, he’d institute additional training for both new and current law enforcement officers in the state to ensure “they are listening and learning and we’re being compassionate with each other and we can take action on racial inequality.” Also during the debate, Hughes raised the issue of Democratic voters, including former Utah Democratic Party Chairman Jim Dabakis, registering as Republicans to vote in the party’s closed primary, calling it “brazen behavior” intended to stop him from winning as the most conservative candidate. Huntsman, who stepped down shortly after being elected to a second term to serve as President Barack Obama’s U.S. ambassador to China, touted his experience and leadership, while Wright spoke of being an outsider who continues to run a real estate business as a candidate. Cox said he’s running because he loves the state and believes better times are ahead. He promised to “get my hands dirty” working side-by-side with Utahns. “Politics in this country is broken,” the lieutenant governor said, “but it’s not broken in Utah.”",0.0

Attendees gathered to protest police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Tanzi Propst/Park Record More photos from the demonstration are available here. A Park City crowd gathered on the sun-soaked turf of Dozier Field midday on Monday in tribute to George Floyd, the black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered widespread protests in the U.S., showing solidarity with those who are outraged during a peaceful demonstration that urged the crowd to speak out against racism, highlighted the civil rights movement and spoke of America as one nation. The majority of the people at the gathering were white. There was a mix of ages that ranged from teens to senior citizens. Elected officials like Mayor Andy Beerman joined the demonstration, but it appeared that the crowd was made up mostly of everyday Parkites. The crowd spread out across a portion of the football field in what was the first major demonstration in Park City since social distancing guidelines were implemented in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Park City High School students organized the event and were some of the featured speakers. The crowd early on kneeled on the football field for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, marking the time a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck. It was an especially poignant moment during the demonstration as the people silently kept their knee on the turf. Some gripped signs with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breathe.” Support Local Journalism Donate  As part of the rally, demonstrators knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held his knee against Floyd’s throat. Sandra Hollins, a black state legislator from Salt Lake City, delivered some of the most notable comments of the event, speaking to the crowd about civil rights-era figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. She described the situation in the nation as “pent-up pain unleashed.” “Do not fight hate with hate,” she said. Hollins said much progress has been made since segregation but more work is needed. She spoke about the importance of voting and said voting laws unfairly target black people and others. Hollins said communities of color experience pain daily and said there is outrage with another black man killed by the police. “They fear the power of your vote,” she said. Hollins also urged young people to become involved rather than limiting their participation to using social media and said young people were on the front lines of the civil rights era. “Use your privilege to disrupt the system,” Hollins said. The event on Monday was initially planned as a march on Main Street to City Park followed by a rally. The venue was changed to Dozier Field on the grounds of Park City High School shortly after the announcement that an event would be held. There were fewer logistical challenges at Dozier Field than there would have been on Main Street and on the route to City Park for an event that was planned over the course of just several days. The organizers sought a peaceful protest and, before it was shifted to Dozier Field, urged people not to loot, riot, paint graffiti or engage in violent acts. The Park City Police Department observed the demonstration. No incidents were reported. The organizers said upward of 300 people attended. Lance Rothchild, a junior at the high school and one of the organizers, said in an interview afterward the event was successful in raising awareness and inspiring people to act. “The ultimate goal is to completely get rid of systemic racism and police brutality,” he said, adding, “We did what we could to help.”",0.0

As Druce recounts this situation with ABC4 News Monday, he said the man’s actions appeared to be malicious. “I’m definitely convinced that he was there to cause harm and I hope that he gets prosecuted accordingly,” Druce said. And he said he hopes these kinds of situations stop. “I hate seeing this stuff,” Druce said. “It really sickens me. I know that one day we can see a world where racism and police brutality isn’t a thing that pops up on my every time I go to check Instagram.” While no charges have been filed at this time, Wilking said his department is screening video footage and taking witness statements. “We would encourage anybody that has any evidence or information to victims – or they’re a victim – to reach out to us so that we can put that case together,” Wilking said. If prosecuted, Wilking said the man could face charges of aggravated assault. “We think that we might have enough to charge him with an aggravated assault at this point,” Wilking said. “But ultimately that decision rests with the DA’s [district attorney] office. We’ll screen those charges and go from there.” If you or someone you know has information or video footage, Wilking said you can call the Salt Lake City Police Department’s non-emergency line at 801-799-3000.

The next morning, he says he received a call from Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown. “He said that’s not the way the police are supposed to act, and he was going to look into it with internal affairs and the review board, and take action,” said Tobin. “I told him whatever you’re going to do is fine with me.” Tobin, who has Leukemia, has a visible scratch on his head from his fall. “My shoulder still hurts a little bit,” he said. “My rib on the back is still sore, but the main problem is my knee.” If given the chance, Tobin shares what he would tell the officer who knocked him down. “I’d just say, I hope you don’t do it again.” Tobin says he is satisfied with his conversation with Chief Brown, and he doesn’t plan on taking any further action.

Floyd's death, ruled a homicide on Monday by a county medical examiner and by an independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family, has sparked outrage nationwide. A bystander's video that showed now-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes has circulated widely since Floyd's Memorial Day death. Chavin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, though Floyd's family wants the former officer charged with first-degree murder. Family attorney Ben Crump on Monday again called for peace. ""Let's remember to take a breath, America,"" Crump said. ""Let's take a breath for George. Let's take breath for peace. Let's take a breath for justice. Let's take a breath to heal our country. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Here's a look at protests from around the nation: Phoenix: Officers kneel, crowd disperses minutes before curfew Cheers of “thank you” and “take a knee!” rang across the crowd in downtown Phoenix as at least three police officers knelt. Just before Phoenix’s 8 p.m. curfew, protesters had negotiated with police: If officers knelt, they said, then the roughly 100 protesters would disperse to their homes. Police obliged. The crowd applauded. “Images like these reflect our willingness to listen and work toward solutions,” Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams tweeted. The gesture capped off an early night for Phoenix protests. The crowd was smaller than previous nights, but included at least 100 outside the Phoenix Police Department headquarters and about 100 advocating outside Fourth Avenue Jail for the release of protesters who had been arrested Sunday. – Arizona Republic Seattle: Police take a knee during protests, later clash with protesters A reporter with KIRO-TV in Washington tweeted two vastly different protest scenes Monday night. The first tweet showed two officers taking a knee with protesters in a show of solidarity. The second, posted almost two hours later, showed a massive crowd of protesters on Capitol Hill clashing with police. Law enforcement officers at the scene used tear gas and spray chemical irritants. The Seattle Times reported downtown businesses could be seeing boarding up windows in anticipation of protests potentially turning violent. Police response:Police across US speak out against actions of Minneapolis police in George Floyd's death Cincinnati: Crowds remain after curfew; protesters, reporter detained Curfew came and went and the crowds remained. Until they were detained. A SWAT vehicle drove behind a group of demonstrators, who had been marching through the city since 1 p.m., with an officer shouting through a megaphone: ""You're in violation of curfew."" At about 8:15 p.m., a group of officers with riot shields marched down the street and began making arrests. Some protesters ran. Others put their hands up. By 10 p.m. local time, streets were largely empty. Patrick Brennan, a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter, was briefly detained by police while covering protests. The Cincinnati Enquirer is part of the USA TODAY Network. Journalists are exempt from the city's curfew. Brennan was released without being charged. The police department later issued a statement on Twitter saying officers were trying to clear the street while rocks were thrown at them. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said the incident was ""a big mistake"" in a statement posted on Twitter. – Sarah Brookbank, Hannah K. Sparling and Keith BieryGolick, Cincinnati Enquirer Louisville, Kentucky: Fire started at site of police shooting of David McAtee Protesters are back in the streets of Louisville on a tumultuous Monday that started with law enforcement officials killing West End ""community pillar"" David McAtee and continued with the firing of the city's police chief, Steve Conrad. Near 11 p.m., a fire was started at Dino's Food Mart, where McAtee was shot. About 100 protesters were at the scene prior to the fire. The fire started before 10:45 p.m. and emergency response teams had swarmed the scene within 5 minutes. A large presence of police and National Guard members were at the site as 11 p.m. approached, with some protesters still in the area holding their ground as well. – Lucas Aulbach and Ben Tobin, Louisville Courier Journal Chicago: Police, rioters clash on Broadway; National Guard deployed Hundreds of Chicago police officers clashed with a small group of young men throwing rocks and pieces of brick on Broadway shortly after the 9 p.m curfew began. Glass bottles shattered on the pavement and cinders crunched underfoot as police officers advanced upon the group, quickly dispersing them with the threat of arrest. At least one young man was taken into custody. Another man, Medhi Akbar, said he was knocked over during the scuffle, showing reporters his bloody face. Protesters shattered several windows along Broadway as they retreated from police, who refrained from using any chemical dispersants. Access to Chicago’s downtown was largely shut down Sunday by authorities after looting and fires in the Loop area, pushing the unrest west and south. Speaking to reporters Monday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot denied that the restrictions and police presence downtown were coming at the expense of other neighborhoods, and promised all areas would be protected equally. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has deployed more than 600 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. – Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Las Vegas: Protesters march peacefully from Trump International on the Strip Several hundred protesters marched from in front of the Trump International Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, along the still-shuttered casinos toward the courthouse in a Black Lives Matter rally. After a short speech a few hours later, a man leading the protest thanked everyone for coming and told everyone to go home. People dispersed. There were police lights flash in the distance, but not an officer in sight. Later, however, Las Vegas police engaged a crowd of people with pepper bullets at Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard. One man was pepper-sprayed: “I can’t breathe,” he’s saying. “I can’t breathe.” – Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal Fort Worth, Texas: SWAT officers pray with protesters after citywide curfew A fourth night of protests in Fort Worth ended peacefully, with police in riot gear kneeling with protesters to pray. The groups remained in dialogue throughout the night, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Hundreds of people lingered outside the Tarrant County courthouse after the 8 p.m. citywide curfew. Police cars began to pull up to the protesters 30 minutes after, announcing that the protesters were in violation of the curfew. Many protesters linked arms and refused to move, then knelt and encouraged the officers to do the same, according to the Star-Telegram. About 9:30 p.m., Police Chief Ed Kraus and officers in riot gear knelt along with protesters. Shortly after, per Kraus's order, SWAT officers left and protesters then began leaving. “You just showed the nation how to do it,” Kraus shouted. The protest ended with no arrests. Kraus had, previously Monday, marched with the protesters, telling the Star-Telegram that organizers have been doing a good job keeping things calm, but outsiders “infiltrated” the protest with a different agenda. – Elinor Aspegren, USA TODAY Memphis, Tennessee: Protesters march downtown ahead of curfew After five consecutive nights of Memphis residents taking to the streets to oppose police brutality, protesters began another march winding through the city's downtown. A small group of demonstrators approached the justice center and a few began screaming at about two dozen officers in riot gear. A glass entryway separates the group from the officers. A larger group of protesters appeared to be moving off in an effort to deescalate the verbal confrontation. Ahead of the city's 10 p.m. curfew, some protesters said they were prepared to be arrested. In one scene at Civic Center Plaza, a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper set down his nightstick at the request of the crowd — and apparent urging from a Memphis police officer. Protesters cheered in response before continuing to march. – Katherine Burgess, Samuel Hardiman, Desiree Stennett, Sarah Macaraeg and Max Garland, The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tenn.) Pittsburgh: Peaceful protest ends with tear gas, smoke for 'bad actors' Violence and destruction marred a peaceful protest outside the Target in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood as people took to the streets for a third straight day to protest the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Hundreds of protesters marched in the streets of East Liberty for more than two hours, but after the official demonstration ended, destruction began. One protester struck the glass at Dollar Bank along Penn Avenue, while others tried to stop him. Protesters were warned to watch out for “bad actors” who might cause destruction. Pittsburgh public safety officials said that a splintered group of protesters began throwing items at police and break windows at the intersection of Centre Avenue and Negley Avenue. In response, police deployed tear gas and smoke to disperse the crowd. – Daveen Rae Kurutz and Chrissy Suttles, The Beaver County Times Los Angeles: Protesters hit Hollywood streets; demonstration ends with arrests About 300 Black Lives Matters protesters jammed the corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood under the gaze of Los Angeles police officers and National Guard troops. Splinter groups headed off down Hollywood Boulevard and other major streets as motorists honked in support. The protest ended with arrests. Surrounding merchants were busy boarding up their businesses in hopes of repelling looters. Later, more than thousand protesters marched through Hollywood in a demonstration that remained peaceful. The crowd included a few men in muscle cars airing their stereos and doing burnouts. One man dressed as Jesus Christ, holding a skateboard aloft along with a sign pointing to a passage in Corinthians. The crowd took over Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. One woman was helping to direct cars that inadvertently got stuck among all the marchers. The demonstration ended with police herding protesters into smaller groups. One group of about 30 were lined up against a shuttered office building on Sunset Boulevard and put into plastic handcuffs, awaiting a trip to jail. – Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY New York City: Looters break away from peaceful march, smash windows As a march with several thousand protesters worked its way toward midtown, a group of several hundred, mostly younger people, broke away and started running downtown. Upon reaching 15th Street, the group smashed the windows of a Verizon Store and looted it. Then the group ran to 14th street and looted a Foot Locker — a store that had been boarded up, but to no avail. Soon after, three police cruisers arrived and chased the group east on 14th Street toward Union Square Park. 'We know people are angry and hurting': 2 New York officers struck by vehicle during George Floyd protests in Buffalo In midtown along 5th Avenue, looters were attacking the Microsoft store at 53rd street. They had already ransacked the Coach store on 54th and 5th which was in the process of being boarded up. Tony Jaggernath, manager of construction crew, said he arrived at the Coach store at 8 p.m. to put up plywood to protect the first-story windows. But they never got a chance to finish. Soon, looters were upon them, ripping down the plywood and throwing stones through the windows and at Jaggernath. ""They came by and ripped off the boards right as we were putting them up,"" Jaggernath said. ""We're not against you, we're just working here,"" Jaggernath said he told the group. Just up the street, Madeline Cisneros of The Bronx stood behind a black police van, surrounded by eight police officers. Her hands were ziptied behind her back, and she looked scared. Her friend Morgan Maselli, 29, also of The Bronx, filmed the police officers as she yelled at them. ""She didn't do anything! Her backpack is filled with water and bandages! She's here to help!"" Maselli said. ""Which of you is the arresting officer? Who's in charge here? What is she being charged with?""

His address in the Rose Garden came as hundreds of protesters surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Trump had yet to appear for his comments as the protesters, who at the time were peaceful, were being pushed back. Trump began his comments by pledging to be a ""law and order"" president as officers continued to push protesters blocks away from where he was standing, using some form of projectiles.

They were released shortly after 9 p.m. They were picked up near city hall along with a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter for a curfew violation. They showed their credentials several times and said they were media. They were detained anyway for about 2 hours on a bus with others picked up for alleged curfew violations. About 9 p.m., police came to the bus and called their names. They will not be charged. Protests in Philadelphia resulted in several arrests after hundreds of protesters stormed I-676 and held up traffic before they were met by law enforcement agencies. The police appeared to use rubber bullets and sprayed protesters with what appeared to be tear gas to disperse the crowd from the highway. The Pennsylvania National Guard was deployed to Philadelphia on Monday after a weekend that saw more than 400 arrests and more than a dozen injured police officers.

Activists spoke through a bullhorn on the steps of the post office, demanding change nationally and locally in response to police killings of black people. Demonstrators chanted “No Justice No Peace” and sang renditions of “Amazing Grace” and “Lean on Me.” Following the rally, demonstrators poured onto the streets of this seaside city about 50 miles south of New York City. – Andrew Goudsward, Asbury Park Press",0.0
1622948750,2020-06-02 01:36:38,Second Night Of Protests In Salt Lake City Mostly Peaceful As Mayor Sets Weeklong Curfew,https://www.kuer.org/post/second-night-protests-salt-lake-city-mostly-peaceful-mayor-sets-weeklong-curfew,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"More than 1,000 protesters marched through the streets of Salt Lake City for the second time in three days, as a new citywide curfew went into effect and Gov. Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency because of civil unrest. Rallying against police violence and calling for racial justice in response to the recent in-custody death of George Floyd, the demonstration remained mostly peaceful as one group of protesters walked the city streets to police headquarters and another headed to the Utah State Capitol. La’Troi Newbins of Salt Lake City helped lead the crowd, calling for justice and highlighting that this march was peaceful. He said he was disappointed to see what happened during the city’s first protest.. “Saturday was a mockery,” he said of a protest over the weekend that later turned violent and destructive. “We’re here for peace. But the real message is, ‘What is going to happen for George Floyd? That’s the whole message. What are they going to do about the officer who murdered him?” The latest protest comes as similar demonstrations in scores of U.S. cities roiled the country and police forces cracked down on curfew violations and faced off with demonstrators. Salt Lake City’s curfew and the governor’s declared state of emergency coincided with a threat from President Donald Trump that if state and local officials didn’t do more to stop the violence and looting in American cities, he would deploy federal troops to achieve that end. Monday’s march began just hours after Salt Lake City Mayor Mendenhall enacted a weeklong citywide curfew, 14 hours after the previous curfew ended. It is in effect nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. through Monday morning, June 8. Herbert declared a state of emergency due to civil unrest that closed the State Capitol Complex to the public through Saturday, June 6 at 11:59 p.m.. “I love our city, and I am so proud of our officers and thankful to the protesters tonight,” Mendenhall tweeted Monday. “There is hurt. There is anger. But there can be progress. I believe that. And I am committed to doing this work together.” The mayor’s decision to establish the new curfew was made in consultation with Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown and Herbert, officials said in a statement. It remains in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. “It is with a heavy heart that we enact another curfew,” Brown said in the statement. “I hope and pray it is the last and that we can do the hard work of building a better city together.” Starting around 6 p.m. at Washington Square near the Salt Lake City and County Building, protesters marched past the City Library to Salt Lake City police headquarters where they were met by a line of waiting officers. Following a developing trend in other major cities, protesters chanted for police to “Kneel with us!” One police officer did just that, making them a deal: “If I take a knee, you have to remain peaceful.” The protest was held by the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Amaal, who asked that her last name not be used for safety reasons, helped set up the event. She said the key to seeing real change comes down to one thing. “Get organized,” Amaal said. “We’re not outnumbered, we’re not out skilled, we’re just out organized. And the minute we start to realize that change will truly start to happen. Look what’s happening across the country. People got together, started to organize, our needs started to be met.” The protests stayed peaceful except for one incident in which a man with a golf club bashed two windows of a National Guard vehicle. Police said one protester carrying a loaded handgun was arrested. Herbert’s emergency order, which follows his activation of the National Guard on Saturday, went into effect Monday and will continue until 11:59 p.m. the following Saturday. Official State business will continue at the Capitol building throughout the closure. The building has been closed to the public since March 14 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",0.0
1622996253,2020-06-01 23:40:36,Utahu2019s Republican hopefuls for governor gang up on Spencer Cox and the Herbert administration,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/06/01/watch-live-utahs/,en,False,,658837,State News - United States - Utah,http://www.utah.statenews.net/,"Three of the four Republican candidates for Utah governor criticized the state’s response to the coronavirus as overbroad on Monday and accused Gov. Gary Herbert of “politicizing” the public health crisis by appointing his chosen successor to head up the response. The jabs thrown during an hourlong debate put Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who leads the state’s coronavirus task force and who a recent poll indicated is the current front-runner, on the defensive for much of the night as the race heats up ahead of the June 30 primary. “Certainly in hindsight there are some things that we could have done differently,” Cox acknowledged during the Utah Debate Commission forum, which was hosted without a live audience at the University of Utah to avoid spreading the illness. “But by and large we have had a tremendous response to this coronavirus crisis.” Utah was one of only seven states that didn’t have a statewide shutdown to stem the spread of the virus, he noted. And he cited a recent study that showed that 45 states had placed more restrictions on the economy and people’s liberties than Utah had, as well as the state’s low hospitalization and mortality rates from the virus as evidence for his cause. Former House Speaker Greg Hughes, who referred to himself throughout the night as the only “true” conservative in the race, views the state’s response differently and criticized a loss of civil liberties caused by government mandates. “A government that tells you what businesses are essential or not, a phone that if it crosses state lines goes off like an Amber Alert asking who you are, where you’re going and what your health status is, communist-style snitch hotlines that have been asked of citizens to engage in, this is borne by fear,” Hughes said. “We never make good decisions out of fear.” Hughes was referencing a state experiment to target text alerts at travelers crossing the state line into Utah — an effort that ended just three days after it started. Travelers were being asked as part of the voluntary survey to answer whether they had experienced symptoms of COVID-19 and where they had been before coming to Utah. Cox’s opponents also took shots throughout the night at the state’s spending of more than $84 million in no-bid contracts and supply orders made outside the normal purchasing rules during the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak. While the lieutenant governor argued those shortcuts were necessary to cope with the urgent need for protective gear and intense international competition over medical equipment, his fellow gubernatorial hopefuls questioned some of the purchases. Article continues below “I think we made a huge mistake by politicizing this whole episode,” said former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. “The Hong Kong flu of 1969 [was] never politicized. The experts ran it.” Were he in charge, Huntsman said he would not have appointed a lieutenant governor who’s running for governor to head the state’s coronavirus response. Instead, he would have left it to health experts like state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn, “who’s perfectly qualified as an expert to handle the situation.” “Instead it was politicized. So what does that do? It leads to $100 million no-transparency deals that still have not been properly explained,” he said. If elected as governor, Hughes said similarly that he would fight for more transparency, noting that there are “a lot of questions” about how purchases were made. He pointed particularly to a state contract for up to $6.35 million with mobile developer Twenty for the launch of Healthy Together, an app that tracks residents’ movements and aims to help public health workers trace where infected people crossed paths with other users. That price tag, he said, seems high in the face of reports that other tech companies had offered to create a similar product for free. “We’re not getting clear answers” about how that contract happened and why “and I think what we learn from this and we don’t do again is we make sure that’s a transparent process,” he said. Among the most controversial state purchases so far was an $800,000 order for hydroxychloroquine from a Utah pharmacist who had amassed the anti-malaria drug and was working behind the scenes with officials to distribute it statewide for coronavirus patients. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert later canceled the order. Cox, in response to Huntsman, decried the politicization of the virus but disagreed with its source, arguing that “the only people playing politics with this disease are the people on this stage.” “In the moment, it’s incredibly difficult and those decisions were being made and influenced at every level by the experts here in the state of Utah,” he continued. Huntsman said the characterization his opponents were the ones who had politicized the coronavirus was “absurd.” “I want to remind people where we’ve been for three months,” he said. “We’ve been locked up in our homes, where the only people able to campaign and politicize have been those in the Governor’s Office, using the platform, using it as a bully pulpit. This is absolutely absurd while we sit under house arrest and try to do our best to run a campaign. That’s how this campaign has proceeded.” In addressing what lessons they’ve learned from the pandemic, Hughes said he would fight as governor for reform on health department orders and state of emergency declarations “so we don’t see our constitutional liberties and some of the behaviors we’ve seen in this pandemic ever happen again.” Former Utah GOP Chairman Thomas Wright, who sought to position himself as the outsider in the race, also expressed a need for more checks and balances and offered support for “guardrails” created by the Legislature. He wants to ensure executive orders “are not the governing rule of the day” and that locally-elected representatives are involved in decision-making. Wright said he thinks the role of government during the pandemic should have been to disseminate information about the coronavirus to help people understand the seriousness of COVID-19 “and allow people to make choices based on their freedoms and liberties” and that he wouldn’t support lockdown orders as governor. “What we need to do in the state of Utah is respect our personal liberties, our personal constitutional rights and do the right thing not because we’re compelled by government to do it but because we know what the right thing is to do and we’ll do it because we have personal responsibility and we believe in doing the right thing,” he said. Civil unrest During the debate, candidates also had the chance to respond to a separate crisis that’s captivated the state’s attention in recent days: the violent protest that emerged in Salt Lake City over the weekend in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The candidates each expressed support for peaceful protest but decried the violence that characterized the demonstration, during which protesters set two cars on fire and threw rocks at the windows of businesses and cars while police responded with rubber bullets and arrests. “The rioters, those that look to prey upon the weak, those that try to create fear, civil unrest, break the law, that isn’t what this is about,” Hughes said. “That’s not the protest or the feelings that we all as a nation felt and that is what has to be dealt with head on.” Cox, who decried Floyd’s “murder” and said there is “no place for police brutality in America, said the protests reflect “real frustration, especially in our black community — those who for generations have felt this type of discrimination.” At the same time, the lieutenant governor recognized frustration within police departments that feel they’re not getting the support from elected officials “that they deserve.” “We also lost one of Utah’s finest in Ogden this past week and we must remember how difficult these jobs are for the men and women in law enforcement,” he said. “They deserve our support and they are working around the clock to stop these rioters and these looters and to protect the property and lines of Utahns. Even those that are protesting.” Huntsman, in answering a question about how he would respond to President Donald Trump’s call for governors to take an aggressive stand against the demonstrations, also expressed support for police officers. “I’d have a conversation with the president like I have on many occasions,” he said. “We shoot straight with each other, I’ve got a good relationship with him. But I would ask first and foremost are we doing enough to thank law enforcement for putting their lives on the line? Are we doing enough to thank them and their families for the restraint that was shown in the face of anarchy?” Wright, in addressing the protests, said they reflect a frustration among many about the lack of leadership on issues like racial inequality. If elected, he said he would direct the state’s Commissioner of Public Safety to ensure all new and future officers are trained adequately “so that they’re listening and learning and we’re being compassionate with each other and we can take action on racial inequality.” “We can even discuss a course for current police officers; I know they want to be a part of the solution and they should have an equal opportunity” to engage in that curriculum through the Peace Officer Standard and Training (POST) council.",0.0

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

1623116208,2020-06-02 05:01:00,Tuesday's Primaries: Races To Watch And Live Results,https://www.kuer.org/post/tuesdays-primaries-races-watch-and-live-results,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"With everything going in the country — from the unrest in many cities after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police to the coronavirus pandemic — it's easy to have missed that elections are being held. But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said Rita Hart is an Iowa state senator. She is a former Iowa state senator. Copyright 2020 NPR.

1623127986,2020-06-02 05:57:00,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.kuer.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623127985,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.kuer.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

1623127984,2020-06-02 06:23:00,"One Week After George Floyd's Death, Protests Continue Across The Country",https://www.kuer.org/post/one-week-after-george-floyds-death-protests-continue-across-country,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"Updated at 11:44 a.m. ET One week after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody, demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism continued across the United States. Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death.

1623204115,2020-06-02 08:00:00,In our opinion: America must scrub racism from its heart,https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/6/2/21277381/protest-george-floyd-utah-state-capitol-salt-lake-city-racism,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"Racism in the United States is an insidious sickness, a stain baked into some corners of society that has defied decades of efforts to scrub clean. The death of George Floyd is a sickening and inexplicable example. Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby shop. Video clearly shows a police officer kneeling on his neck while Floyd, lying on the street, repeatedly complains that he cannot breathe. Finally, he goes limp, but the officer continues to kneel on his neck until paramedics arrive. In a separate incident last week, a widely circulated video shows a white woman in Central Park who calls police to report being threatened by a man who was asking her to leash her dog, repeatedly telling police her assailant is an African American man. The man, a birdwatcher equipped with binoculars, can be heard speaking calmly as he records her reaction. The nation has seen far too many similar examples in its history, and especially at a time when more enlightened attitudes ought to prevail. Smartphones and social media are today bringing to light things that one day might have been dismissed as hearsay or unreliable testimony. The videos are shocking and difficult to watch but, for the sake of the nation, they must lead to change. The United States needs a concerted effort, from the top echelons of statehouses and the White House to boardrooms, pulpits and, ultimately, kitchen tables, to finally come to grips with this sickness that has been the root of so many of our nation’s troubles. To do so, Americans must separate this issue from the riots that have besieged cities from coast to coast, including Salt Lake City on Saturday. Peaceful protests are a cherished part of America’s trust in freedom and self-government. In this case, even angry protest is understandable as a response to injustice and brutality. But vandalism — the torching of cars and buildings, the victimization of innocent people and the desecration of the symbols of government by the people, such as the Utah state Capitol — is not. Injustice is a poor weapon against injustice. Utahns who were stunned by what happened Saturday afternoon and evening should take heart by what happened Sunday, as groups of volunteers began flowing into the city to pick up trash and scrub away spray paint. Related Volunteers help clean up after turbulent protest in Salt Lake City Allyson Gamble, executive director of the Capitol Preservation Board, told the Deseret News of professional cleaners who told her they couldn’t sleep after watching the destruction on television. They told her “they just wanted to come here and help because we’re Utahns and we band together.” Whether consciously or not, these people exemplify the attitude all Americans must have as they deal with these and related issues. Yes, Utahns have a history of banding together. Americans as a whole band together against common enemies. But what the United States needs now is for all people to feel the same urgency to end racism, in all its forms, that the Utah volunteers felt when they rushed to Salt Lake City to clean what vandals left behind. What we all need is an understanding that these evils are the moral equivalent of spray-painting graffiti on the Constitution and all our cherished values. What we need is a compulsion to clean our collective hearts.",0.0

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man’s neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from violence, vandalism and arson to heavy-handed riot police tactics. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest. Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees. The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far: Louisville As local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city’s police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.” The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. ___ Oakland A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___ Indianapolis Two people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city. ___ Minneapolis In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___ Omaha, Nebraska A 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense. ___ Detroit A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. ___ Chicago suburb Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

""Let me be clear: The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese without permission as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde told CNN. ""And to do so... he sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard. I am outraged,"" Budde said.

""The president did not pray when he came to St. John’s, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now, and in particular, the people of color in our nation who wonder if anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred work, and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and white supremacy in our country,"" Budde said.

The demonstration, organized over social media by the group Party for Socialism and Liberation, began about 6 p.m., when police began receiving reports of large crowds gathering downtown near the site of Saturday’s upheaval. As the number of demonstrators began to swell, police moved quickly to stay ahead of the crowds, blocking streets and pedestrian traffic for several square blocks. While the majority of protesters massed near the city’s Public Safety Building, the City Library and Washington Square, police paid close attention to smaller groups of people who left the main protest and made their way into the downtown area. In a protracted game of cat-and-mouse, squads of heavily armed officers made their way through alleys and side streets tracking the potential troublemakers. Police said some of those who left the main protest actually appeared to have changed clothes. Salt Lake City PD released a statement early Monday night, saying one demonstrator had been arrested carrying a loaded handgun. Police also shared photos of an armored vehicle with its windows shattered. At 8 p.m. police informed the crowds the city’s newly imposed curfew was in effect. They were told to disband or risk arrest and most appeared to comply. Hundreds of others, however, made their way to the perimeter of the Utah statehouse where they were met by dozens of baton-wielding UHP officers. A military chopper circled overhead. When the crowd refused to disperse, officers moved on them, knocking demonstrators to the ground. The seemingly stunned protesters moved back down State Street and marched into downtown, where approximately 200 soon found themselves surrounded by police near South Temple and State Street. After a few tense moments, organizers asked if the crowd could simply go home and police agreed. Several protesters decided to defy the curfew order and were taken into custody without incident. Police have yet to announce the number of arrests or the amount of property damage done. Gephardt Daily will update this story as more information is made available.",0.0
1623358614,2020-06-02 11:09:28,Americans recognize racial inequality. But will that lead to change?,https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/6/2/21278047/scott-rasmussen-america-racial-inequality-recognition-change-protests-george-floyd,en,True,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"Alexis de Tocqueville began his classic study of “Democracy in America” with an observation that seems especially jarring today. As a European visiting early 19th-century America, he said that nothing struck his “eye more vividly than the equality of conditions.” He was aware, of course that some people were wealthier or more influential than others, but he was describing an underlying sense of perceived societal equality. As he sought to explain the young nation for his readers, de Tocqueville described that equality as a central feature needed to understand the United States. The Frenchman, however, was keenly aware that his analysis focused only on white society. He wrote that the “cause of the present troubles and future dangers” for our nation would come from the evil of slavery and its consequences. A generation after de Tocqueville’s analysis, the Civil War legally abolished slavery. But he foresaw that the legal barrier was only part of the problem: “Racial prejudice appears to me stronger in the states that have abolished slavery.” Sadly, no observer today would describe equality of conditions as a defining feature of our nation. And, as the death of George Floyd proved once again, we are still coming to grips with the horrific legacy of slavery and its consequences. A national public opinion survey I conducted in recent days shows that the reality of racial inequality is recognized. Only 21% of voters believe that law enforcement agencies treat white Americans and black Americans equally. Sixty-two percent (62%) recognize that white Americans receive better treatment while 15% are not sure. Two percent (2%) bizarrely believe that black Americans are treated better. Not surprisingly, black voters are even more pessimistic in their assessment. Eighty-three percent (83%) believe whites receive better treatment from law enforcement while only 11% see equality. The following numbers are the natural result of that perceived inequality: If they were approached by a police officer while walking down the street alone, 72% of black Americans would be nervous. That includes 39% who would be very nervous. Among white Americans, only 11% would be very nervous and another 28% somewhat nervous. It’s important to recognize that these numbers are not just about lower-income or poorly educated black Americans. If alone and approached by a police officer, 1 out of every 4 college educated black voters would be very nervous! Among college educated white voters, only 1 in 10 would be so stressed. The numbers reminded me of a long-ago conversation with Harvey Gantt, the first African American admitted to Clemson University and the first black mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. Gantt told us he always dressed well when going to the hardware store. Why? So they wouldn’t think he was shoplifting! Gantt’s concern — and the concern felt by many when police approach — is understandable when 27% of black Americans say they have been falsely accused of a crime. The numbers are depressingly similar for the inequality issued by judges and courts. But it’s important to recognize that this is not just a problem with our legal system. It is a problem with our society. Only 31% believe most Americans treat whites and blacks equally in day-to-day life. Only 19% of black Americans believe that to be the case. Against the backdrop of these depressing numbers and realities, there is a bit of encouraging news in the survey. By an 82% to 4% margin, voters believe that the officers involved should be arrested (most of the survey was conducted prior to the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the rest shortly thereafter). Among those following the story very closely, 96% favored the arrest and only 1% were opposed. When faced with the reality of racial discrimination — with video of a white police officer choking the life out of a black man — Americans are repulsed. That’s good. But for tens of millions of white Americans it will be just another moment in an endless series of ever shorter news cycles. When reminded of it, they will be sickened. But it won’t bring about change. These are the difficulties de Tocqueville anticipated long ago. They are the same challenges faced by Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. They are the reason we live in a nation where only 18% rate race relations as good or excellent. It’s good that just about everybody believes a white police officer should be arrested for the senseless killing of a black man. But what will we do — how will we change — to create a future where just about everybody believes race relations are good?

An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ‘Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this ... again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said.

Nelson speaking during The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' twice-annual church conference Saturday, April 4, 2020, in Salt Lake City. (Photo: Uncredited, AP) The president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints denounced racism and the violence occurring at protests around the country in the faith's first public statement Monday since volatile weekend demonstrations over the death of George Floyd. Russell M. Nelson said in a post to his social media accounts that the Utah-based religion joined with people around the world being “deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life."" “We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin,"" wrote Nelson. “We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest.” He added: “Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent!” Nelson went on to say that “illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil.” In Salt Lake City, protesters flipped over and burned a police car and damaged buildings Saturday. More than 40 people were arrested. Floyd, a black man, died last Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, has been trying to improve race relations in recent decades, including calling out white supremacy and launching a new formal alliance with the NAACP, but some black church members and scholars say discriminatory opinions linger in some congregations. The faith banned black men from being in the religion's lay priesthood until 1978 in a prohibition that was rooted in a belief that black skin was a curse. In a 2013 essay, the church disavowed the reasons behind the ban and condemned all racism, saying the prohibition came during an era of great racial divide that influenced early church teachings. Blacks were always allowed to be members, but the nearly century-long ban kept them from participating in many important rituals. Accusations of racism against the church had reached a peak in the 1960s, as civil rights activists targeted church-owned Brigham Young University with demonstrations and boycotts. The Utah-based religion doesn’t provide ethnic or racial breakdowns of its members, but scholars say blacks make up a small portion of the 16-million member global faith. “We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause,” Nelson wrote. “And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation. I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect, and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children.” Read or Share this story: https://www.thespectrum.com/story/news/2020/06/02/mormon-president-nelson-denounces-racism-escalating-violence/5317090002/",0.0

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began.

1623432470,2020-06-02 05:00:00,Sports Figures Add Their Voices To Those Of Angry Protesters,https://www.upr.org/post/sports-figures-add-their-voices-those-angry-protesters,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"Sports are part of the fabric of American society, and often they've provided a medium for athlete protest. In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623432419,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.upr.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,236024,upr.org,http://upr.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began.

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

Bringhurst was also part of a march made up of around 5,000 people that shut down both sides of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge as well as one direction of a federal highway.

Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania offers the day’s biggest trove of delegates and represents a high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in one of the most important general election battlegrounds. “We think we’re prepared,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. “Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don’t know where we’ll be with the pandemic in November.” Joe Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination, but his role as his party’s clear presidential nominee is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates later in the month if necessary. Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. It’s much the same in Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be arrested should their city’s 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth consecutive night. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Another state holding primary elections, Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and focused on other offices.",0.0

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board.

Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask.

Two men with numerous weapons who were allegedly on their way to the protests in Salt Lake City were arrested Monday. Four weapons — including an AK-47 and an Uzi with a silencer attached — were recovered from a vehicle, Vainuku said. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. “We had every reason to believe that’s what they intended to do,” Vainuku said. Silva had posted “multiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City police” over social media and “encouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,” she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. “In one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, ‘Hands up don’t shoot,’” while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. “The suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise ‘we will have no choice but to affiliate you with your ... colleagues and their actions.’ “The suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, ‘You put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,’” according to the affidavit. Four additional firearms were found in Silva’s home, police said. “The suspect denied wanting to shoot police officers but admitted his Facebook posts were intended to incite people,” the affidavit states. Christian Hernandez, 27, of Magna, was also in the car with Silva at the time of his arrest. “The suspect admitted he was headed to the current protests in Salt Lake City,” police wrote in an affidavit. Marijuana and “four firearms, including three long rifles and one handgun,” were found in the vehicle, the affidavit states. Hernandez was arrested for investigation of possession of a firearm by a restricted person and drug possession. In Salt Lake City at the state Capitol and the streets around the Salt Lake City-County Building, most of the arrests Monday were for failing to obey the city’s mandatory 8 p.m. curfew. But at least one protester was arrested for having a loaded gun, according to police. Grid View A barricade blocks 200 East near the Salt Lake City and County Building on Tuesday, June 2, 2020.

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Roger Nuankdo Dyujay, 21, of Salt Lake City, was arrested about 9 p.m. Monday for investigation of aggravated assault, carrying a concealed weapon and failing to disperse. Dyujay was with a crowd of protesters at 400 South and 300 East. As the crowd moved north on 300 East, Dyujay “began to strike the ground with a golf club” and then “threw a water bottle and rocks, hitting officers on the crowd control line. (He) was yelling and inciting the crowd to not follow orders to disperse,” according to a police booking affidavit. Dyujay ran off, and then got into a car and tried to drive away but was stopped by police. He then ran to a nearby parking structure where he was arrested. Officers found a loaded .380 handgun in Dyujay’s pocket, That was the most serious arrest from Monday night. The Deseret News counted at least 17 arrests, though Salt Lake police were still tallying the total number on Tuesday. Rebekkah Ann Hamilton, 23, was arrested for investigation of failing to disperse and indecent public display after she was found at the state Capitol “protesting fully nude while in the presence of a child,” according to an affidavit. Morgan Burns Pitcher, 24, was also arrested for investigation of failing to disperse and violating curfew when he was given a 15-minute warning to leave the Capitol grounds but did not, another police affidavit says. Noel Boyohit Lokiru, 20, of Salt Lake City, was arrested for investigation of failing to disperse and interfering with an arresting officer after police say he “remained unlawfully in an active riot” but then tried to run once police attempted to arrest him. Adman Warren Eugene, 39, was arrested for investigation of failing to disperse and interfering with an arresting officer after police say he did not leave the Capitol grounds as ordered and then tried to interfere with an officer making an arrest. That officer sustained “several scrapes and abrasions to his hands and arms,” a police affidavit states. Others arrested for suspicion of failing to disperse included Keita K. Pantaleon, 33; Deysi Radilla-Marintez, 19; Michael Kennion Brown, 21; Taylar Brooke Jackson, 26; Harland Eldredge, 27; Kayla Jewell Villamor, 27; Jason Spencer Vance, 38; Benjamin Noah Soto, 20; Steve Jonathan Rosales, 29; Destiny Julisa Romero, 21; Charlotte May Jones, 22; Jemal Ruben Knowles, 50; and Mikaeli Rose Lechuga, 22. Salt Lake police said two juvenile teens who were violating curfew and failing to disperse were also cited at the scene Monday night. In another case, Samuel M. Hubble, 30, was arrested for investigation of possession of a deadly weapon with intent to assault and having a loaded firearm on the street. That investigation began about 7 p.m. when a Utah Transit Authority police officer heard a gunshot coming from the area of 200 South and 300 East. He then spotted a man carrying an AR-15 near a residence, according to a police affidavit. “At the time the firearm was fired, Salt Lake City was the site of several protests with hundreds of people occupying the city streets,” the affidavit notes. Officers detained Hubble, searched his house and found “a Smith and Wesson M&P 15 .223-caliber rifle on the inside of the front door,” according to the affidavit. The gun was loaded. On Monday, the Utah chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police criticized Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall for not properly thanking officers who helped with the riots on Saturday the resulted in at least two police cars being damaged and numerous officers hurt, many by having rocks or bricks thrown at them. But by Monday night, the chapter released another statement thanking the mayor for making things right. “We asked her to call injured officers, and she has begun to do so. We asked her to keep officers’ safety as a priority, and she said as much in justifying the ongoing curfew. We asked her to show humility in the face of the sacrifices agencies and officers made, and she has penned a letter to valley chiefs, thanking them for their willingness to immediately send their officers into harm’s way when asked to do so. We sincerely thank Mayor Mendenhall for being willing to make public safety a priority, and to move ahead together to secure the stability and quality of life that make this state such an amazing place.”",0.0

Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports that demonstrators gathered outside the city’s police headquarters Monday and convinced several officers to kneel with them. Police fired a few rubber bullets to disperse the crowd later that night. Salt Lake City police said in a tweet that the window of an armored vehicle was shattered. Several people also were arrested, including someone carrying a loaded handgun. The protests weren’t nearly as volatile as those on Saturday. The mayor has extended curfew until next Monday.",0.0
1623565600,2020-06-02 09:08:01,Gary Leimback: Take the reason for the protests seriously,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/gary-leimback-take-reason/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"On Saturday, Americans demonstrated their priorities. An amazing launch of the first manned rocket in years from Cape Canaveral comes in fourth place in terms of importance to Americans. The economic disaster created by the coronavirus competes with the virus itself for second place as Americans struggle with the conflict: Is our economy more important than our health? Intelligence tells us that our health is more important. But many people having been cooped up in quarantine for the last four to eight weeks. Americans are an active, energetic people. The quarantine created a tinderbox of people anxious to get out and feel like they are living again. We found out this last week that Americans, true to character, really put politics in first priority, more important than health, economy or space flight, especially when protesting a televised injustice of racial police violence in Minnesota. Utah is fortunate to have Salt Lake City and County police leaders smart enough to use a brilliant strategy of peacefully allowing protesters to protest as they wanted Saturday while moving the crowd to eventually go home. The protesters who stayed to the end were arrested peacefully. There were 41 arrests. Some protesters were injured, several police officers were injured. Mayor Erin Mendenhall is initiating a review of all police actions. But, importantly, there were no deaths. It was an instance of no police brutality, of which all Utahns can be proud. As I watched the whole drama on television, it struck me that the basic character of Utahns is one of peace and compassion. Being the home of a major religion has had a good effect on our population. Having patted the police on the back and complimented Utah character, it is still important to take seriously what protesters were all about. As statistics pile up, we find African Americans and Latinos often at the bottom of the economic ladder and disproportionately filling our jails and prisons. It is easy for some of our leaders to blame the violence on anarchists, people from out of state and extremists. But this is just a ruse to allow us to not feel responsible for our own racism. There is a strong current of racism that seems to be built into white Americans. The history of slavery in America has long tentacles. The one fellow who wanted to protest the protest Saturday in Salt Lake can only be judged as foolish for bringing a bow and arrow and pointing it at some of the protesters. Protestors jumped him, beating him up. They then flipped his car over and set it on fire. Those who are white nationalists fail to understand one crucial fact. White people own and run most of the big businesses in America and hold many of the political offices. White people already are the privileged race in America. If this were a race, the white people have already won it. This makes the white nationalist movement absurd. The deeper problem is that there is much poverty among whites who for one reason or another feel left out of the bounty of being an American. This is a very real problem and fuels President Trump’s base. What kept being repeated on television Saturday was that the race problem in America can only be solved by changing America’s culture. As life has moved from the race and environmental movements of the 1960s to the acceptance of gay marriage and the anti-gun movements of teenagers (who try not to be shot while attending school) of the 2020s, considerable social and cultural progress has been made. Article continues below The undercurrent of racism that we all have must constantly be fought against. White people (of which I am one) must constantly go out of our way to treat others of all races with grace and love (as Christ commands) and civility and kindness (which democracy demands). Changing our culture to eliminate racism means changing our hearts. But it also means being conscious and self-aware of our thoughts, feelings and actions as we interact with other people every day. American values are built around freedom and equality. As we live, we must constantly think about treating others as equals and what that means. Gary Leimback",0.0
1623565592,2020-06-02 09:08:53,Paul Krugman: Trump takes us to the brink,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/paul-krugman-trump-takes/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"Last fall Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis police union, appeared at a Trump rally, where he thanked the president for ending Barack Obama’s “oppression of police” and letting cops “put the handcuffs on criminals instead of us.” The events of the past week, in which the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody led to demonstrations against police brutality, and these demonstrations were met by more police brutality — including unprecedented violence against the news media — have made it clear what Kroll meant by taking the handcuffs off. And Donald Trump, far from trying to calm the nation, is pouring gasoline on the fire; he seems very close to trying to incite a civil war. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that America as we know it is on the brink. How did we get here? The core story of U.S. politics over the past four decades is that wealthy elites weaponized white racism to gain political power, which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already wealthy at workers’ expense. Until Trump’s rise it was possible — barely — for people to deny this reality with a straight face. At this point, however, it requires willful blindness not to see what’s going on. I still see occasional news reports that describe Trump as a “populist.” But Trump’s economic policies have been the opposite of populist: They have been relentlessly plutocratic, centered largely on a successful effort to ram through huge tax cuts for corporations and the rich, and a so far unsuccessful attempt to take health insurance away from poor and working-class families. Nor have Trump’s trade wars brought back the good jobs of yore. Even before the coronavirus plunged us into depression, Trump had failed to deliver major employment growth in coal mining or manufacturing. And farmers, who supported Trump by large margins in 2016, have suffered huge losses thanks to his trade wars. So what has Trump really offered to the white working class that makes up most of his base? Basically, he has provided affirmation and cover for racial hostility. And nowhere is this clearer than in his relationship with the police. If economic self-interest were the only thing driving political orientation, you would expect police officers to favor Democrats. They are, after all, unionized public-sector employees — and Republicans are both anti-union and anti-government. They don’t make enough money to benefit much from the Trump tax cut. Their jobs will be very much at risk if revenue-starved state and local governments are forced to make drastic spending cuts — and Trump’s allies in the Senate are blocking the aid that might avert such cuts. Article continues below Indeed, political contributions by public-sector unions overwhelmingly favor Democrats. And while many firefighters voted for Trump in 2016, the largest firefighters’ union has endorsed Joe Biden. But many police officers and their unions remain staunch Trump supporters, and they have been pretty clear about why: They feel that Trump will back them even, or perhaps especially, if they engage in abusive behavior toward racial minorities. Just to be clear, many and probably most police officers have behaved well over the past week. In fact, in some cities the police have shown solidarity with protesters, joining marches or taking a knee. But Trump clearly sides with those who reject any notion that police officers — or any other authority figures — should be held accountable for abusive behavior. Remember, he’s used his authority to pardon members of the U.S. military who were accused or convicted by their own services of committing war crimes. In a call with governors on Monday, he showed no sign of recognizing either that there might be some justification for widespread protests or that he should play some role in unifying the nation. Instead, he told the governors that all the violence was coming from the “radical left,” and he insisted that governors must get tougher: “You have to dominate or you’ll look like a bunch of jerks; you have to arrest and try people.” Trump — who retreated to an underground bunker when protesters began demonstrating in front of the White House — also told the governors that “most of you are weak.” It was a terrifying performance. Republicans have, as I said, spent decades exploiting racial hostility to win elections despite a policy agenda that hurts workers. But Trump is now pushing that cynical strategy toward a kind of apotheosis. On one side, he’s effectively inciting violence by his supporters. On the other, he’s very close to calling for a military response to social protest. And at this point, nobody expects any significant pushback from other Republicans. Now, I don’t think Trump will actually succeed in provoking a race war in the near future, even though he’s clearly itching for an excuse to use force. But the months ahead are still likely to be very, very ugly. After all, if Trump is encouraging violence and talking about military solutions to overwhelmingly peaceful protests, what will he and his supporters do if he looks likely to lose November’s election?

1623565587,2020-06-02 09:09:24,Jennifer Senior: What Trump and toxic cops have in common,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/jennifer-senior-what/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"In his first Inaugural Address, and hopefully his last, Donald Trump talked about American carnage. He got it last week. What we couldn’t have known in January 2017 is that he wasn’t here to save us from this carnage, but to perpetuate it; that incitement wasn’t just a feature of his campaign, but of his governance. When historians look back at the Trump era, they may very well say his presidency was encapsulated by this moment, when a sadistic cop knelt on the neck of an African American man in plain view for almost 9 minutes and the streets exploded in rage. Derek Chauvin was by no means the first cop to gratuitously brutalize and lynch an African American. But he embodied something essential about Trumpism: It’s us versus them. That’s the poison ethos at the heart of police brutality, and it’s the septic core of our 45th president’s philosophy. Neither a toxic cop nor Donald Trump sees himself as a servant of all the people they’ve sworn to protect. They are solely servants of their own. Everyone else is the enemy. From the beginning, the police have received a lot of perverse messages from Trump, encouraging them to embrace the bitter angels of their nature. Three summers ago, he gave a speech on Long Island, disparaging officers who cradled the heads of suspects as they tucked them into their squad cars: “You can take the hand away, OK?” (A bank of cops, seated behind him, started to laugh and cheer.) One of Trump’s most revealing tweets since the rioting began was a boast about the prowess of the Secret Service — and to threaten to sic “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons” on the crowds outside the White House if things intensified. He’s Bull Connor with a comb-over. Or Walter E. Headley, Miami’s former police chief, who in 1967 said, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase that reappeared in a Trump tweet Friday. And this is the point, is it not? Trump, who made his political bones by peddling apocrypha about our first African American president’s country of origin, thrives on racial divisions. Us-them. Conflict zones are his comfort zone, perfect for firing up his base. But the pressures of this historic moment proved to be too much. We can’t see the African Americans who are dying in disproportionate numbers inside our hospitals, but we can see George Floyd, an African American, cruelly singled out for asphyxiation in the street. His death in police custody is a potent symbol of the obscene inequality and racial hostility of this moment, with the police officer as Trump’s smirking and pitiless proxy. African Americans — and many whites, too — were so enraged that they poured out into the streets to protest, even in the midst of a pandemic, even though African Americans are most at risk in this pandemic. A month from now, it’s quite likely many will end up in hospitals, once again in disproportionate numbers. It’s too awful to contemplate. And once again, there’s a leadership vacuum in response to the chaos, just as there is with COVID-19. It’s every state for itself, with Trump trolling the most liberal leaders for their supposed failures to contain the unrest. How these protests devolved into violence across the country will be the subject of analysis for years to come. For now, what has riveted me is that somehow, in spite of the dystopian horror unfolding in front of us, in spite of execrable responses from some of the largest police forces in the country (including New York City’s), we’re nonetheless hearing talk of America as a perfectible place — of the arc still bending. It’s been more than three years since we’ve heard that tune. Yet there was Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, issuing a wee-hours statement that asked Americans not to ignore their pain, but to use it “to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity.” There was Killer Mike, the rapper from Atlanta, reminding his fellow citizens, “Atlanta’s not perfect, but we’re a lot better than we ever were, and a lot better than cities are.” Conservatives will focus on the pleas for law and order in their messages. But what I hear is a repudiation of Trumpian nihilism — a rejection of the tyranny of the perpetual “anxious present” that Masha Gessen describes in her forthcoming book “Surviving Autocracy.” They’re instead speaking with what Gessen calls “moral ambition,” inviting fellow citizens to build a more expansive country, rather than an us-versus-them one. Their messages weren’t, “Don’t destroy your community,” so much as, “There’s a still community left for you to join. Come and make it better.” Article continues below And so, along with terrifying imagery of fire and fury, we also saw images over the weekend of police officers and protesters marching together. The bonds were sometimes fragile, only to later disappear. But they happened. In Flint, Michigan. In Camden, New Jersey. In Coral Gables, Florida. In Santa Clara, California. In Ferguson, Missouri. In Kansas City, Missouri, where two cops, one white, held aloft a sign saying “End Police Brutality.” Or listen to the chief of police in Atlanta, Erika Shields, tell an anxious protester, “I hear you.” When Trump met with those who’d lost loved ones in the Parkland shooting, he needed an empathy cheat sheet that contained those very words; it was item No. 5. For her, they simply spilled out, as naturally as rain. (The New York Times) Jennifer Senior",0.0

Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities' actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president's heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Article continues below Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won't either."" But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division."" “I won't fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. ""I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.”",0.0

How many black folks are in Salt Lake City, Utah?” Lee said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. “And let’s take into account that the NBA is not playing. The Utah Jazz are not playing!” laughed Lee, famously a New York Knicks fan. “I’ve been very encouraged by the diversity of the protesters [nationwide]. I haven’t seen this diverse protests since when I was a kid,” Lee said, citing the movements of the ’60s. “I’m encouraged that my white sisters and brothers are out there. “That is the hope of this country, this diverse, younger generation of Americans who don’t want to perpetuate the same [expletive] that their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents got caught up in. That’s my hope.” On Monday, Lee released a short film titled “3 Brothers” that speaks to Floyd’s death last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck as he begged for air. The officer has since been charged with murder. In the short film, Lee juxtaposes Floyd’s death with that of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died in 2014 in a police chokehold, saying “I can’t breathe” — a phrase that has become a rallying cry for people protesting police brutality. In the film, Lee compares both real-life deaths with a fictional one: That of Radio Raheem, the character played by Bill Nunn in Lee’s 1989 movie “Do the Right Thing.” Raheem dies from a police chokehold, and his death sparks a riot in New York’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Lee modeled the chokehold that kills Raheem on the murder of Michael Stewart, a graffiti artist who was killed by New York City police officers in 1983.

Throughout America today we hear the sounds of a nation torn apart by the devil of racism.” In an auditorium in a part of town that had erupted over the weekend in response to the death of a black man in police custody in Minnesota, roughly 100 black, white and Hispanic members of the New Season church raised sanitized hands toward heaven. “Yes!” they shouted. “Amen!” As nationwide protests against the police killing of George Floyd entered their sixth day, the terror of death by coronavirus intersected Sunday with rage over a different disease — police killings of African American people — settling, for many, the question over when to emerge from America’s long national quarantine. In communities across the country, many congregations that had sequestered for months in fear of catching or spreading the lethal coronavirus ventured forth at a social distance in search of comfort. More than half of the states have continued to allow religious gatherings, but many churches, synagogues and mosques, for safety’s sake, have chosen for months to make do with Zoom sermons and livestreams. Many stuck to remote services Sunday, but a significant number returned to public worship driven by a combination of pain, prayer and political expression. In Pennsylvania, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia resumed public Mass, but with churches restricted to half-occupancy, and every other pew empty. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints resumed some in-person services in Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Illinois, Utah and a number of other locations, but chose not to reopen temples in Nevada, Hawaii, Washington and other states. In California, at least a dozen evangelical churches made a coordinated return timed to Pentecost, a day of Christian jubilation that many regard as the church’s birthday. Some in that group were also seeking to pressure the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, into dropping a 100-person cap on church attendance and other rules enacted to curb the pandemic as the state’s coronavirus case count soared past 100,000, with 4,000 deaths. Several significant outbreaks started in churches. The state’s right to restrict church attendance during the crisis was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court late Friday. “Obviously we’re disappointed with the court’s ruling,” said Pastor Jim Domen, the founder of Church United, a group that had mobilized more than 1,500 pastors against California’s emergency restrictions. “But we report to a higher authority.” In Fresno, California, 350 congregants registered to attend a socially distanced service at Cornerstone Church, whose pastor earlier in the week had compared Mr. Newsom to Soviet leaders who had propped up the Berlin Wall. Article continues below But at the Water of Life Community Church in Fontana, where some 320 people had reserved tickets for a return on Sunday, Pastor Dan Carroll said on a livestream that the church was reconsidering its plan, and had decided “to try to comply and pray that he changes his mind in the next two weeks,” referring to Mr. Newsom. The sanctuary did open, but only about 100 people per service were allowed to enter. In Sacramento, Rodriguez and his members sang mostly without masks, in violation of state directives, but turned away some worshippers, trying to keep the crowd under 100. His point, he said, was not to criticize the governor, but to stand with his church. Robert H. Tyler, the lawyer representing the churches and pastors who signed the petition, cited growing rates of anxiety and depression, as well as the national unrest, as a justification for not complying with the Supreme Court decision. “Let’s give an outlet for people to meet in churches as an alternative to shutting down freeways and burning down buildings,” the statement said. In Sacramento, still raw from the 2018 police killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed young black man, the return to worship was set against multiple social flashpoints. Rodriguez said New Season had been planning to return from quarantine Sunday for several weeks. His motives were not as political as those of some ministers, he said — he delivered one of the prayers at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, but likes to say that his parishioners “worship the lamb, not the elephant or the donkey.” But he also disapproved of Newsom’s church guidelines, saying the cap on attendance was punitive for a 1,000-seat church like his. Also punitive, he said, was the state’s ban on church singing, a precaution against the airborne spread of the virus. (Max Whittaker | The New York Times) Worshippers during service at the New Season church in Sacramento, Calif., May 31, 2020. More than half of the states have continued to allow religious gatherings, but many churches, synagogues and mosques, for safetyÕs sake, have chosen for months to make do with Zoom sermons and livestreams, but many stuck to remote services on Sunday, but a significant number returned to public worship driven by a combination of pain, prayer and political expression. Then came the national fury at Floyd’s death. On the day before New Season’s service, nearly 1,000 demonstrators wielding Black Lives Matter signs converged on California’s state Capitol. As night fell, crowds swarmed the freeways and the Sacramento Kings’ glistening sports arena, defacing a landmark sculpture by artist Jeff Koons and looting nearby department stores. The pain was especially sharp at New Season, where the congregation is 40% black, 40% white and 20% Hispanic. Patricia Littlejohn, a church volunteer, said she had sought to tune out the violence, but that it had evoked painful memories of Clark’s shooting. Coming on top of the pandemic, which cost her job at a health club, she said the unrest left her feeling isolated. Gesturing to her fellow congregants, who were trying not to hug even as other volunteers entreated them to keep 7 feet of space between them, Littlejohn smiled. “This,” she said, “means everything.” In the front row, Mercedes Ray, a member of the church board, said the explosion of violence compelled churches to act. “What has happened out there is that people feel backed into a corner. They feel they’re not being heard and that nothing has been done.” That concern echoed with particular force among African American churchgoers, at the epicenter both of the fury over Floyd’s death and of the toll of the coronavirus. Out of caution, many African American churches held services with pastors preaching to empty sanctuaries and virtual congregations — even on a day when they would have wanted to be together most. “I think the church has to help make sure it is a wake-up call,” said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the senior pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, New York, who kept his parish online Sunday. “The church has had to be a safety net for a society that has ignored the community,” he said. “It’s like you pull back the covers and saw all the years of inequity and, to some degree, racist disregard for African Americans and people of color.” Among California’s evangelical establishment, not everyone was ready to risk returning. The Rev. Rick Warren, whose Orange County-based Saddleback Church serves some 30,000 members at 20 locations, told congregants in an emailed video message this week that “Saddleback is going to be patient and wait for better conditions before resuming our large public gatherings.” On this Sunday, however, even the online prayers resonated. “What a shame it would be,” the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II of the North Carolina-based civil rights group Repairers of the Breach said in his streamed sermon, “if this nation could watch a policeman murder another human being and then pose like a hunter with his prey while his colleagues looked on — and there not be protests, there not be anger, there not be tears, there not be a diversity of people willing to say this is not right.” “Hear me, America,” Barber added. “The lethal violence of these racist officers and others is only one manifestation of the systemic racism that is choking the life out of the American democracy.” For many, what Americans do next matters much more than their ability to sit together in person in full church pews. “I’ve talked with lots of black friends and pastors who are altering between rage and tears all the time,” said the Rev. Dr. Terri Hord Owens, who leads the Christian Church, also known as the Disciples of Christ, which has some 3,000 congregations in the U.S. “The exhaustion that you feel as a black person in the United States is overwhelming and continues,” she said. “No matter what we say, no matter what we even do, this stuff keeps happening.” Owens is the first African American (and second woman) to lead a denomination whose membership is about 80% white. She said her mission now, as black churches mobilize, was to make sure that white churches joined them. Her church, like other mainline Protestant denominations, has taken progressive stances on social justice causes. But she said their efforts had to venture beyond academic discussions about racial inequality and institutional change.",0.0

An amazing launch of the first manned rocket in years from Cape Canaveral comes in fourth place in terms of importance to Americans. The economic disaster created by the coronavirus competes with the virus itself for second place as Americans struggle with the conflict: Is our economy more important than our health? Intelligence tells us that our health is more important. But many people having been cooped up in quarantine for the last four to eight weeks. Americans are an active, energetic people. The quarantine created a tinderbox of people anxious to get out and feel like they are living again. We found out this last week that Americans, true to character, really put politics in first priority, more important than health, economy or space flight, especially when protesting a televised injustice of racial police violence in Minnesota. Utah is fortunate to have Salt Lake City and County police leaders smart enough to use a brilliant strategy of peacefully allowing protesters to protest as they wanted Saturday while moving the crowd to eventually go home. The protesters who stayed to the end were arrested peacefully. There were 41 arrests. Some protesters were injured, several police officers were injured. Mayor Erin Mendenhall is initiating a review of all police actions. But, importantly, there were no deaths. It was an instance of no police brutality, of which all Utahns can be proud. As I watched the whole drama on television, it struck me that the basic character of Utahns is one of peace and compassion. Being the home of a major religion has had a good effect on our population. Having patted the police on the back and complimented Utah character, it is still important to take seriously what protesters were all about. As statistics pile up, we find African Americans and Latinos often at the bottom of the economic ladder and disproportionately filling our jails and prisons. It is easy for some of our leaders to blame the violence on anarchists, people from out of state and extremists. But this is just a ruse to allow us to not feel responsible for our own racism. There is a strong current of racism that seems to be built into white Americans. The history of slavery in America has long tentacles. The one fellow who wanted to protest the protest Saturday in Salt Lake can only be judged as foolish for bringing a bow and arrow and pointing it at some of the protesters. Protestors jumped him, beating him up. They then flipped his car over and set it on fire. Those who are white nationalists fail to understand one crucial fact. White people own and run most of the big businesses in America and hold many of the political offices. White people already are the privileged race in America. If this were a race, the white people have already won it. This makes the white nationalist movement absurd. The deeper problem is that there is much poverty among whites who for one reason or another feel left out of the bounty of being an American. This is a very real problem and fuels President Trump’s base. What kept being repeated on television Saturday was that the race problem in America can only be solved by changing America’s culture. As life has moved from the race and environmental movements of the 1960s to the acceptance of gay marriage and the anti-gun movements of teenagers (who try not to be shot while attending school) of the 2020s, considerable social and cultural progress has been made. Article continues below The undercurrent of racism that we all have must constantly be fought against. White people (of which I am one) must constantly go out of our way to treat others of all races with grace and love (as Christ commands) and civility and kindness (which democracy demands). Changing our culture to eliminate racism means changing our hearts. But it also means being conscious and self-aware of our thoughts, feelings and actions as we interact with other people every day. American values are built around freedom and equality. As we live, we must constantly think about treating others as equals and what that means. Gary Leimback",0.0
1623571737,2020-06-02 09:08:53,Paul Krugman: Trump takes us to the brink,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/paul-krugman-trump-takes/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Last fall Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis police union, appeared at a Trump rally, where he thanked the president for ending Barack Obama’s “oppression of police” and letting cops “put the handcuffs on criminals instead of us.” The events of the past week, in which the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody led to demonstrations against police brutality, and these demonstrations were met by more police brutality — including unprecedented violence against the news media — have made it clear what Kroll meant by taking the handcuffs off. And Donald Trump, far from trying to calm the nation, is pouring gasoline on the fire; he seems very close to trying to incite a civil war. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that America as we know it is on the brink. How did we get here? The core story of U.S. politics over the past four decades is that wealthy elites weaponized white racism to gain political power, which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already wealthy at workers’ expense. Until Trump’s rise it was possible — barely — for people to deny this reality with a straight face. At this point, however, it requires willful blindness not to see what’s going on. I still see occasional news reports that describe Trump as a “populist.” But Trump’s economic policies have been the opposite of populist: They have been relentlessly plutocratic, centered largely on a successful effort to ram through huge tax cuts for corporations and the rich, and a so far unsuccessful attempt to take health insurance away from poor and working-class families. Nor have Trump’s trade wars brought back the good jobs of yore. Even before the coronavirus plunged us into depression, Trump had failed to deliver major employment growth in coal mining or manufacturing. And farmers, who supported Trump by large margins in 2016, have suffered huge losses thanks to his trade wars. So what has Trump really offered to the white working class that makes up most of his base? Basically, he has provided affirmation and cover for racial hostility. And nowhere is this clearer than in his relationship with the police. If economic self-interest were the only thing driving political orientation, you would expect police officers to favor Democrats. They are, after all, unionized public-sector employees — and Republicans are both anti-union and anti-government. They don’t make enough money to benefit much from the Trump tax cut. Their jobs will be very much at risk if revenue-starved state and local governments are forced to make drastic spending cuts — and Trump’s allies in the Senate are blocking the aid that might avert such cuts. Article continues below Indeed, political contributions by public-sector unions overwhelmingly favor Democrats. And while many firefighters voted for Trump in 2016, the largest firefighters’ union has endorsed Joe Biden. But many police officers and their unions remain staunch Trump supporters, and they have been pretty clear about why: They feel that Trump will back them even, or perhaps especially, if they engage in abusive behavior toward racial minorities. Just to be clear, many and probably most police officers have behaved well over the past week. In fact, in some cities the police have shown solidarity with protesters, joining marches or taking a knee. But Trump clearly sides with those who reject any notion that police officers — or any other authority figures — should be held accountable for abusive behavior. Remember, he’s used his authority to pardon members of the U.S. military who were accused or convicted by their own services of committing war crimes. In a call with governors on Monday, he showed no sign of recognizing either that there might be some justification for widespread protests or that he should play some role in unifying the nation. Instead, he told the governors that all the violence was coming from the “radical left,” and he insisted that governors must get tougher: “You have to dominate or you’ll look like a bunch of jerks; you have to arrest and try people.” Trump — who retreated to an underground bunker when protesters began demonstrating in front of the White House — also told the governors that “most of you are weak.” It was a terrifying performance. Republicans have, as I said, spent decades exploiting racial hostility to win elections despite a policy agenda that hurts workers. But Trump is now pushing that cynical strategy toward a kind of apotheosis. On one side, he’s effectively inciting violence by his supporters. On the other, he’s very close to calling for a military response to social protest. And at this point, nobody expects any significant pushback from other Republicans. Now, I don’t think Trump will actually succeed in provoking a race war in the near future, even though he’s clearly itching for an excuse to use force. But the months ahead are still likely to be very, very ugly. After all, if Trump is encouraging violence and talking about military solutions to overwhelmingly peaceful protests, what will he and his supporters do if he looks likely to lose November’s election?

1623571734,2020-06-02 09:09:24,Jennifer Senior: What Trump and toxic cops have in common,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/jennifer-senior-what/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"In his first Inaugural Address, and hopefully his last, Donald Trump talked about American carnage. He got it last week. What we couldn’t have known in January 2017 is that he wasn’t here to save us from this carnage, but to perpetuate it; that incitement wasn’t just a feature of his campaign, but of his governance. When historians look back at the Trump era, they may very well say his presidency was encapsulated by this moment, when a sadistic cop knelt on the neck of an African American man in plain view for almost 9 minutes and the streets exploded in rage. Derek Chauvin was by no means the first cop to gratuitously brutalize and lynch an African American. But he embodied something essential about Trumpism: It’s us versus them. That’s the poison ethos at the heart of police brutality, and it’s the septic core of our 45th president’s philosophy. Neither a toxic cop nor Donald Trump sees himself as a servant of all the people they’ve sworn to protect. They are solely servants of their own. Everyone else is the enemy. From the beginning, the police have received a lot of perverse messages from Trump, encouraging them to embrace the bitter angels of their nature. Three summers ago, he gave a speech on Long Island, disparaging officers who cradled the heads of suspects as they tucked them into their squad cars: “You can take the hand away, OK?” (A bank of cops, seated behind him, started to laugh and cheer.) One of Trump’s most revealing tweets since the rioting began was a boast about the prowess of the Secret Service — and to threaten to sic “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons” on the crowds outside the White House if things intensified. He’s Bull Connor with a comb-over. Or Walter E. Headley, Miami’s former police chief, who in 1967 said, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase that reappeared in a Trump tweet Friday. And this is the point, is it not? Trump, who made his political bones by peddling apocrypha about our first African American president’s country of origin, thrives on racial divisions. Us-them. Conflict zones are his comfort zone, perfect for firing up his base. But the pressures of this historic moment proved to be too much. We can’t see the African Americans who are dying in disproportionate numbers inside our hospitals, but we can see George Floyd, an African American, cruelly singled out for asphyxiation in the street. His death in police custody is a potent symbol of the obscene inequality and racial hostility of this moment, with the police officer as Trump’s smirking and pitiless proxy. African Americans — and many whites, too — were so enraged that they poured out into the streets to protest, even in the midst of a pandemic, even though African Americans are most at risk in this pandemic. A month from now, it’s quite likely many will end up in hospitals, once again in disproportionate numbers. It’s too awful to contemplate. And once again, there’s a leadership vacuum in response to the chaos, just as there is with COVID-19. It’s every state for itself, with Trump trolling the most liberal leaders for their supposed failures to contain the unrest. How these protests devolved into violence across the country will be the subject of analysis for years to come. For now, what has riveted me is that somehow, in spite of the dystopian horror unfolding in front of us, in spite of execrable responses from some of the largest police forces in the country (including New York City’s), we’re nonetheless hearing talk of America as a perfectible place — of the arc still bending. It’s been more than three years since we’ve heard that tune. Yet there was Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, issuing a wee-hours statement that asked Americans not to ignore their pain, but to use it “to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity.” There was Killer Mike, the rapper from Atlanta, reminding his fellow citizens, “Atlanta’s not perfect, but we’re a lot better than we ever were, and a lot better than cities are.” Conservatives will focus on the pleas for law and order in their messages. But what I hear is a repudiation of Trumpian nihilism — a rejection of the tyranny of the perpetual “anxious present” that Masha Gessen describes in her forthcoming book “Surviving Autocracy.” They’re instead speaking with what Gessen calls “moral ambition,” inviting fellow citizens to build a more expansive country, rather than an us-versus-them one. Their messages weren’t, “Don’t destroy your community,” so much as, “There’s a still community left for you to join. Come and make it better.” Article continues below And so, along with terrifying imagery of fire and fury, we also saw images over the weekend of police officers and protesters marching together. The bonds were sometimes fragile, only to later disappear. But they happened. In Flint, Michigan. In Camden, New Jersey. In Coral Gables, Florida. In Santa Clara, California. In Ferguson, Missouri. In Kansas City, Missouri, where two cops, one white, held aloft a sign saying “End Police Brutality.” Or listen to the chief of police in Atlanta, Erika Shields, tell an anxious protester, “I hear you.” When Trump met with those who’d lost loved ones in the Parkland shooting, he needed an empathy cheat sheet that contained those very words; it was item No. 5. For her, they simply spilled out, as naturally as rain. (The New York Times) Jennifer Senior",0.0

Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities' actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president's heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Article continues below Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won't either."" But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division."" “I won't fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. ""I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.”",0.0

The Utah Jazz are not playing!” laughed Lee, famously a New York Knicks fan. “I’ve been very encouraged by the diversity of the protesters [nationwide].

The officer has since been charged with murder. In the short film, Lee juxtaposes Floyd’s death with that of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died in 2014 in a police chokehold, saying “I can’t breathe” — a phrase that has become a rallying cry for people protesting police brutality. In the film, Lee compares both real-life deaths with a fictional one: That of Radio Raheem, the character played by Bill Nunn in Lee’s 1989 movie “Do the Right Thing.” Raheem dies from a police chokehold, and his death sparks a riot in New York’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

More than half of the states have continued to allow religious gatherings, but many churches, synagogues and mosques, for safety’s sake, have chosen for months to make do with Zoom sermons and livestreams. Many stuck to remote services Sunday, but a significant number returned to public worship driven by a combination of pain, prayer and political expression. In Pennsylvania, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia resumed public Mass, but with churches restricted to half-occupancy, and every other pew empty. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints resumed some in-person services in Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Illinois, Utah and a number of other locations, but chose not to reopen temples in Nevada, Hawaii, Washington and other states. In California, at least a dozen evangelical churches made a coordinated return timed to Pentecost, a day of Christian jubilation that many regard as the church’s birthday. Some in that group were also seeking to pressure the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, into dropping a 100-person cap on church attendance and other rules enacted to curb the pandemic as the state’s coronavirus case count soared past 100,000, with 4,000 deaths. Several significant outbreaks started in churches. The state’s right to restrict church attendance during the crisis was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court late Friday. “Obviously we’re disappointed with the court’s ruling,” said Pastor Jim Domen, the founder of Church United, a group that had mobilized more than 1,500 pastors against California’s emergency restrictions. “But we report to a higher authority.” In Fresno, California, 350 congregants registered to attend a socially distanced service at Cornerstone Church, whose pastor earlier in the week had compared Mr. Newsom to Soviet leaders who had propped up the Berlin Wall. Article continues below But at the Water of Life Community Church in Fontana, where some 320 people had reserved tickets for a return on Sunday, Pastor Dan Carroll said on a livestream that the church was reconsidering its plan, and had decided “to try to comply and pray that he changes his mind in the next two weeks,” referring to Mr. Newsom. The sanctuary did open, but only about 100 people per service were allowed to enter. In Sacramento, Rodriguez and his members sang mostly without masks, in violation of state directives, but turned away some worshippers, trying to keep the crowd under 100. His point, he said, was not to criticize the governor, but to stand with his church. Robert H. Tyler, the lawyer representing the churches and pastors who signed the petition, cited growing rates of anxiety and depression, as well as the national unrest, as a justification for not complying with the Supreme Court decision. “Let’s give an outlet for people to meet in churches as an alternative to shutting down freeways and burning down buildings,” the statement said. In Sacramento, still raw from the 2018 police killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed young black man, the return to worship was set against multiple social flashpoints. Rodriguez said New Season had been planning to return from quarantine Sunday for several weeks. His motives were not as political as those of some ministers, he said — he delivered one of the prayers at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, but likes to say that his parishioners “worship the lamb, not the elephant or the donkey.” But he also disapproved of Newsom’s church guidelines, saying the cap on attendance was punitive for a 1,000-seat church like his. Also punitive, he said, was the state’s ban on church singing, a precaution against the airborne spread of the virus. (Max Whittaker | The New York Times) Worshippers during service at the New Season church in Sacramento, Calif., May 31, 2020. More than half of the states have continued to allow religious gatherings, but many churches, synagogues and mosques, for safetyÕs sake, have chosen for months to make do with Zoom sermons and livestreams, but many stuck to remote services on Sunday, but a significant number returned to public worship driven by a combination of pain, prayer and political expression. Then came the national fury at Floyd’s death. On the day before New Season’s service, nearly 1,000 demonstrators wielding Black Lives Matter signs converged on California’s state Capitol. As night fell, crowds swarmed the freeways and the Sacramento Kings’ glistening sports arena, defacing a landmark sculpture by artist Jeff Koons and looting nearby department stores. The pain was especially sharp at New Season, where the congregation is 40% black, 40% white and 20% Hispanic. Patricia Littlejohn, a church volunteer, said she had sought to tune out the violence, but that it had evoked painful memories of Clark’s shooting. Coming on top of the pandemic, which cost her job at a health club, she said the unrest left her feeling isolated. Gesturing to her fellow congregants, who were trying not to hug even as other volunteers entreated them to keep 7 feet of space between them, Littlejohn smiled. “This,” she said, “means everything.” In the front row, Mercedes Ray, a member of the church board, said the explosion of violence compelled churches to act. “What has happened out there is that people feel backed into a corner. They feel they’re not being heard and that nothing has been done.” That concern echoed with particular force among African American churchgoers, at the epicenter both of the fury over Floyd’s death and of the toll of the coronavirus. Out of caution, many African American churches held services with pastors preaching to empty sanctuaries and virtual congregations — even on a day when they would have wanted to be together most. “I think the church has to help make sure it is a wake-up call,” said the Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the senior pastor at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, New York, who kept his parish online Sunday. “The church has had to be a safety net for a society that has ignored the community,” he said. “It’s like you pull back the covers and saw all the years of inequity and, to some degree, racist disregard for African Americans and people of color.” Among California’s evangelical establishment, not everyone was ready to risk returning. The Rev. Rick Warren, whose Orange County-based Saddleback Church serves some 30,000 members at 20 locations, told congregants in an emailed video message this week that “Saddleback is going to be patient and wait for better conditions before resuming our large public gatherings.” On this Sunday, however, even the online prayers resonated. “What a shame it would be,” the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II of the North Carolina-based civil rights group Repairers of the Breach said in his streamed sermon, “if this nation could watch a policeman murder another human being and then pose like a hunter with his prey while his colleagues looked on — and there not be protests, there not be anger, there not be tears, there not be a diversity of people willing to say this is not right.” “Hear me, America,” Barber added. “The lethal violence of these racist officers and others is only one manifestation of the systemic racism that is choking the life out of the American democracy.” For many, what Americans do next matters much more than their ability to sit together in person in full church pews. “I’ve talked with lots of black friends and pastors who are altering between rage and tears all the time,” said the Rev. Dr. Terri Hord Owens, who leads the Christian Church, also known as the Disciples of Christ, which has some 3,000 congregations in the U.S. “The exhaustion that you feel as a black person in the United States is overwhelming and continues,” she said. “No matter what we say, no matter what we even do, this stuff keeps happening.” Owens is the first African American (and second woman) to lead a denomination whose membership is about 80% white. She said her mission now, as black churches mobilize, was to make sure that white churches joined them. Her church, like other mainline Protestant denominations, has taken progressive stances on social justice causes. But she said their efforts had to venture beyond academic discussions about racial inequality and institutional change.",0.0

SALT LAKE CITY – The rivals for the Democratic nomination to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop in Congress describe themselves as opposing progressive and moderate candidates, but they were of one mind about the urban unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd. During a June 1 broadcast sponsored by the Utah Debate Commission, Darren Parry of Logan said the sometimes-violent nationwide protests were the product of frustration because “people of color have not had a seat at the table. As a Native American leader, I understand that and it’s disheartening.” “We need to take the message from these protests that there is ‘over-policing’ happening to black and brown bodies here in America,” added Jamie Cheek of Ogden. “’Black Lives Matter’ is more than a hashtag; it’s a reality that we have to recognize.” George Floyd was an African-American who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. The arresting officer in the case, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with homicide. Graphic cellphone footage of Floyd’s death has sparked outrage across the county, including rioting over the past weekend in Salt Lake City and a peaceful protest in Ogden. The comments by Cheek and Parry during the debate echoed the rhetoric of many Democratic figures in recent days. Parry quoted the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he said: “Riots are the voice of the unheard.” For her part, Cheek referred to the incidents of civil unrest as “conversations” between protesters and authorities. “We need to make sure that we pay attention to these ‘conversations’ and give a voice to people who want to speak about these issues,” she argued. “These events have shown us that when police officers accept the message that is being sent to them and look for a solution rather than the end point of an arrest or putting someone into a police car, we have much better interactions in the long term.” Cheek said that she attended the recent protest held by Black Lives Matter activists in Ogden. “It was beautiful,” she recalled. “We had more than 2,000 people attend and the Ogden Police Department … was there to ensure that the people had the right to peacefully protest. That’s how it should work. People should be able to come together and have these ‘conversations’ and show what matters to our communities.” Both Democrats emphasized that police officers nationwide need to be more enlightened in their dealings with people of color. Parry said that police officers should focus on reducing confrontation in dangerous situations. “There needs to be comprehensive changes to the way that we train police officers,” Cheek agreed. “Far too often our officers are trapped in circumstances where they have to escalate a situation rather than deescalating it. “That’s the message that I want to take to Washington.”",0.0

At least four police officers in St. Louis received gunshot wounds and a man in Las Vegas was killed during mass demonstrations. Officials said a Las Vegas officer is also on life support with critical injuries. Activists nationwide defied curfews in some of the larger cities late Monday and early Tuesday, just hours after President Donald Trump threatened in a national address to send the U.S. military into cities that don’t control the violent demonstrations. “If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said. Tuesday, he said tensions were calming in and around Washington, D.C. “D.C. had no problems last night,” he tweeted. “Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great.” Trump also called on his hometown of New York City to call up the National Guard for help. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,” he tweeted. “Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!” Trump also criticized New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for not activating the National Guard. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio extended a curfew of 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. for the rest of this week after a night of looting and violence during which police officers were targeted. The New York City Police Department arrested more than 700 protesters overnight. Looters damaged the flagship Macy’s department store in midtown Manhattan, emptied a Nike store and broke storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Violence, fires and looting spread into the Bronx, where police said an officer was targeted in a hit-and-run attack. “That is wholly unacceptable and does not represent the people of this city,” de Blasio said. “Anyone who attacks a police officer attacks all of us.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized de Blasio on Tuesday morning for not deploying enough police officers to handle the outbreaks of violence. “I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I believe he underestimates the duration of the problem, and I don’t think they’ve used enough police to address the situation,” the governor said. Cuomo said the mayor didn’t accept his offer to send the National Guard to the state’s largest city. The governor threatened to override the mayor. “Can you displace a mayor? Yes. A mayor can be removed. It has not happened. I can’t find a precedent. But theoretically it is legally possible,” Cuomo said. “It is a bizarre thing to try to do in this situation. I think it would make a bad situation worse. Also, I don’t think it’s necessary, because I believe the NYPD can do this, because the NYPD has done this. Two autopsies issued Monday agreed that Floyd’s death was a homicide, but they differed on the precise cause. An independent autopsy said he died from mechanical asphyxiation, while the county coroner said Floyd died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” The county’s autopsy said Floyd also had “other significant conditions” including arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and “recent” methamphetamine use. Tuesday, Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington. They observed a moment of remembrance near the statue of Saint John Paul II and visited the Luminous Mysteries Chapel, the John Paul II blood relic and the Madonna icon. The Trumps also laid a wreath at the site before departing. Trump later plans to sign an executive order for religious freedom. Floyd’s funeral is scheduled for June 9 in his hometown of Houston. Monday, Terrence Floyd visited the site of his brother’s death in Minneapolis and urged for calm amid growing national unrest. “I know he would not want you all to be doing this,” he said, asking angry demonstrators to get out and vote for change and demand justice peacefully. “If I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community — then what are y’all doing?” he added. “That’s not going to bring my brother back.” In Denver, authorities charged a 37-year-old man with striking three police officers and a civilian during a hit-and-run late incident over the weekend. Demonstrations in Denver were mostly peaceful Monday night as thousands gathered at the State Capitol and knelt to honor Floyd. Tuesday, the European Union’s top diplomat called Floyd’s death an “abuse of power.” EU High Representative Josep Borrell told reporters that such abuses must be denounced and condemned. “We here in Europe, like the people of the United States, are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd, and I think that all societies must remain vigilant against excessive use of force and ensure that all such incidents are addressed swiftly effectively and in full respect of the rule of law and human rights,” Borrell said. The EU, he added, supports “the right to peaceful protest and we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” U.S. protests death of George Floyd An American flag with a portrait of George Floyd is seen during a protest outside the Federal Building in Los Angeles on June 1.

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

Police also shared photos of an armored vehicle with its windows shattered. The demonstration, organized over social media by the group Party for Socialism and Liberation, began about 6 p.m., when police began receiving reports of large crowds gathering downtown near the site of Saturday’s upheaval. As the number of demonstrators began to swell, police moved quickly to stay ahead of the crowds, blocking streets and pedestrian traffic for several square blocks. While the majority of protesters massed near the city’s Public Safety Building, the City Library and Washington Square, police paid close attention to smaller groups of people who left the main protest and made their way into the downtown area. At 8 p.m. police informed the crowds the city’s newly imposed curfew was in effect. They were told to disband or risk arrest and most appeared to comply. Hundreds of others, however, made their way to the perimeter of the Utah statehouse where they were met by dozens of baton-wielding UHP officers. A military chopper circled overhead. When the crowd refused to disperse, officers moved on them, knocking demonstrators to the ground. The seemingly stunned protesters moved back down State Street and marched into downtown, where approximately 200 soon found themselves surrounded by police near South Temple and State Street. After a few tense moments, organizers asked if the crowd could simply go home and police agreed. Several protesters decided to defy the curfew order and were taken into custody without incident. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall announced a new curfew for all of Salt Lake City beginning Monday, June 1, extending through Monday, June 8, it was announced soon before the protest began. The curfew will begin each evening at 8 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. each morning, said a news release from the Mayor’s Office. During the curfew, people are asked to stay off of public streets and sidewalks and out of parks and other public spaces, with some exceptions. “The decision to continue a curfew here in Salt Lake City was not made lightly,” Mendenhall said. “But as we’ve seen throughout the country, the valid frustration many people feel continues to exhibit itself beyond the bounds of peaceful discourse. While Salt Lake City respects and understands the anger people legitimately feel, and welcomes the presence of peaceful protests, the safety of our city, our public safety officers, and our residents must come first.” SLC Police Chief Mike Brown added: “It is with a heavy heart that we enact another curfew. I hope and pray it is the last, and that we can do the hard work of building a better city together.” The mayor’s decision to establish the new curfew was arrived at in consultation with Brown and Governor Gary Herbert. “The city prides itself on protecting the right of people to peaceably assemble and protest as one of the pillars of democracy,” the news release said. “All peaceful gatherings and protests are welcomed during non-curfew hours but attendees are urged to gather in small groups and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” During the hours of curfew, people may not be on a public street or in any public place with the following exceptions: All law enforcement, fire paramedics or other medical personnel, Utah National Guard, as well as any other emergency response personnel authorized by Salt Lake City, and credentialed members of the media. Individuals traveling directly to and from work; attending religious services; obtaining food; caring for a family member, friend or animal; traveling directly to and from the Salt Lake City International Airport; patronizing private businesses including but not limited to merchants and restaurants; seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or experiencing homelessness. Any person to whom permission by authorized Salt Lake City officials is specifically granted. Herbert has also issued an Executive Order early Monday evening declaring a State of Emergency due to civil unrest. This order will temporarily close the State Capitol complex to the public. The order is effective immediately, and the capitol campus will remain closed until Saturday, June 6 at 11:59 p.m. Official state business will continue at the Capitol building throughout the closure. The building has been closed to the public since March 14 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. View the full Executive Order here.

""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

1623647964,2020-06-02 17:07:42,GOP criticism muted on Trump’s handling of protests,https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2020/6/2/21278549/gop-republican-utah-senator-mitt-romney-president-donald-trump-protests-riots-washington-dc,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"WASHINGTON — A handful of GOP senators spoke out Tuesday against President Donald Trump, criticizing his visit to a church after police removed peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House. The remarks came even as most Republicans continued to avoid any disapproval of the president. In a memorable scene captured live on television, police cleared Lafayette Park so Trump could walk to nearby St. John’s Church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Some Republicans joined in the criticism on Tuesday. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property ... but there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,’’ said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump’s visit to the church was unhelpful and not something Scott would have done. “Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,” Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was “painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he’s attended only once.’’ While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, “I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,’’ she said. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called Trump’s walk to the church “confrontational” and said it “distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests and lawful assembly.’’ That message “was drowned out by an awkward photo op,’’ Lankford said. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide “should be lowering the temperature” over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd’s death. “Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,’’ Sasse said, adding that “riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.’’ Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by the GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump’s demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump’s impeachment in February. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that “as a general matter, I always think it’s a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.’’ Still, Thune said views of Trump’s actions were “going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.’’ Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely “thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that’s just where we are, sadly.” On Trump’s threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump “arguably” has the authority to use military force, “so far he hasn’t done it,’’ Cornyn said. “Hopefully, he won’t do it. It won’t be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.” Thune said he would “prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that “Democrats’ obsession with condemning President Trump” was blinding them to more urgent priorities, such as “ending the riots or advancing racial justice.’’ McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd’s death. “The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,’’ McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a “historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don’t have a right to burn a church.’’ Collins, who is considered one of the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents, said that at a time when the president “ought to be trying to calm the nation,″ Trump did not do that. __ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick and Padmananda Rama contributed to this story.",0.0
1623647959,2020-06-02 17:10:49,President Trump calls for support for international religious freedom in new executive order,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/6/2/21278450/donald-trump-religious-freedom-executive-order-christian-persecution-sam-brownback-state-department,en,False,,20270,Deseret News,http://www.deseretnews.com,"SALT LAKE CITY — President Donald Trump reiterated his support for international religious freedom Tuesday in an executive order aimed at increasing the government’s outreach to persecuted people of faith around the world. The order calls on the secretary of state and other top officials to prioritize religious freedom in their work and requests that at least $50 million in foreign assistance funds be earmarked each year for programs that serve and protect faith communities. It also instructs government leaders to offer trainings on religion to American diplomats working overseas and to empower them to bring up international religious freedom issues when meeting with foreign officials. “Religious freedom for all people worldwide is a foreign policy priority of the United States, and the United States will respect and vigorously promote this freedom,” Trump wrote. The order’s release was timed to coincide with the president’s visit to a shrine honoring Pope John Paul II, who was widely celebrated for his work on behalf of persecuted people of faith. However, the event was overshadowed by Trump’s controversial Monday night appearance in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which was only possible because police tear gassed protesters gathered in front of the White House. “Saint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings,” said Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory in a statement provided to The Washington Post. “He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate” protesters. The new executive order was in the works before this week’s protest-related drama. It’s the latest in a series of actions related to international religious freedom taken by the Trump administration. The president has hosted two high-profile gatherings at the State Department on the subject and, last fall, he spoke about the need to protect religious communities during an appearance at the United Nations. “Regrettably, the religious freedom enjoyed by American citizens is rare in the world,” he said during the UN event. Although Trump is far from the first president to champion religious freedom both at home and abroad, his administration has gone above and beyond typical procedures, according to experts on religious persecution. Before the administration’s recent gatherings on religious freedom at the State Department, it was almost unheard of to have high-level officials come together to discuss the needs of people of faith, said Kristina Arriaga, a former commissioner of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, to the Deseret News last year. “Normally when you have international events associated with religious freedom, they’re (attended by) low people in the diplomatic echelon,” she said. Leaders in the White House, State Department and other agencies are committed to doing everything they can on behalf of people of faith, said Sam Brownback, who serves as U.S. ambassador-at-large on international religious freedom, to the Deseret News last year. “You had to get an administration that wanted to really push (religious freedom) and that’s what this one does and is,” he said. But some religious and political leaders have a very different view on the Trump administration’s work. Over the past few years, the president has been repeatedly criticized for focusing more on the needs of Christians than other persecuted religious groups. “Far from protecting religious freedom, he’s undermining it at every turn,” said Maggie Garrett, the vice president for public policy for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, to the Deseret News earlier this year. Trump seems unconcerned with these criticisms and continues to regularly highlight his efforts to end religious persecution. “As president, protecting religious freedom is one of my highest priorities and always has been,” he said during his appearance at the United Nations last fall.",0.0
1623651536,2020-06-02 16:25:00,Pelosi Asks Black Caucus To Come Up With Police Reforms Following Protests,https://www.kuer.org/post/pelosi-asks-black-caucus-come-police-reforms-following-protests,en,False,,268355,kuer.org,http://kuer.org/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response to the protests that have swept the country following the death of George Floyd. House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

1623658312,2020-06-02 17:40:08,Salt Lake City residents voice frustrations after being slapped with weeklong curfew amid protests,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/06/02/salt-lake-city-residents/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"The mayor says it’s to protect public safety, but Salt Lake City residents say the current curfew feels more like punishment. Mayor Erin Mendenhall decided Monday to require people to stay home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. each day until June 8. The move came after protests over racial injustice became violent and destructive Saturday in downtown Salt Lake City. But numerous residents call the curfew a heavy-handed and hypocritical response compared to lax enforcement of coronavirus restrictions. Others said it violated their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble and gave police a tool to target protesters. Some were left feeling confused or less safe. “The only thing the curfews are doing is giving the police a reason to arrest dissenters, and [it’s] doing nothing for the safety of our community,” said Katy Willis, a downtown business owner. “Absolutely no reason to make this more serious than the city’s reaction to COVID-19.” The current curfew order came just one hour before hundreds of people assembled for a second protest Monday afternoon. That gathering mostly remained peaceful, although many stayed out past 8 p.m. in violation of the mayor’s order. “It’s really ironic that the mayor would post public support for the protest, but at the same time the protest started, she imposed a weeklong lockdown,” said Moira Turner with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, an organizer of Monday’s protest. She expressed frustration that there was no police presence or any similar heavy-handed actions when a thousand people gathered downtown in April to protest pandemic closures. “They were open-carrying semiautomatic rifles,” Turner said. “We didn’t see the National Guard called out for them. We didn’t see a lockdown.” Former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson also pointed out the city’s differing responses to the gatherings, tweeting that the curfew was “another empty edict.” Obviously another empty edict. And why a curfew to shut down freedom of expression when you wouldn’t enforce your ban on public gatherings for the sake of public health when over 1,000 right-wing Covidiots gathered at C & C Bldg? Let people peacefully assemble without curfews! — Rocky Anderson (@RockyAnderson) June 2, 2020 Monday’s order was the second curfew imposed by Mendenhall in response to the protests. Article continues below The first lasted until 6 a.m. Monday and started Saturday evening during a rally organized by Utah Against Police Brutality that turned violent. Protesters flipped two vehicles, smashed windows and spray-painted buildings and other structures downtown and at the state Capitol. A man threatened the protesters with a hunting bow, videos show, and an officer pushed an elderly man to the ground. Connor Boyack, president of the Libertas Institute libertarian think tank, said elected officials are rightly concerned about public safety. Their response, however, should be “narrow and targeted,” he said. “We are concerned that this curfew goes too far, trying to justify its restrictions on the many based on the bad actions of a few."" John Mejia with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah said that the calm in the city since Saturday shows police have other tools to protect people and property. “The past several days have been relatively quiet,” Mejia said. “When it comes to First Amendment activities, our strong preference is that we give people the benefit of the doubt that they’re going to be peaceful.” When asked about litigation over the curfew, ACLU is “keeping options on the table,” Mejia said, but he noted that his organization has been in touch with city authorities and that he appreciates their willingness to listen to concerns. Curfew orders have been imposed in at least 34 other cities and for the entire state of Arizona in an effort to clamp down on protest riots, according to reporting by The Hill. Only a few places appear to have curfews that last as long as Salt Lake City’s, although orders in San Francisco and Chicago remain in place until further notice. “It seems like a very extreme reaction to some graffiti and property damage, which was insured or has already been cleaned up,"" said Salt Lake City resident Shelese Stoddard. ""There are many groups who want to protest peacefully and following social distancing guidelines as best they can and are now restricted from doing so.” Sugar House resident Kent Bonacki said the curfews further silence the voices of groups that feel disenfranchised by the police and institutional racism. “The mere fact that frequenting businesses is an explicit exemption to the curfew demonstrates how much of a farce it is,"" Bonacki said. “We can all go spend our money at our favorite stores, but we can’t organize and practice our First Amendment rights.” The curfew allows people to leave their homes to shop, work, worship, and take care of family members, friends and pets. It also doesn’t apply to public safety officers, members of the media or people experiencing homelessness. Still, city resident Estelle Hafen worries about “holes” she sees in the order and whether police will be able to tell the difference between a protester and someone who’s out at night for other reasons. “Are minorities going to be disproportionately affected because there’s a lack of clarity?” Hafen said. Katie Beacom works in the city and said she and her co-workers worry about getting pulled over when they leave work after 8 p.m. It adds to her concerns about working during a pandemic. “The most frustrating part of an enforced curfew is that the stay-home order in Utah was never enforced,” Beacom said. “There was nowhere near this level of scrutiny when it came to protecting public health.” Mayor and police respond In an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Mendenhall explained the curfew’s rationale. “Our city police department and state Department of Public Safety have been working in concert since Saturday. They’ve evaluated the national climate and local intelligence,” the mayor said. “We’ve determined and been encouraged by the state to put this in place and keep our city from taking a path that some other cities around the country are tragically on.” She acknowledged that Salt Lake City remains the epicenter of coronavirus cases in the state and said the city is working to protect public safety on both fronts — the pandemic and the protests. She also acknowledged that Monday’s gathering was largely peaceful. “We’re grateful for the peaceful protest last night. We hear you; we have been willing to work together from the beginning,” Mendenhall said. “I recognize peoples’ voices always need to be heard. We’re grateful Salt Lake City is a place where we can host that.” Even though many protesters stayed out past 8 p.m., Mendenhall said the curfew is still effective because it gives officers the legal authority to require people to go home. “Whether that happens at 8 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. is relative,” she said. “As we’ve seen across the country, there’s nothing good that happens in the middle of the night with protests that turn to riots.” At a Salt Lake County Council meeting Tuesday afternoon, Sheriff Rosie Rivera called George Floyd’s death as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck a “horrific tragedy” and said police should be held to account. “Unfortunately, 850,000 officers are paying the price, with several officers killed over the weekend nationwide. It’s tough. We’re in a bad situation right now,” Rivera said, her voice quaking. “Excuse me for being emotional. I see both sides of it. I’m a person of color and I’m a police officer.” Salt Lake City Police Detective Greg Wilking, a department spokesman, said Tuesday that no residents had been arrested Monday for violating curfew who weren’t part of a protest. And while he urged people to follow the city’s new guidelines, he said they likely won’t be picked up by police for something like taking a walk in the park after 8 p.m. “We don’t have the time, the energy or the bandwidth to go out and do that, nor would that be a responsible thing to do,” he said, noting that arrests are “our last resort. Even with the protesters, we don’t want to do it.” Instead, Wilking said, officers have been working to educate people who are out after curfew and may not be aware of the guidelines. — Tribune reporter Taylor Stevens contributed to this story.

If I was the cop, you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” Another tweet @ProfSenjo referred to protesters vandalizing the CNN building in Atlanta: “Nothing about this makes me happy but there’s this tiny sense of rightness in the burning of the CNN headquarters.” Still another addressed a widely viewed video of New York Police Department vehicles that plowed into a crowd of protesters. The tweet said: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” The Change.org petition posted Sunday says in part: “His tweets go against freedom of speech and diversity of opinion as he is pushing for violence against press, as well as people of color. Criminal justice students at Weber deserve better. Students of color at Weber deserve better. This is a call for Weber State University to do better and be better by firing Scott Senjo.” It notes, “Weber State University has a long-standing tradition of embracing freedom of speech and diversity of opinion. Professor Senjo’s tweets do not represent these values.” When asked for comment, Senjo wrote in an email that he was responsible for the tweets. “But I don’t stand by them and will have to suffer the consequences of my recklessness,” he said. “I made those tweets in the sordid atmosphere of Twitter knife fights where sarcastic put downs and tasteless humor are often the norm. I failed to respect my role as a college professor in the hyper-emotional atmosphere of the recent police brutality protests. I apologize for my Twitter contributions. In the aggregate, they reflect a great deal of ugliness.” Senjo is a tenured professor who has taught at Weber State University for 20 years. He holds a number of advanced degrees, including a doctorate from Florida Atlantic University, a law degree and master’s degree in public policy and administration from the University of Utah and an undergraduate degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. A statement on the university’s website says the matter is under investigation. WSU spokeswoman Allison Barlow Hess said Tuesday that the university is aware of the petition and officials “are hearing many comments from all perspectives, through social media, email and phone. Most of them express anger at the Twitter posts. The posts were abhorrent and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University and our work to create an inclusive and welcoming environment.” A statement by Weber State University President Brad Mortensen said in part that the university stands “with peaceful protesters in Ogden and across the globe and call for change: an end to racism, an end to oppression and intolerance, an end to violence. I call upon all members of our campus community to join me in pursuing a calm, respectful, yet urgent path. “The tragic death of George Floyd ignited anger, outrage and fear. The resulting tensions, protests and riots expedite our need to do more and be better about erasing the inequities in our society — not just in this moment but in all moments. That means working on ourselves and our communities.” It continues: “We will continue to promote civic engagement and dialogue among all of our students, I encourage us all to begin by self-reflecting, reading and participating in thoughtful dialogues to examine our own attitudes and actions. Then, let us build within our communities the example through which our society can eliminate the larger systemic and institutionalized problems around race and identity. “At Weber State, we continue to seek and support transformation to a better place for all.” An earlier statement by the university’s notes WSU does not condone violence or threats of violence under any circumstance. “The comments made by our faculty member are hurtful and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University and our work to create an inclusive and welcoming environment. We join with our students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends who found these comments to be abhorrent. “We know these views make many of our students and members of our campus community feel isolated or unsupported. We will reach out to students, faculty, staff and others to provide resources. Students or community members who need support may contact WSU’s Assistant Vice President for Diversity Adrienne Andrews 801-626-7243 or adrienneandrews@weber.edu.”",0.0

1623663725,2020-06-02 17:40:08,Salt Lake City residents voice frustrations after being slapped with weeklong curfew amid protests,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/06/02/salt-lake-city-residents/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"The mayor says it’s to protect public safety, but Salt Lake City residents say the current curfew feels more like punishment. Mayor Erin Mendenhall decided Monday to require people to stay home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. each day until June 8. The move came after protests over racial injustice became violent and destructive Saturday in downtown Salt Lake City. But numerous residents call the curfew a heavy-handed and hypocritical response compared to lax enforcement of coronavirus restrictions. Others said it violated their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble and gave police a tool to target protesters. Some were left feeling confused or less safe. “The only thing the curfews are doing is giving the police a reason to arrest dissenters, and [it’s] doing nothing for the safety of our community,” said Katy Willis, a downtown business owner. “Absolutely no reason to make this more serious than the city’s reaction to COVID-19.” The current curfew order came just one hour before hundreds of people assembled for a second protest Monday afternoon. That gathering mostly remained peaceful, although many stayed out past 8 p.m. in violation of the mayor’s order. “It’s really ironic that the mayor would post public support for the protest, but at the same time the protest started, she imposed a weeklong lockdown,” said Moira Turner with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, an organizer of Monday’s protest. She expressed frustration that there was no police presence or any similar heavy-handed actions when a thousand people gathered downtown in April to protest pandemic closures. “They were open-carrying semiautomatic rifles,” Turner said. “We didn’t see the National Guard called out for them. We didn’t see a lockdown.” Former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson also pointed out the city’s differing responses to the gatherings, tweeting that the curfew was “another empty edict.” Obviously another empty edict. And why a curfew to shut down freedom of expression when you wouldn’t enforce your ban on public gatherings for the sake of public health when over 1,000 right-wing Covidiots gathered at C & C Bldg? Let people peacefully assemble without curfews! — Rocky Anderson (@RockyAnderson) June 2, 2020 Monday’s order was the second curfew imposed by Mendenhall in response to the protests. Article continues below The first lasted until 6 a.m. Monday and started Saturday evening during a rally organized by Utah Against Police Brutality that turned violent. Protesters flipped two vehicles, smashed windows and spray-painted buildings and other structures downtown and at the state Capitol. A man threatened the protesters with a hunting bow, videos show, and an officer pushed an elderly man to the ground. Connor Boyack, president of the Libertas Institute libertarian think tank, said elected officials are rightly concerned about public safety. Their response, however, should be “narrow and targeted,” he said. “We are concerned that this curfew goes too far, trying to justify its restrictions on the many based on the bad actions of a few."" John Mejia with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah said that the calm in the city since Saturday shows police have other tools to protect people and property. “The past several days have been relatively quiet,” Mejia said. “When it comes to First Amendment activities, our strong preference is that we give people the benefit of the doubt that they’re going to be peaceful.” When asked about litigation over the curfew, ACLU is “keeping options on the table,” Mejia said, but he noted that his organization has been in touch with city authorities and that he appreciates their willingness to listen to concerns. Curfew orders have been imposed in at least 34 other cities and for the entire state of Arizona in an effort to clamp down on protest riots, according to reporting by The Hill. Only a few places appear to have curfews that last as long as Salt Lake City’s, although orders in San Francisco and Chicago remain in place until further notice. “It seems like a very extreme reaction to some graffiti and property damage, which was insured or has already been cleaned up,"" said Salt Lake City resident Shelese Stoddard. ""There are many groups who want to protest peacefully and following social distancing guidelines as best they can and are now restricted from doing so.” Sugar House resident Kent Bonacki said the curfews further silence the voices of groups that feel disenfranchised by the police and institutional racism. “The mere fact that frequenting businesses is an explicit exemption to the curfew demonstrates how much of a farce it is,"" Bonacki said. “We can all go spend our money at our favorite stores, but we can’t organize and practice our First Amendment rights.” The curfew allows people to leave their homes to shop, work, worship, and take care of family members, friends and pets. It also doesn’t apply to public safety officers, members of the media or people experiencing homelessness. Still, city resident Estelle Hafen worries about “holes” she sees in the order and whether police will be able to tell the difference between a protester and someone who’s out at night for other reasons. “Are minorities going to be disproportionately affected because there’s a lack of clarity?” Hafen said. Katie Beacom works in the city and said she and her co-workers worry about getting pulled over when they leave work after 8 p.m. It adds to her concerns about working during a pandemic. “The most frustrating part of an enforced curfew is that the stay-home order in Utah was never enforced,” Beacom said. “There was nowhere near this level of scrutiny when it came to protecting public health.” Mayor and police respond In an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Mendenhall explained the curfew’s rationale. “Our city police department and state Department of Public Safety have been working in concert since Saturday. They’ve evaluated the national climate and local intelligence,” the mayor said. “We’ve determined and been encouraged by the state to put this in place and keep our city from taking a path that some other cities around the country are tragically on.” She acknowledged that Salt Lake City remains the epicenter of coronavirus cases in the state and said the city is working to protect public safety on both fronts — the pandemic and the protests. She also acknowledged that Monday’s gathering was largely peaceful. “We’re grateful for the peaceful protest last night. We hear you; we have been willing to work together from the beginning,” Mendenhall said. “I recognize peoples’ voices always need to be heard. We’re grateful Salt Lake City is a place where we can host that.” Even though many protesters stayed out past 8 p.m., Mendenhall said the curfew is still effective because it gives officers the legal authority to require people to go home. “Whether that happens at 8 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. is relative,” she said. “As we’ve seen across the country, there’s nothing good that happens in the middle of the night with protests that turn to riots.” At a Salt Lake County Council meeting Tuesday afternoon, Sheriff Rosie Rivera called George Floyd’s death as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck a “horrific tragedy” and said police should be held to account. “Unfortunately, 850,000 officers are paying the price, with several officers killed over the weekend nationwide. It’s tough. We’re in a bad situation right now,” Rivera said, her voice quaking. “Excuse me for being emotional. I see both sides of it. I’m a person of color and I’m a police officer.” Salt Lake City Police Detective Greg Wilking, a department spokesman, said Tuesday that no residents had been arrested Monday for violating curfew who weren’t part of a protest. And while he urged people to follow the city’s new guidelines, he said they likely won’t be picked up by police for something like taking a walk in the park after 8 p.m. “We don’t have the time, the energy or the bandwidth to go out and do that, nor would that be a responsible thing to do,” he said, noting that arrests are “our last resort. Even with the protesters, we don’t want to do it.” Instead, Wilking said, officers have been working to educate people who are out after curfew and may not be aware of the guidelines. — Tribune reporter Taylor Stevens contributed to this story.

Over the past few days, riots have been taking place in downtown Salt Lake City. As part of the governor debate, candidates discussed what they would do in this situation. Thomas Wright, the former Utah GOP Chairman, said as governor he would get involved with Peace Officer Standards and Training, POST, and direct the Commissioner of Public Safety on new and future officer curriculums. “They’ll be trained so that they're listening and learning and we're being compassionate with each other,"" explained Wright. ""And we can take action on racial inequality. And we can even discuss the course for current police officers. I know they want to be a part of the solution, and they should have an equal opportunity”. Lt. Governor Spencer Cox said that responding with strength to riots is important to allow peaceful protests. “We can allow the people space who are protesting lawfully so that we can work together, and we will work together. We're working with our multi multicultural commission. We're working with our Martin Luther King commission. We're actually we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow to talk about these very issues. But there is absolutely no place for chaos,"" said Cox. ""There is no place for destruction.” Former Speaker of the House Greg Hughes said there is nothing wrong with peaceful protests, but when they get violent, something needs to be done. “If you're going to go and go find quarantine issues that bring down the law, but you're not going to let these issues be handled,"" said Hughes. ""And you're going to let these writers go. That's a deal killer and we cannot let that happen to our country or our state” The final candidate to address the question, former Governor Jon Huntsman, believes that this the state can manage the protest situation on their own without the help of the federal government. “On Saturday, I saw something I've never seen in this state,"" explained Huntsman. ""I saw Blackhawk helicopters circling in the sky downtown. I saw Humvees at the intersections. I heard curfews that were being enforced by the state. I would say, I'm concerned about civil liberties. This is not what we see in the state of Utah, maybe others, but not here.” The primary election for governor will take place June 30, 2020.",0.0

Majorities of Americans across racial lines say white people are treated more fairly than black people by the police, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The dynamic has played out in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, which began in 2014 with the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by white, former Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson. (AP Photo/Julie Bennett, File) SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (ABC4 News) – When you woke up this morning and began to scroll through social media, you probably noticed a lot of people posting ‘blackout photos’ and have wondered what is going on. Related: Man with cane speaks out after being pushed down by officer in riot gear The #blackoutTuesday movement began within the music industry by music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang who wrote on a site that June 2 would be a day to pause all business to ‘intentionally disrupt the work week’ because ‘we can’t wait till Friday to make a change’. This comes as people continue to mourn the loss of George Floyd and continue to protest and call for change within communities around the country.

So what else are people doing on this #blackoutTuesday? Not posting on social media Posting only a blank black image on all social media platforms for solidarity Suspending all music streams and YouTube streams for the day Canceling/closing/suspending participation in all dance studios, classes and meetings Identifying ways to help their community Strengthening their knowledge on contemporary race relations and the history of black social, political and economic plight in the U.S. So far, people have typically just been posting the black photo to social media and solely using the #blackoutTuesday tag and avoiding using the #blacklivesmatter tag. Why? People are arguing that if you post a blank black photo with the #blacklivesmatter tag, you are clogging up critical channels of information and updates that are vital to the #blacklivesmatter movement. So, most posts you will find Tuesday will only include #blackoutTuesday although they are in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement.",0.0

1623675971,2020-06-02 18:00:06,Jamelle Bouie: You can’t be the ‘president of law and order’ if you thrive on chaos,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/jamelle-bouie-you-cant-be/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"Everything has hit at once. Everywhere there are scenes of a society at the breaking point: of angry protesters and destructive demonstrations; of police forces that have unleashed nearly unrestrained violence on those in the streets, in an apparent effort to prove the point of their most militant critics; of governors calling the National Guard to try to regain control of their cities. The sheer scale and reach of the unrest — the extent to which it seems to represent a crisis of legitimacy as much as a reaction to police violence — has invited comparisons to 1968, the year in which much of America was rocked by protests and riots of even greater scale and destruction. And as The New York Times reports, President Donald Trump’s advisers are among those making the comparison: Some in the president’s circle see the escalations as a political boon, much in the way Richard M. Nixon won the presidency on a law-and-order platform after the 1968 riots. One adviser to Mr. Trump, who insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, said images of widespread destruction could be helpful to the law-and-order message that Mr. Trump has projected since his 2016 campaign. The immediate reason to discount a political analogy between then and now — between Nixon and Trump — is that Trump isn’t a challenger to the incumbent president; he is the incumbent. And whereas Nixon’s “law and order” was a contrast with and rebuke to Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Party, a Trump attempt to play the hits and recapitulate that campaign would only be an attack on his own tenure. You can’t promise “law and order” when disorder is happening on your watch. There are other unavoidable problems with any attempt by Trump to adopt Nixon’s 1968 campaign for his own purposes. As former vice president to Dwight Eisenhower — who led the nation at a time when the white American majority felt culturally and economically secure — Nixon could credibly claim to represent stability in the face of chaos, a steady hand in an uncertain time. Trump can do no such thing. He built his entire political persona around discord and disruption. Having promised to throw the system into disarray, Trump could not then sell himself as an avatar of order and control. He can sell himself as an avatar of violence — as he did when he ordered federal law enforcement to attack peaceful protesters for the sake of a photo op, after promising to use military force against protesters — but there’s no evidence that most Americans want that kind of “leadership.” Nor could he present himself as a steadfast authority in the way that Nixon did throughout that campaign. In the face of unrest, Trump has all but abdicated leadership, retreating to a presidential bunker while he orders the nation’s governors to repress demonstrations. “You have to dominate or you’ll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,” Trump said in a Situation Room phone call with the governors. “It’s a movement, if you don’t put it down it will get worse and worse. The only time it’s successful is when you’re weak and most of you are weak.” When he did attempt to speak to the nation, through Twitter of course, it was to promise violent retribution against protesters. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he said, adding that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase first used in 1967 by Walter Headley, the chief of police in Miami, also in reference to stopping protests and civil unrest. A “law-and-order” campaign just isn’t available to Trump. If there is anyone who occupies a similar position to Nixon in this campaign, it’s Joe Biden, the vice president to a still-popular former president who is running as the candidate of normalcy and stability. The simple truth is that comparisons to 1968 should be made sparingly. Yes, we have mass civil unrest, but it’s impossible at this stage to say how it will play out in November and you can’t simply plot the circumstances of a half-century ago onto the present. There are too many differences. There is no Vietnam War or disintegrating Democratic coalition. Our unrest is happening against a backdrop of deprivation and deep inequality, not the relative prosperity of the late 1960s. And while Trump benefits from a devoted coalition, it remains a vocal minority, not a “silent majority.” Article continues below The protests are different too, encompassing a large, diverse cross-section of America. In turn, there appears to be greater sympathy for the protesters and their grievances, so much so that most public officials outside of the president and his closest allies have shown some understanding of the anger and discontent even as they oppose riots and disorder. All of this gets to a larger point. History can be incredibly useful for analyzing and understanding the present — that is, in fact, the aim of much of my writing. But we shouldn’t forget that our circumstances are not theirs, and our future cannot be divined from the events of the past. We simply do not know what comes next, nor can we predict the events that — as we have seen with the pandemic and the killing of George Floyd — can move an entire nation from one path to the other. As we try to understand the forces at work in this country, we should do so with profound humility about the limits of what we can know and what we can foresee. We should remember that the past, like the present, was contingent; that events that seem inevitable could have gone a different way; that those who lived through them were, like us, unable to see how things would unfold. We should be aware of the past — we should understand the processes that produced our world — but it shouldn’t be a substitute for thinking. We are not them, and now is not then. Jamelle Bouie",0.0

1623678633,2020-06-02 18:00:06,Jamelle Bouie: You can’t be the ‘president of law and order’ if you thrive on chaos,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/jamelle-bouie-you-cant-be/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Everything has hit at once. Everywhere there are scenes of a society at the breaking point: of angry protesters and destructive demonstrations; of police forces that have unleashed nearly unrestrained violence on those in the streets, in an apparent effort to prove the point of their most militant critics; of governors calling the National Guard to try to regain control of their cities. The sheer scale and reach of the unrest — the extent to which it seems to represent a crisis of legitimacy as much as a reaction to police violence — has invited comparisons to 1968, the year in which much of America was rocked by protests and riots of even greater scale and destruction. And as The New York Times reports, President Donald Trump’s advisers are among those making the comparison: Some in the president’s circle see the escalations as a political boon, much in the way Richard M. Nixon won the presidency on a law-and-order platform after the 1968 riots. One adviser to Mr. Trump, who insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, said images of widespread destruction could be helpful to the law-and-order message that Mr. Trump has projected since his 2016 campaign. The immediate reason to discount a political analogy between then and now — between Nixon and Trump — is that Trump isn’t a challenger to the incumbent president; he is the incumbent. And whereas Nixon’s “law and order” was a contrast with and rebuke to Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Party, a Trump attempt to play the hits and recapitulate that campaign would only be an attack on his own tenure. You can’t promise “law and order” when disorder is happening on your watch. There are other unavoidable problems with any attempt by Trump to adopt Nixon’s 1968 campaign for his own purposes. As former vice president to Dwight Eisenhower — who led the nation at a time when the white American majority felt culturally and economically secure — Nixon could credibly claim to represent stability in the face of chaos, a steady hand in an uncertain time. Trump can do no such thing. He built his entire political persona around discord and disruption. Having promised to throw the system into disarray, Trump could not then sell himself as an avatar of order and control. He can sell himself as an avatar of violence — as he did when he ordered federal law enforcement to attack peaceful protesters for the sake of a photo op, after promising to use military force against protesters — but there’s no evidence that most Americans want that kind of “leadership.” Nor could he present himself as a steadfast authority in the way that Nixon did throughout that campaign. In the face of unrest, Trump has all but abdicated leadership, retreating to a presidential bunker while he orders the nation’s governors to repress demonstrations. “You have to dominate or you’ll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,” Trump said in a Situation Room phone call with the governors. “It’s a movement, if you don’t put it down it will get worse and worse. The only time it’s successful is when you’re weak and most of you are weak.” When he did attempt to speak to the nation, through Twitter of course, it was to promise violent retribution against protesters. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he said, adding that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase first used in 1967 by Walter Headley, the chief of police in Miami, also in reference to stopping protests and civil unrest. A “law-and-order” campaign just isn’t available to Trump. If there is anyone who occupies a similar position to Nixon in this campaign, it’s Joe Biden, the vice president to a still-popular former president who is running as the candidate of normalcy and stability. The simple truth is that comparisons to 1968 should be made sparingly. Yes, we have mass civil unrest, but it’s impossible at this stage to say how it will play out in November and you can’t simply plot the circumstances of a half-century ago onto the present. There are too many differences. There is no Vietnam War or disintegrating Democratic coalition. Our unrest is happening against a backdrop of deprivation and deep inequality, not the relative prosperity of the late 1960s. And while Trump benefits from a devoted coalition, it remains a vocal minority, not a “silent majority.” Article continues below The protests are different too, encompassing a large, diverse cross-section of America. In turn, there appears to be greater sympathy for the protesters and their grievances, so much so that most public officials outside of the president and his closest allies have shown some understanding of the anger and discontent even as they oppose riots and disorder. All of this gets to a larger point. History can be incredibly useful for analyzing and understanding the present — that is, in fact, the aim of much of my writing. But we shouldn’t forget that our circumstances are not theirs, and our future cannot be divined from the events of the past. We simply do not know what comes next, nor can we predict the events that — as we have seen with the pandemic and the killing of George Floyd — can move an entire nation from one path to the other. As we try to understand the forces at work in this country, we should do so with profound humility about the limits of what we can know and what we can foresee. We should remember that the past, like the present, was contingent; that events that seem inevitable could have gone a different way; that those who lived through them were, like us, unable to see how things would unfold. We should be aware of the past — we should understand the processes that produced our world — but it shouldn’t be a substitute for thinking. We are not them, and now is not then. Jamelle Bouie",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

Leavitt went after Reyes accepting tens of thousands of dollars from organizations such as the Republican Attorneys General Association and a brine shrimp company, saying the attorney general’s office is “for sale” as it has been in the past. Reyes, he said, simply goes where the money is. “Why does a brine shrimp need an attorney general?” Leavitt asked. Reyes said there are no allegations that any decision he has made to investigate or not to investigate or prosecute a case was influenced by a campaign contribution. “The people that donate know they get no special treatment,” he said, adding they know that they’re not buying influence and if they think that they are, it’s a “terrible investment.” He noted that he went after Google in a nationwide lawsuit despite receiving a donation from the company. Leavitt said Reyes is “duty bound” to follow the Republican Attorneys General Association because it gives him so much money. Reyes countered that although the organization is made up like-minded “true conservatives,” he has stood up to the GOP on issues such as the Indian Child Welfare Act. Reyes said the attorney general’s office is a law office. “It’s not a political office first,” he said, conceding it has politics around it and every legal decision has a political implication. He said he avoids hyperpartisanship by representing the people. He called Leavitt’s accusations about partisanship “pure campaign rhetoric, pure nonsense.” Leavitt said it’s “laughable” for Reyes to say he avoids politics. “There has not been an attorney general in recent memory more politically aligned with one party and that advances the interests of one party more than Mr. Reyes,” he said. While Reyes and Leavitt pounded on each other at the Utah Debate Commission event, Democratic attorney general candidate Greg Skordas live tweeted his own answers to the debate questions. Afterward, Skordas said he hopes Utahns would see the debate as a wake-up call. Both Republican candidates, he said, would give the attorney general’s office more of the same. The winner of the June 30 GOP primary will face Skordas in the November general election. “David Leavitt seems solely focused on criminal justice reform, and Sean Reyes continues to make political maneuvers,” Skordas said. Leavitt worked his primary issue — criminal justice reform — into as many answers as he could during the hourlong debate at the University of Utah. He favors pushing cases to trial instead of plea bargains because he says “our very liberty is at stake.” He also favors alternate forms of punishment other than prison for nonviolent offenders. “It is the issue of our generation and the reason Mr. Reyes doesn’t want to talk about it is because he hasn’t done it,” Leavitt said. Reyes said there are more issues in the race than criminal justice reform and “anybody that tells you that it is isn’t qualified to be the attorney general.” He said he has supported state and federal criminal justice reform and brought reintegration programs to the state. He called Leavitt’s proposal to take every case to a jury trial a “charade” and “Quixotic idea” that government can’t afford. Of the national and state racial unrest, Leavitt said it’s a symptom of government not listening and not holding police accountable for their actions. Prosecutors, including Reyes, do not view themselves properly as a check on police, he said. “They view themselves as someone trying to be part of their club. While we need to work with the police, we can’t be part of the club with police because we are their check,” Leavitt said. Reyes called Leavitt “uninformed” and he said he has filed lawsuits against sheriffs, police chiefs and law enforcement officers. The recent violence overshadows the message of racial inequality, he said. “As a person of color, I understand it very deeply. I know it. I feel it. Just because I’m the attorney general doesn’t immunize me from it,” Reyes said. Leavitt said Reyes is shirking his duty to oversee and lead county attorneys in the state. Leavitt said even though he’s been out pushing criminal justice reform, Tuesday was the first time he has seen Reyes in person since becoming Utah County attorney 18 months ago. “He can’t say he’s leading because I’ve never seen him,” he said. Reyes said maybe he’s never seen Leavitt because he’s received more complaints about him from leaders and residents than any other public official. The state, he said, doesn’t dictate how elected county attorneys do their jobs. “My opponent would want to be an emperor and tell and dictate to county attorneys what they should do,” Reyes said.",0.0

George Orwell got it only half right. In “1984” he envisioned a future in which video technology was the friend only of oppressive governments, allowing them to keep constant tabs on everyone. But while phones can indeed invade privacy, and oppressive regimes use technology to control subjects, the momentum instead has been in favor of freedom, giving the masses an ability to record video in ways governments can’t control or explain away. Any modern reader might suggest that Orwell’s protagonist, Winston Smith, should turn on his phone when authorities close in, start a Facebook Live and let the world know what is happening to him. Imagine a world in which police knelt on the neck of George Floyd, squeezing the life out of him, and no one had video proof. Imagine a world in which Ahmaud Arbery was indiscriminately shot while jogging in Georgia and no one was there to film it. Actually, it’s not hard to imagine that one. No one was charged in the case until the video surfaced — further evidence of the power of amateur videography. Imagine Rodney King without the video of him being beaten. For that matter, imagine the assassination of President John F. Kennedy if Abraham Zapruder had been just one of dozens recording every move. Imagine how each of these has challenged assumptions and changed attitudes. Nearly 160 years ago, photographer Matthew Brady began this photographic revolution by hauling heavy carts of photo chemicals, plates and cameras around Civil War battlefields, taking pictures of the bloody aftermath. He set in motion today’s world. Even in black and white, these images hit their mark. In October 1862, the New York Times said Brady had effectively brought bodies from the war and “laid them in our dooryards and along the streets.” “The living that throng Broadway care little perhaps for the dead at Antietam,” the Times said, “but we fancy they would jostle less carelessly down the great thoroughfare, saunter less at their ease, were a few dripping bodies, fresh from the field, laid along the pavement. There would be a gathering up of skirts and a careful picking of way; conversation would be less lively, and the general air of pedestrians more subdued.” Today, the bodies, the beaten and oppressed, the victims of disasters, and the disasters themselves — from fires to earthquakes to tsunamis and tornados — are regularly deposited on our dooryards and along our streets in graphic detail. The question is, are our conversations less lively? Are we more subdued? Or are we so awash in graphic images that this, too, has changed us? Video from recent protests can be compiled to support whatever narrative one chooses. One scene from Salt Lake City shows a police officer knocking over an elderly man with a cane who stood along the side of the road, then subsequently helping him up. There are plenty of videos showing police treating people harshly, but there are just as many showing vandals overturning a police vehicle, breaking windows and screaming in the faces of officers. Social media regularly feeds us images that have been altered to pretend to tell the truth, such as a photo from a television show that was used a few days ago to convince people Washington landmarks were ablaze and the mainstream media was ignoring it. One of the great untruths, of course, is that photos never lie. Context, point of view and editing still matter. But so does the sheer volume of cameras being held aloft in a 21st century pose. A photo may lie, but hundreds of them taken at once can’t escape the truth. Combine smartphones with nearly omnipresent security cameras, and you neutralize a scoundrel’s best friend: darkness. For centuries, the poor and disadvantaged were left with their word when it came to reporting abuses, and their word was generally considered less credible than the word of those in privileged positions. Yes, this is a generation jaded by never-ending images, and often fooled by clever editing. Yes, we are saturated by things that would have shocked our ancestors. But thank goodness we are not beyond feeling when real brutality is laid on our dooryards.",0.0

They face a variety of charges, including aggravated assault, simple battery, pointing or aiming a gun, and criminal damage to property. The officers were recorded on video breaking the windows of a vehicle and pulling Taniyah Pilgrim out, and using a stun gun on Messiah Young on Saturday. At the time of the incident, Pilgrim, 20, and Young, 22, both students at historically black colleges — Morehouse and Spellman — were in a vehicle leaving a protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said they broke the city’s curfew. One officer wrote in the police report that he didn’t know if either of the two students was armed. “I heard officers say gun two-three times,” the unnamed officer wrote. “Not being able to see the hands of the passenger and being that she was in my immediate sight I deployed my city-issued taser to diffuse the situation.” Howard said Pilgrim and Young “were so innocent almost to the point of being naive.” “The conduct in this incident isn’t indicative of the way we treat people in the city of Atlanta and it certainly isn’t indicative of how we treat our children,” he added. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms fired Gardner and Streeter on Sunday. The other four officers were on desk duty. The Georgia NAACP compared the incident to other police use of force against African Americans across the country. “We are done with the brutality and dehumanization of black bodies,” the Rev. James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, said Sunday. Gardner and Streeter are black, while Claud, Hood, Jones and Sauls are white.

Speaking through a megaphone, Davis asked law enforcement to stop treating him and other black people like animals. “We have no reason to protest when we are treated fairly,"" Davis said. Deonno Avila, another participant, said his family is Mexican Chicano and has experienced law enforcement bias in Utah. “We have always seen a racism and bigotry in the police department, whether it’s being pulled over for just the way we look, or anything else,” said Avila, of Salt Lake City. Leaders of the demonstration urged participants to remain peaceful, with one Black Lives Matter advocate warning that anyone acting violent would be removed from the assembly. But they spoke forcefully through chants and handwritten signs that read, “I can’t breathe,” and, “Don’t shoot.""

A handful of marchers headed up State Street toward Capitol Hill but appeared to disperse along the way. Earlier Tuesday, Salt Lake City police officials and the mayor met to talk about law enforcement policies with community leaders, including prominent African Americans. Reporters were permitted into the meeting room as the session was winding down. Chief Mike Brown asked the gathered group to reassure the community that the Salt Lake City Police Department is seeking to learn and grow. ""And we have confidence that the things that you saw happen in Minneapolis are not going to happen here,"" he said. ""Because, right now, there's a lot of fear."" Addressing the media after the meeting, state Rep. Sandra Hollins, the state’s only black lawmaker, said she learned during the session that Salt Lake City police are not allowed to kneel on a person’s neck as a form of restraint — the way a Minneapolis officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd before his death. While she appreciated Tuesday’s dialogue, the protests point to the feeling of voicelessness that many experience, she said, referencing the African proverb that a “child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.” “I think that’s what’s going on. I think our youth are not feeling that they are being heard,” Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, said. “And this is a part of the consequence of them not being heard.” Salt Lake City is one of dozens of U.S. cities where multi-day protests have taken place in reaction to the Floyd’s death. Floyd was handcuffed when now-former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. He died later that night at the hospital. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Protesters in Salt Lake City took to the streets for the first time Saturday morning. As they day wore on at least 1,000 came out to the Utah State Capitol and the area around police headquarters and Library Square. They flipped one police cruiser and set it ablaze, another car — belonging to a man who threatened protests with a bow and arrow — was also overturned and set on fire. Officers arrested 46 people, and 21 officers were treated for injuries, mostly heat-related. Kamaal Ahmad, Weber State University football coach, left Tuesday’s listening session appreciative of the open communication with Salt Lake City leaders. Over the weekend, Ahmad had posted a widely-shared video on social media expressing dismay at the violence that had erupted, and he reiterated those sentiments to reporters Tuesday. “I’ve been to legitimate protests. That wasn’t one,” he said. “That was a bunch of agitators that wanted to cause harm.” Ahmad said he’s helping organize a peaceful demonstration Saturday in downtown Salt Lake City. In response to Saturday’s violence, Mendenhall enacted a citywide curfew that ended Monday morning. Then on Monday, she announced a weeklong curfew that begins each night at 8 p.m, and ends at 6 a.m. Protesters also gathered Monday and challenged that curfew, staying out until about 10 p.m., when a demonstrator negotiated with police to let the remaining crowd leave without getting arrested. Monday’s protest stayed mostly peaceful, but officials reported someone had shattered the window of an armored vehicle. Court records show 18 protesters were arrested and booked into Salt Lake County jail, including one who’d been carrying a loaded handgun. Police also made two other protest-related arrests: A man who’d allegedly been making threats to kill police and was found apparently on his way to the protest with four guns, and a man who lives near the protest site who fired an assault rifle-style gun in the air during the demonstration. Salt Lake City police reported they’d made 16 total arrests, mostly for failure to disperse. The Utah Highway Patrol arrested two people.",0.0
1623744283,2020-06-02 20:00:09,Will Sartain: Stand together and strive to understand,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/will-sartain-stand/,en,False,,78,The Salt Lake Tribune ,http://www.sltrib.com/,"Saturday afternoon at 3:30, our team of remaining employees (post pandemic) came together on a Zoom call to discuss the protests unfolding downtown. We quickly all agreed that it would be the best decision to cancel our concert/bike event that was scheduled to be held at various locations downtown that evening, as well as the following night. For the past two and a half months, our group has been running in circles on how to find a way to survive. Though it was heartbreaking to put so much work into these first initial attempts of organizing music again in our city, it seemed to be the right choice and we were at peace. As we finished the call, I was glued to the news reports as things quickly escalated. I began to realize this was a historical moment. There have been many instances of unjustified police murders perpetrated on American citizens that had not resulted in this type of response both locally and nationally. It was a lot to unpack. Some people on social media spoke about their disapproval of looting and rioting. The interesting thing I have noticed is, very few people actually support these actions within my social network. And that is complicated. In my opinion, this was a perfect storm of sorts to push forward a movement of holding police officers who commit crimes accountable. There are some who have said things like, “A lot of cops are good people.” And, while I agree, this isn’t the issue. The issue is accountability. I would argue that these protests were so intense and so different that positive change will come from this. Is looting and rioting positive in general? No. Is it unfortunate for those that are negatively affected? Absolutely. But what we saw across America put politicians and police squarely focused on the issue that these protests were meant to serve. And, in my opinion, these actions created progress in that sense. My feeling at the end of the day was not of certainty like many of my peers. The feeling I was left with was uncertainty. Curiosity to know and understand more. To do something meaningful within and outside of the things within my skill set. To engage meaningfully with my community. To understand the layers. To understand the history. The truth is, it is easy for anyone to adopt the cause of racial equality. Our moral compass guides us to that conclusion. But the harder part is more nuanced. To reach meaningful change in any arena takes time. It takes patience. It takes acceptance of self and others. It takes love. It takes feeling safe within our social groups. It takes being uncomfortable. Real change is hard. My concern is that tribalism and group-think will simplify racial equality for many. After the protest is over, what will we do as individuals? How will we leave the world a better place? In truth, I don’t know yet, but I am willing to try and willing to learn. Article continues below For the last 18 years, I have worked with musicians from around the country and around the world. We will continue to host diverse events with people from all walks of life. We love, accept and appreciate so many people who have performed and attended our spaces. Things that came out of Saturday’s protest remind me that I need to work harder, to try and understand, to study history and to love. No matter what your opinion of these events are, I hope we can be kind. That we can empathize with people. Look for deeper change that will impact things for a long time to come. And, most importantly, stand together and strive to better understand one another. Will Sartain",0.0

You can see that there’s a human behind these posters, behind these hashtags, behind these statistics.” Warren, too, encouraged Utah County residents to stand in solidarity with the black community and other marginalized people. The Black Lives Matter movement, she said, does not negate the fact that all lives matter but focuses the conversation on a community that has been targeted and wants to feel safe. “We want that for everyone. We want that for the Hispanics who are locked in cages right now. We want that for the gay people who feel like a hate crime might be committed against them because they show who they truly are,” Warren said. “We want it for everyone, not just for black people, but this is where we start because this is one of the most prominent problems in today’s America.” Both Cadet and Warren called for justice for black people and others who have been harmed by police brutality or prejudice in the criminal justice system. Protester and veteran Thomas Durham expressed the hope that more police officers would eventually show support for protesters. “The face that I can just kind of be gunned down in my own home is wrong on every level.” A protester displays her sign at University Parkway and State Street in Orem June 2.

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

Kerry Gibson, Blake Moore, Bob Stevenson and Katie Witt participated in an hourlong debate hosted by the Utah Debate Commission and livestreamed on Facebook and Zoom on Tuesday. They hope to take the seat held by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, who is not seeking reelection and instead is running as a lieutenant governor on the GOP ticket with gubernatorial candidate Thomas Wright. All four condemned the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police that has sparked multiple riots across the county, but disavowed the violence and destruction of private property. Witt, the Kaysville mayor, invoked President Donald Trump’s name frequently and said she supports federal military intervention if necessary, as the president threatened. “When it comes to antifa, if state governments are not taking care of that problem, I support President Trump in taking a stance. I believe they are a terrorist organization and they should be dealt with as such.” Moore said the civil unrest in this country demonstrates the urgent need for change. “We need to stop the anarchy that is happening in our cities,” he said, adding there is a need for criminal justice reform, but the best response is a local response. Gibson, too, said he is opposed to federal intervention. “Not in my America. We don’t need the military in Salt Lake City. We have the resources to handle this in the state of Utah.” Stevenson said responses to riots are best handled by local police — and Davis County, where he serves as commissioner — sent dozens of officers to Salt Lake City to assist police there. The National Guard, under state purview, is also appropriate to use as a resource, he said. All candidates hammered on China as the biggest foreign threat to the United States. Moore, a former foreign service officer who worked in intelligence in Asia, said his experience from that makes him uniquely qualified to navigate that territory. But Witt jumped on his statements about building relationships. “What he is advocating is the same old same old,” Witt said, stressing it hasn’t worked. Gibson, a dairy farmer and former state legislator, said COVID-19 exposed the threat from China and shed much needed light on the insecurity of the nation’s food supply. “For far too long the nation has taken domestic food production for granted, and that needs to change,” he said. Stevenson said the proposed fourth stage of COVID-19 relief spending for Americans should be dead on arrival because it is too exorbitant and full of pork. “This type of spending is crazy,” he said. All candidates jumped on the federal deficit, saying it is a spending path that needs severe correction. Moore said that is one of the main reasons he got into the race. “We need to reverse the debt culture,” he said. Stevenson pointed to his record of cutting taxes twice while mayor of Layton, while Gibson emphasized his experience in the Utah Legislature during the Great Recession when legislators had to make significant budget cuts. “We went through it line by line,” he said. “I was in the room at the table making sure our budget came into line with our new reality.” Witt said cutting federal regulations, as Trump has, will help businesses flourish and provide more revenue to bolster the economy. “We need to stop spending so much money,” she said, adding to do that, “Federal government needs to stay in its own lane.” Witt has taken criticism for agreeing to host a country-western business-stay-open-themed concert in her city, which has since been booted elsewhere. She said in the debate that the government shutdowns were too extreme. “I think it was a mistake in retrospect to force everybody to close down. We need to let people earn a living.” Stevenson, however, asked why she was supportive of keeping pickleball recreation shuttered but not a concert. Witt responded she agreed to concur with other Davis County mayors’ sentiments. The debate now sets the stage for the June 30 primary.",0.0

Over the weekend, Ahmad had posted a widely-shared video on social media expressing dismay at the violence that had erupted, and he reiterated those sentiments to reporters Tuesday. “I’ve been to legitimate protests. That wasn’t one,” he said. “That was a bunch of agitators that wanted to cause harm.” Ahmad said he’s helping organize a peaceful demonstration Saturday in downtown Salt Lake City. In response to Saturday’s violence, Mendenhall enacted a citywide curfew that ended Monday morning. Then on Monday, she announced a weeklong curfew that begins each night at 8 p.m, and ends at 6 a.m. Protesters also gathered Monday and challenged that curfew, staying out until about 10 p.m., when a demonstrator negotiated with police to let the remaining crowd leave without getting arrested. Monday’s protest stayed mostly peaceful, but officials reported someone had shattered the window of an armored vehicle. Court records show 18 protesters were arrested and booked into Salt Lake County jail, including one who’d been carrying a loaded handgun. Police also made two other protest-related arrests: A man who’d allegedly been making threats to kill police and was found apparently on his way to the protest with four guns, and a man who lives near the protest site who fired an assault rifle-style gun in the air during the demonstration. Salt Lake City police reported they’d made 16 total arrests, mostly for failure to disperse. The Utah Highway Patrol arrested two people.",0.0
1623750241,2020-06-02 20:00:09,Will Sartain: Stand together and strive to understand,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/06/02/will-sartain-stand/,en,False,,663622,Now Salt Lake,http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment,"Saturday afternoon at 3:30, our team of remaining employees (post pandemic) came together on a Zoom call to discuss the protests unfolding downtown. We quickly all agreed that it would be the best decision to cancel our concert/bike event that was scheduled to be held at various locations downtown that evening, as well as the following night. For the past two and a half months, our group has been running in circles on how to find a way to survive. Though it was heartbreaking to put so much work into these first initial attempts of organizing music again in our city, it seemed to be the right choice and we were at peace. As we finished the call, I was glued to the news reports as things quickly escalated. I began to realize this was a historical moment. There have been many instances of unjustified police murders perpetrated on American citizens that had not resulted in this type of response both locally and nationally. It was a lot to unpack. Some people on social media spoke about their disapproval of looting and rioting. The interesting thing I have noticed is, very few people actually support these actions within my social network. And that is complicated. In my opinion, this was a perfect storm of sorts to push forward a movement of holding police officers who commit crimes accountable. There are some who have said things like, “A lot of cops are good people.” And, while I agree, this isn’t the issue. The issue is accountability. I would argue that these protests were so intense and so different that positive change will come from this. Is looting and rioting positive in general? No. Is it unfortunate for those that are negatively affected? Absolutely. But what we saw across America put politicians and police squarely focused on the issue that these protests were meant to serve. And, in my opinion, these actions created progress in that sense. My feeling at the end of the day was not of certainty like many of my peers. The feeling I was left with was uncertainty. Curiosity to know and understand more. To do something meaningful within and outside of the things within my skill set. To engage meaningfully with my community. To understand the layers. To understand the history. The truth is, it is easy for anyone to adopt the cause of racial equality. Our moral compass guides us to that conclusion. But the harder part is more nuanced. To reach meaningful change in any arena takes time. It takes patience. It takes acceptance of self and others. It takes love. It takes feeling safe within our social groups. It takes being uncomfortable. Real change is hard. My concern is that tribalism and group-think will simplify racial equality for many. After the protest is over, what will we do as individuals? How will we leave the world a better place? In truth, I don’t know yet, but I am willing to try and willing to learn. Article continues below For the last 18 years, I have worked with musicians from around the country and around the world. We will continue to host diverse events with people from all walks of life. We love, accept and appreciate so many people who have performed and attended our spaces. Things that came out of Saturday’s protest remind me that I need to work harder, to try and understand, to study history and to love. No matter what your opinion of these events are, I hope we can be kind. That we can empathize with people. Look for deeper change that will impact things for a long time to come. And, most importantly, stand together and strive to better understand one another. Will Sartain",0.0

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

That marks the sixth day in a row of more than 200 new cases. State epidemiologist Angela Dunn said the spike is concerning, and likely due to Memorial Day celebrations and graduation parties. Dunn said recent protests could also contribute to higher numbers, and health officials will be watching how the events might impact cases over the next few weeks. She said a continued upward trend would be worrying. But they are working on targeted messaging to keep people aware of the pandemic. — Jon Reed Follow KUER’s coverage of the coronavirus in Utah.

Between the City and County building, Plaza 349 and the Justice Courts, nearly 40 windows were busted. At the public safety building — which houses police and firefighters, several panels of reinforced glass were damaged too. City officials said parking signs, benches, bike racks, and other smaller items were also defiled during the protest. As for police cars, one was totaled after being flipped and set on fire, and two more are in the body shop. Officials don’t yet have an estimate on how much the repairs will cost the city. — Ross Terrell Weber State University Condemns Professor’s Tweets Administrators at Weber State University are condemning tweets by a criminal justice professor during demonstrations last weekend protesting the death of George Floyd. The university said in a statement Monday that tweets by longtime professor Scott Senjo were ""abhorrent.” Senjo tweeted support for damage to CNN headquarters and commented on a post that seems to support a police car driving into protesters. The university says an investigation is underway to determine if other measures would be taken to ensure campus safety. — Associated Press Salt Lake City Police Meet With Community Leaders The Salt Lake City Police Department along with Mayor Erin Mendenhall met with community leaders on Tuesday to review police policy.

Adam Smith, D-Wash., wants the Trump administration and the Pentagon to offer more detail about potential domestic deployments of the U.S. military in response to protest activity in the United States. Smith, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, on Tuesay told reporters he intends to hold a hearing and call Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley to clarify the Pentagon’s intentions. In particular, he said, he was concerned about Esper’s comment in a call to U.S. governors, the recording of which was leaked to the New York Times on Monday. During the call, Esper said that National Guard forces need to “dominate the battlespace,” referring to police brutality protests that have roiled U.S. cities over the past week. “Talking about the United States of America as a battlespace that he wants to occupy is wrong,” Smith said. Smith said he called Milley on Monday to express his concerns about a potential military response to protests, as well as Milley’s appearance in uniform on the streets of Washington, D.C., Monday night, and has reached out to Esper to talk but hadn’t heard back yet. HASC staff are also working through more formal channels to convene a Congressional hearing as soon as possible, Smith said. On Monday evening, President Donald Trump said he would mobilize all federal resources to quell protest activity, and encouraged governors in all states to call up the National Guard. “If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said at the White House Rose Garden Monday. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), on Twitter and in an interview with Fox News Monday, spoke in favor of using military force to quell protests. If local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let’s see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they’re facing off with the 101st Airborne Division. We need to have zero tolerance for this destruction. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state would not request military assistance, and said the President’s declaration was illegal. In order to activate the military to operate domestically, Trump would have to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, which White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday he is considering. Smith said “we need to bring peace back to our streets,” but also said Trump has not taken the concerns of protesters seriously. Smith added that he was concerned that what he called “Trump’s sycophantic approach to leadership” has adversely affected decision making by DoD leaders. “It’s almost like he doesn’t believe peaceful protesters exist or that there’s anything to peacefully protest,” Smith said.",0.0

The protest began at 11 a.m. near 500 South and Denver Street. Protesters, both on foot and in cars, proceeded to the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building, chanting “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace” while carrying signs that bore names of the many black lives lost in recent police-related incidents. “The only change that I want, is for change to actually happen, plain and simple,” said protester Lina De La Flor. Palacios Carbajal’s mother stood on the steps of the Utah State Capitol and spoke to the crowd about the death of her son. “Bernardo was 22 years old. He had a lot of dreams and a lot of things he wanted to do in life … the police killed him half a block from the bar … and no one wants to tell us anything,” she told supporters around 1:30 p.m. Palacios Carbajal’s mother rallied protesters at the Capitol to continue to push for change. “They need to stop killing our children,” she said. “We need respect! We need to be united!” As demonstrators arrived at the police station downtown, two young men climbed on top of the northwest entrance. Some protesters wrote obscenities on the building while others chanted and threw eggs and tomatoes from below. Tensions escalated around 3 p.m. when demonstrators flipped a Salt Lake City police vehicle and set it ablaze. Looting of a nearby 7-11 and the City Creek Center soon followed as the protest went from peaceful to violent. Protesters also graffitied the Capitol grounds and chanted outside the building as the Utah Highway Patrol stood outside the entrance. In response to the increasing vandalism and destruction of property, Gov. Gary Herbert tweeted, “We condemn violence and looting. I have activated the National Guard to help control the escalating situation in downtown Salt Lake City. I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” We condemn violence and looting.

Maybe all this will show them once and for all that we are tired of nothing happening! The more the police murder, the stronger the protests will get.” Utah Against Police Brutality issued a statement following the protest, saying in part: “This is what happens when the people get tired of waiting for Salt Lake and Utah to do something about racist cops and police violence.”",0.0

Salt Lake City more resembled the chaos of what I have seen on the news for decades in situations like these, but never expected to see in a city I know so well. What began as peaceful protests organized by Utah Against Police Brutality — motivated by the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd — quickly devolved into chaos and danger after a police vehicle was overturned, looted and set ablaze. As I sat in the KSL newsroom, watching five different reporters in the field, I felt fear. Not the fear you experience when skydiving or finding a spider in your bathtub, but a paralyzing fear that seeps into every thought and action — fear for my family, my city, my coworkers and my country. As tensions increased, protesters moved from the downtown library to the Utah State Capitol. Utah Highway Patrol troopers formed a line at the steps in front of the building and met the growing masses as they advocated for justice. Watching a significant group of people — most peaceful, but some with ill intention — terrified me. As the crowds moved, they tagged graffiti on buildings, both commercial and private, before heading into a neighborhood that I call my home. I was unsure if they would stop at the Capitol or continue into the homes and apartments that occupy the hills nearby. After 20-30 minutes at the Capitol, most protesters returned downtown to Library Square, where the situation was steadily deteriorating. Over a period of 1-2 hours, officers began arriving to restore order. Salt Lake, West Valley and Unified Police departments were the first on scene, followed by units from across the Wasatch Front. I looked on as officers formed a defensive line, while the crowd swelled and seemed to become increasingly agitated. Protesters hurled water bottles, rocks, knives, fireworks, and other objects at the officers, the media and each other. It was the definition of a powder keg waiting for a spark. That spark came when a man wielding a bow and arrow attempted to fire into the crowd and was subdued and beaten by protesters before police were able to remove him. Fortunately, that spark did not ignite. Perhaps, it was the short, heavy downpour, or maybe the incredible restraint from police and peaceful protesters throughout the crowd. Tensions ebbed and flowed for several hours, but never boiled over. The crowd fully dispersed near 11 p.m. — a full eight hours after the initial burning of the police vehicle and nearly 11 hours since the protests began. A long night left me nervous for what I would see in the morning. Amazingly, strength and comradery were already showing as I walked the Capitol grounds just after 9 a.m. Professional cleaning crews, volunteers and police came together to clean remnants of an ugly evening. I must admit, I was filled with pride for the way residents of Salt Lake responded in this moment of need. May 30, 2020, is a day that will live in infamy for Utah. All told, 46 arrests were made — most for failure to disperse — and 21 police officers were injured. I hope all of this was not in vain. I hope that Salt Lake suffered in advance of future growth and improved understanding and treatment of all people, no matter their race. As a society, we must cast aside our differences and focus on what bring us together: humanity. Hate divides us, but love and understanding can bring us together.

On Tuesday that movement shifted in a large way to social media in the form of Blackout Tuesday. In honor of Blackout Tuesday, millions of people around the world have posted an empty black square to their social media pages in solidarity of the Black Lives Matter movement and in support of protesters. Two black musicians, Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang started the online demonstration this weekend, calling it “The Show Must Be Paused.”It was initially intended only for the music industry but it’s evolved significantly past musicians and record labels. Utah businesswoman and advocate Karen Rodriguez explained the campaign was, “An effort to fill up their feed with the stories of black people and racial justice.” Rodriguez is the founder and CEO of Code in Color, a group that helps find and prepares young people of color in Utah for tech jobs, and a member of the Utah Black Chamber of Commerce. She said this week has been hard, but the momentum is promising. “If you want to be able to stand in solidarity, stand in solidarity in a protest, stand in solidarity on your social, but stand in solidarity where it counts, with your money, ” she said. Giles Witherspoon-Boyd is also a member of the Black Chamber; he’s the co-owner and CEO of Protocol Enterprises. He called this time of COVID-19 and national unrest, “The hardest thing I’ve ever done.” Witherspoon-Boyd explained the same racism creating this social climate also makes running a business in Utah more challenging then it comes to financing and visibility. “We don’t have the support that other businesses have; I’m not saying that other businesses aren’t affected, that would be dishonest and wrong, but I’m saying for us it’s even tougher. So if you can look out, please do it.” The Utah Black Chamber has created an easy way for Utahns to help entrepreneurs of color: The Black Pages. It’s a list of businesses and resources run by people of color. Witherspoon-Boyd said, “It’s not enough to say I’m not racist, and this goes for everybody. We have to learn to be an anti-racist.” LATEST NEWS STORIES:",0.0

Salt Lake City saw two protests — one near the State Capitol, which began Tuesday afternoon and stretched into the evening, and one at Washington Square, the home of the Salt Lake City-County Building. Both were impromptu and without official organization. While about 100 people lined the streets near the Capitol, about 300 marched around Washington Square for several hours, stopping for speeches and to interact with police and National Guard soldiers posted by the intersections. “We are here to unite, not fight,” said Hasson Davis, who addressed the crowd through a megaphone gathered at 400 South 200 East. “I am not an angry black man, but I am fed up.” Davis said the fear he feels is exhausting. “I feel like I have PTSD from watching this over and over,” said Davis, who called himself an activist, although he’s not affiliated with any organization. “I never caused harm to nobody, but I see the harm that was done. I have seen the bullet holes. I’ve seen people die. ... I don’t know what’s going to stop it.” The protests Tuesday night were not organized by a specific group, and people took turns speaking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. One of the more moving moments was when Davis offered his megaphone to a young woman who didn’t want to be identified, but who eloquently explained why the frustration that has boiled over will not recede any time soon. Black Americans, she said, are tired of being killed while jogging, while smoking, while sleeping, while sitting in their own homes, while playing in parks and walking through neighborhoods. Tory Quinn Crosby, who is with the Northern Utah Chapter of Black Lives Matter, attended the protest and asked the people of color from the crowd to join her in shaking hands with any police officer or soldier willing. She and others shook hands and talked briefly. “You guys have been amazing keeping it peaceful the last couple of days,” Crosby yelled through the megaphone. “I had to come out here. ... We are a powerful and strong movement, and we need to stick to that. These officers here are civilians just like us.” She got emotional as she talked about taking a knee with police and soldiers one street over just before she joined the protest. “We are not here to destroy our city,” Crosby said. At one point several people argued with her about whether or not begging police to kneel with them or shake their hands did any good. Crosby was adamant that connecting with officers and soldiers allowed them to see them as human beings — not stereotypes. “We want to be looked at like normal people. We just want humanity,” she said.

At one point the group marched around the Capitol’s grounds, clutching signs and continuing to cheer and chant. Among them was Mabel Bates, who said Tuesday was her third protest. “I’m here today to support people of color and use my white body as a barricade maybe if police officers decide to get violent,” Bates said. “I feel like with my white privilege comes a responsibility to protect my fellow human beings.” Police stood in a line at the front of the Capitol building’s steps, growing in number as the afternoon stretched on. The two groups largely did not interact with one another before 8 p.m., with the exception of several protesters who crossed the street to converse with officers. One woman sat nearby to sketch the protesters. Others passed out water bottles and masks to those congregating on either side of the street. Nolan Powe, who is black, said he lives in a predominately white town and has experienced racism and been racially profiled. “We really want to see a change in our system because black people are still getting racially profiled,” said Powe, who led chants outside the Capitol. “African Americans are still being racially profiled, especially in Utah. I guess me and the crowd would love it if we could get treated equally.” Powe plans to continue going to protests and spreading awareness. “I will not rest until George Floyd’s family gets justice and until either President (Donald) Trump condemns the act of the officers and makes right of it or until they simply put this to bed,” he said. The crowd dispersed peacefully at about 8:10 p.m. when police crossed the street and told them they needed to leave for the night because of Salt Lake City’s curfew, put in place this week following destructive riots over the weekend. Before leaving, protesters called for the officers to take a knee with them, their cries intensifying as police crossed the street. A peaceful group also assembled in Logan. In Ogden, about 20 teens and young adults held signs near City Hall on the corner of 25th and Washington Boulevard Tuesday afternoon, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “no justice, no peace.” Several drivers honked their horns and raised their fists in solidarity as they passed. According to Sierra Rose, one of the organizers, the youth wanted their protest to be peaceful, so she was encouraging participants to disengage with anyone who tried to antagonize them. Rose said she attended a rally on Sunday that was met with vitriol by passersby. The group saw opposition Tuesday, but protesters instead turned their attention to chanting or cheering. Rose said she doesn’t want their message of justice for Floyd and solidarity within her community to be lost in the screaming and fighting that can happen at protests. The group of protesters ranged in age from 15 to 21. Rose said teens are often excluded from these movements because people think they only show up to take pictures for their social media. Brevan Benard, another organizer, echoed what Rose said, saying he wanted to protest peacefully and give a voice to the youth in the community who were frustrated with policing too. “We believe in change; we came here to motivate and inspire people to not just protest, but to come and do it peacefully,” he said. “We as kids are the next generation.” In Orem, passersby swelled the ranks of what began as a small, honk-and-wave-style protest on the corners of State Street and University Parkway near the University Place Mall. Four men in their 20s said they had been driving around Provo and Orem with signs in their car, looking to join a protest. Juliana Cassiano, 30, of Provo, led call-and-response chants on one corner, yelling “Whose lives matter? Black lives matter!” and “I can’t breath!” “This is a remarkable moment when people have decided to talk about this issue all over the country, so we have a responsibility to educate people about how we’ve lived with so many years of injustice. This is a great moment.” Grid View Protesters demonstrate peacefully as they walk towards police on 200 East between 400 South and 500 South in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 2, 2020.

Allred, Deseret News The protest’s organizer was a 21-year-old Utah Valley University student who gave only her first name, Natasha. She stood on one corner alone at 1:30 p.m., but by 7 p.m. there were more than 70 people carrying signs in the crosswalks and yelling on all four corners. She told each person who joined they had to be civil, lawful and nonviolent. “The people here realize there is a serious injustice happening and a need for reform,” she said. “We’re all standing here in solidarity for George Floyd and for all other victims of police brutality and white supremacy who have gotten no justice.” Hundreds of cars honked in support of the protest, fueled by signs like “Honk if black lives matter.” One man yelled, “Trump 2020” at the protesters from his car in a left turn lane, then flipped them off as he drove past. A verbal skirmish broke out when Hayden Hansen and his father, Tyler, who are white, walked over from Texas Roadhouse and told some of the white protesters that all lives matter. “In my opinion, their lives do matter, but mine matters just as much,” said Hayden Hansen, who would like to be a police officer. The father and son were frustrated when a couple of protesters told them to leave. “We weren’t for (George Floyd) getting killed,” Tyler Hansen said. “I thought that was savage, but these protesters need to know the statistics; cops kill more white men than black men.” Asked if that held true based on the percentage of people of those races in the U.S. population, Hansen said he would look it up. Police encouraged people to go home and leave the city streets at curfew, but they didn’t begin actively enforcing it until about 9 p.m. About 50 people continued protesting, walking partway to the Capitol before turning around and heading south on State Street. Police blocked off streets as they marched in north bound lanes and adjacent sidewalks.",0.0

Tang also led the crowd in chanting “No justice. No peace. No racist police.” Tanzi Propst/Park Record There were many voices, and many messages, on Dozier Field on Monday as Park City gathered in tribute to George Floyd. A crowd of mostly white people remembered Floyd, the black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered demonstrations across the U.S. But it was an Asian American teen who delivered some of the most memorable words on Monday at the Park City High School field. Emma Tang, an 18-year-old who lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, attended high school in Park City for her freshman and sophomore years, returning to the Kearns Boulevard campus on Monday to offer remarks from the perspective of a minority person. Many in the crowd of upward of 300 people appeared captivated as Tang spoke, sometimes using aggressive words. She told the crowd that not being a racist is not enough, that silence by white people amounts to violence and said police officers are racist. Support Local Journalism Donate  “We need your anger all the time, because change starts and ends with you,” she told the crowd. She also led the crowd in chanting “No justice. No peace. No racist police.” Tang rallied on Monday carrying a sign that said “Yellow Peril for Black Power,” using a message with racial undertones dating to prejudiced worries from long ago about the rise of Asians. In interviews afterward, Tang, who graduated from high school in Colorado and plans to attend New York University later this year, said there is “indifference towards racism.” “When I went to school here, I actually faced a lot of anti-Asian sentiments from a lot of my classmates. So, it’s interesting to see how they’ve evolved, which is really good,” Tang said. “But I would say that a lot of white students, not just here but kind of across the nation, aren’t really affected by the racism, so they don’t really feel the need to combat it, I guess. So, I guess, if it’s not called out to them, they don’t necessarily pay attention.” She described the racism she saw while a student in Park City as “micro-aggression rather than outward acts.” Tang said she wants people who attended the event on Monday to better recognize racism and respond. “I think I would really like to see them call out racism in their own personal lives . . . when they see comments, when they see their classmates and their friends and their family doing or saying something that may not even be outwardly racist, but just calling that out. And then really internally checking themselves,” she said.",0.0

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

The poll found that 52% of Utahns like what they’re seeing from the Republican in the White House, while 46% disapprove of the president’s job performance. Just 2% said they weren’t sure how they feel. Trump’s job approval in Utah had reached as high as 57% in March and April. But among a smaller group of likely Republican voters in Utah’s June 30 state primary, the president’s job approval rating jumps to 81%, with just 18% disapproval and only 1% uncertain. Trump easily won Utah’s March 3 presidential primary with nearly 88% of the GOP vote. The poll was conducted by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen for the Deseret News and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics, starting on May 25, the day George Floyd died as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, and ending Sunday, the day after a Salt Lake City protest turned violent. Rasmussen said he believes it’s too soon to say how Utahns will view the president’s response. “It’s pretty unsettled out there right now. So I think maybe you captured a little bit of it,” he said, comparing today’s turmoil to the 1960s when President Richard Nixon declared himself a law-and-order president amid anti-war protests and race riots, just as Trump did Monday when he threatened to deploy U.S. troops to quell unrest. “The parallels are a little bit uncomfortable and very, very unpredictable,” Rasmussen said. At this point, he said the slight decline in the president’s job approval in Utah is likely related more to how he’s handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Hinckley Institute Director Jason Perry said Utahns have been busy sorting out their own feelings toward the situation, especially after Saturday’s protest in downtown Salt Lake City where two cars were burned and both public and private property was vandalized. “There will be Utahns who disapprove of the president’s actions but mostly they’re going to be focused on how our local leaders have approached these protests,” Perry said. “Utahns over the last couple of days have had a chance to look at their own thoughts and feelings about the protests.” He said Utahns have come to the conclusion they want “compassion. They’ve been wanting people to be thoughtful about their approach, and this to be one of the opportunities where we embrace each other. ... It’s a much more supportive approach.” That doesn’t mean they don’t care about law and order, Perry said, but “law and order and thoughtfulness can exist together.” Trump’s tone “is proving to not be what is going to win over Utahns,” he said, because what’s coming from Washington, D.C., “is not the approach that’s being taken right now in the state of Utah.” Longtime Utah Trump supporter Don Peay said he believes Trump’s approval ratings will go up in Utah as a result of his tough talk. “Of all places, Utah is one that understands law and order and the proper way to solve discrimination,” Peay said. “It is not through violence, destroying private and public property. And especially destroying the businesses of minority business owners who have worked their entire lives.” He said the Trump campaign helped to raise money to rebuild a small business in Minnesota, labeling that “action. Not talk.” Peay said that “Trump and all of us made it abundantly clear, the death of Mr. Floyd should have never happened and justice will be served.” The majority of Utahns “who take a moment to see beyond the media headlines will realize and appreciate Trump’s bold stand on law and order,” Peay said, especially since he believes “it didn’t affect Utah that much directly, though everyone I talk to hurts for our country to heal.” Scott Howell, a former state Senate minority leader and a key Utah supporter of former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Utahns don’t like what they’re seeing from Trump and his job approval will continue to fall in the state. “He’s his own worst enemy,” Howell said of Trump, citing the president’s posing for a photograph in front of a historic church near the White House that had been vandalized while holding a Bible, after authorities cleared peaceful protesters from an adjacent park using tear gas, flash-bang explosions and officers on horseback. “We’re a pretty compassionate state. We are,” Howell said, calling Trump’s actions disingenuous and an affront to many people of faith, particularly minorities. “I think it was a photo op. The prop was the Bible. You just had to watch it.” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who is not running for reelection after more than a decade in office, also fared well in the poll. Among all voters, 59% said they approved of the job Herbert is doing, while 28% disapprove and 13% aren’t sure. But among likely GOP primary voters, the governor’s approval ratings climb to 80%. Rasmussen said typically people “generally feel a little better about things closer to home.” But he said Utah’s governor, too, could see his job approval rating go up or down as a result of how he’s handled the protests in the state. The larger poll sample of 1,000 Utah registered voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, while the smaller sample of 494 likely primary voters in the state has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.",0.0

Would he grab a sign and square off against police? Write letters to politicians? Say prayers? The best answer is probably “all of the above,” according to leaders from various Christian traditions, who said faithful protesting comes in many forms. “Some people are called to be on the streets and some people aren’t. Some people are called to offer a supportive presence in one form or another, while others are just called to pray,” said Bishop Mariann Budde, who leads the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C. But no Christian is called to stay silent when people are suffering, she said. As the nation mourns George Floyd’s death in police custody, churches should be engaged with current protests over racial injustice and grappling with their own failures to love their black neighbors in the past, some religious leaders said. “The one thing Christians cannot do is to look away,” the Rev. Budde said. For much of American history, many predominately white churches did just that, according to Malcolm Foley, who serves as director of discipleship for Mosaic Church in Waco, Texas, and is currently writing a dissertation on lynching as he pursues a Ph.D. in Christian history. Some houses of worship thought it was wrong to worry about worldly concerns, so they refused to condemn slavery and other forms of racial violence. They wanted to keep their focus on God and the promise of salvation, not try to shake up the status quo. “They believed the church’s role is exclusively spiritual, which is often understood to be contrary to the physical world,” Foley said. To this day, some churches teach that faith-based activism violates the Bible’s call to respect worldly authority, said Daniel Darling, who has written about racial divisions within Christianity. Members worry that any form of protest would undermine the work of people in charge. “They focus on respect for the law and civil authority,” he said. From their founding onward, African American churches have taught that it’s possible to respect governing authorities and call for change at the same time, Foley said. They wanted to save souls, while also saving lives. “They believed that, if you’re in union with Christ, you should be using every single resource at your disposal” to build a better world, Foley said. “That’s going to include peaceful protest.” This impulse helps explain religious involvement in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which was led by several prominent black pastors, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. These leaders drew their inspiration from the Bible and described racial injustice as a sin. “They believed that salvation is not just something to look forward to. It’s something that we ought to be able to bring about and experience now,” Foley said. Over time, more and more Christians have embraced a worldview of working toward change, Darling said. It’s now common for churches to participate in marches tied to issues like abortion rights, climate change or sexual assault and encourage members to pay attention to what’s happening in the world outside the sanctuary’s walls. “As a Bible-believing Christian, I think you can’t read what the Bible says about human dignity and not apply it to our current system,” he said. Christians are called to be a “voice for the voiceless,” which means they should speak up on behalf of people whose pleas for justice aren’t being heard, said the Rev. Elizabeth McVicker, who leads two Methodist churches in Salt Lake City. “We’re called to bring a voice to injustice,” she said. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, most Christian denominations released statements expressing support for the activism taking place in his honor. “It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now. This time, we should not fail to hear what people are saying through their pain,” said Archbishop Jose Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a statement. President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints condemned racism and called upon all to foster human dignity in a social media post shared Monday. “The creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent!” he said. Many faith leaders also joined protests related to George Floyd’s death or hosted gatherings of their own. “We believe that people of faith need to be part of the work of healing,” said the Rev. McVicker, who co-hosted a peaceful protest in support of victims of police brutality on Tuesday night. Recent faith-based activism and statements on racial injustice have been a bright spot in a difficult time, Foley said. “The past few days and weeks have been encouraging in that sense. A number of folks seem to be coming to the realization that (racism) is a really big deal,” he said. They’re also realizing that part of living a life of faith means pitching in to help address it, Darling said. Christians “have a responsibility to participate in shaping our country,” he said. This responsibility can be fulfilled in many ways, as the Rev. Budde noted. Participating in elections, building a relationship with political officials and praying are all ways to shape the future that don’t involve picking up a protest sign. “A question we should all ask regularly is what would the love of Jesus look like in this moment? What would love do? What would sacrificially giving your life to someone else look like?” the Rev. Budde said. Questions like these can help Christians determine how and when to get involved in a protest movement and what types of activism will be most effective. Just this week, it led the Rev. Budde to go to St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is across the street from the White House, to offer comfort to protesters in the streets. “I thought we should be a respite station. We should be a place of hospitality and a place expressing solidarity with all of the protesters,” she said. “I wanted them to see the face of Jesus in us standing with them.” Other Christians might have taken a different approach, and that’s OK, the Rev. Budde said. There’s no one-size-fits-all way to bring God’s love to bear on difficult situations. However, religious leaders do agree that Christians should be committed to finding nonviolent solutions. The Bible teaches that vengeance and retribution are for God to dole out, Foley said. “We’ve been given a different call, a call to act in mercy,” he said. President Donald Trump seemed to reference this teaching during his June 1 remarks on recent protests, which he offered in the White House rose garden. He described violent protests as “domestic terror” and called on law enforcement to act quickly to stop rioting and looting. “The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,” Trump said. Although Foley might agree with this statement in another context, he said he was frustrated that the president did not put the same energy behind condemning racial violence and police brutality. Trump’s statement “glosses over the underlying issues,” Foley said. Christians need to be careful not to make the same mistake as they engage with efforts to root out race-based injustice. It’s possible to condemn looting and rioting and highlight the value of peaceful protest at the same time, Darling said. “You don’t want to deescalate things in order to go back to normal life. You still want that protest and you want change,” he said. Christians should be committed to fighting for justice no matter how long it takes to arrive, as Bishop Michael Curry, the first African American to serve as presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, said in a recent statement on activism. “Opening and changing hearts does not happen overnight. The Christian race is not a sprint; it is a marathon,” he said. Although recent violence is troubling, Christians shouldn’t use it as an excuse to avoid engaging with an important issue, Darling added. Efforts to address systemic racism will benefit from the strong moral leadership that people of faith can provide. “Whenever you have activism that loses its religious core, I think it can descend into the kind of things we’re seeing that we don’t like,” he said. And whenever religious communities lose site of their call to stand up against injustice, they can end up with a watered-down version of faith. “If you have a gospel that doesn’t force you to go out and try to change the culture because you love your neighbor and want a better world for him, then you have a truncated gospel,” Darling said.",0.0

I have seen beautiful, constructive behavior from protesters and from police officers who want nothing more than to see the world as a better place and are striving to do their part. I have seen the other end of the spectrum as well: emotions that have boiled over from lifetimes of not having your voice heard through peaceful action. This came out in many forms: mainly graffiti, hate speech, and destruction of public property. I have seen police escalate peaceful situations through instigating and intimidation, and I have seen police deescalate problematic protesters hellbent on instigating violence. Through it all, I can see that the majority of people on both sides want essentially the same thing; to find a solution to a problem that plagues our black community: systematic racism, and police brutality. These protests have brought the conversation to the forefront of our nation’s attention, and it is up to the people to stand up for what is right and be willing to see each other’s perspectives. Be open to changing not only our opinions and world views, but change the system so we can all have a fair shake. Misconceptions from both opposing viewpoints, and an unwillingness by a small portion of both parties to talk openly and with an open mind, keep us from this goal. The solution will never be black or white, but will be found as a grey tone somewhere in the middle — one that will take an extreme effort from our entire populace to find. I implore you to seek out positive solutions on whatever level you can, whether through the polls or by finding a way to use your talents to make the world a better place. Here are photos from my firsthand experience and interactions with Salt Lake City protesters and the Salt Lake City Police Department. I hope they help you move towards the middle so we can come to a permanent solution to systematic injustice. Editor’s note: The police-involved death of George Floyd sparked dozens of protests around the United States, including downtown Salt Lake City. Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died in police custody on May 25. Eyewitness video shows a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes before Floyd lost consciousness. Floyd was unarmed. Utah Against Police Brutality organized the May 30 protest, which initially started out peaceful. As the day progressed, several acts of vandalism occurred, including the burning of a Salt Lake City police vehicle.

Salt Lake City saw two protests — one near the State Capitol, which began Tuesday afternoon and stretched into the evening, and one at Washington Square, the home of the Salt Lake City-County Building. Both were impromptu and without official organization. While about 100 people lined the streets near the Capitol, about 300 marched around Washington Square for several hours, stopping for speeches and to interact with police and National Guard soldiers posted by the intersections. “We are here to unite, not fight,” said Hasson Davis, who addressed the crowd through a megaphone gathered at 400 South 200 East. “I am not an angry black man, but I am fed up.” Davis said the fear he feels is exhausting. “I feel like I have PTSD from watching this over and over,” said Davis, who called himself an activist, although he’s not affiliated with any organization. “I never caused harm to nobody, but I see the harm that was done. I have seen the bullet holes. I’ve seen people die. ... I don’t know what’s going to stop it.” The protests Tuesday night were not organized by a specific group, and people took turns speaking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. One of the more moving moments was when Davis offered his megaphone to a young woman who didn’t want to be identified, but who eloquently explained why the frustration that has boiled over will not recede any time soon. Black Americans, she said, are tired of being killed while jogging, while smoking, while sleeping, while sitting in their own homes, while playing in parks and walking through neighborhoods. Tory Quinn Crosby, who is with the Northern Utah Chapter of Black Lives Matter, attended the protest and asked the people of color from the crowd to join her in shaking hands with any police officer or soldier willing. She and others shook hands and talked briefly. “You guys have been amazing keeping it peaceful the last couple of days,” Crosby yelled through the megaphone. “I had to come out here. ... We are a powerful and strong movement, and we need to stick to that. These officers here are civilians just like us.” She got emotional as she talked about taking a knee with police and soldiers one street over just before she joined the protest. “We are not here to destroy our city,” Crosby said. At one point several people argued with her about whether or not begging police to kneel with them or shake their hands did any good. Crosby was adamant that connecting with officers and soldiers allowed them to see them as human beings — not stereotypes. “We want to be looked at like normal people. We just want humanity,” she said.

Utah Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson in turn tweeted his thanks Tuesday night to those who engaged in peaceful protests across the state. Thank you to those who engaged in peaceful protests around Salt Lake City, Provo, Orem and Logan today.  These issues require a dialogue and all of us working together. pic.twitter.com/dNU7I5XFLE — Commissioner Jess Anderson (@andersonljess) June 3, 2020 Also in Salt Lake City, a different group of protesters about a 100 strong initially lined each side of State Street leading up to the Capitol, chanting “if you think it’s a joke then you are not woke,” and “hands up don’t shoot.” Cheers arose from the protesters as drivers honked their horns as they cruised past. At one point the group marched around the Capitol’s grounds, clutching signs and continuing to cheer and chant. Among them was Mabel Bates, who said Tuesday was her third protest. “I’m here today to support people of color and use my white body as a barricade maybe if police officers decide to get violent,” Bates said. “I feel like with my white privilege comes a responsibility to protect my fellow human beings.” Police stood in a line at the front of the Capitol building’s steps, growing in number as the afternoon stretched on. The two groups largely did not interact with one another before 8 p.m., with the exception of several protesters who crossed the street to converse with officers. One woman sat nearby to sketch the protesters. Others passed out water bottles and masks to those congregating on either side of the street. Nolan Powe, who is black, said he lives in a predominately white town and has experienced racism and been racially profiled. “We really want to see a change in our system because black people are still getting racially profiled,” said Powe, who led chants outside the Capitol. “African Americans are still being racially profiled, especially in Utah. I guess me and the crowd would love it if we could get treated equally.” Powe plans to continue going to protests and spreading awareness. “I will not rest until George Floyd’s family gets justice and until either President (Donald) Trump condemns the act of the officers and makes right of it or until they simply put this to bed,” he said. The crowd dispersed peacefully at about 8:10 p.m. when police crossed the street and told them they needed to leave for the night because of Salt Lake City’s curfew, put in place this week following destructive riots over the weekend. Before leaving, protesters called for the officers to take a knee with them, their cries intensifying as police crossed the street. A peaceful group also assembled in Logan. In Ogden, about 20 teens and young adults held signs near City Hall on the corner of 25th and Washington Boulevard Tuesday afternoon, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “no justice, no peace.” Several drivers honked their horns and raised their fists in solidarity as they passed. According to Sierra Rose, one of the organizers, the youth wanted their protest to be peaceful, so she was encouraging participants to disengage with anyone who tried to antagonize them. Rose said she attended a rally on Sunday that was met with vitriol by passersby. The group saw opposition Tuesday, but protesters instead turned their attention to chanting or cheering. Rose said she doesn’t want their message of justice for Floyd and solidarity within her community to be lost in the screaming and fighting that can happen at protests. The group of protesters ranged in age from 15 to 21. Rose said teens are often excluded from these movements because people think they only show up to take pictures for their social media. Brevan Benard, another organizer, echoed what Rose said, saying he wanted to protest peacefully and give a voice to the youth in the community who were frustrated with policing too. “We believe in change; we came here to motivate and inspire people to not just protest, but to come and do it peacefully,” he said. “We as kids are the next generation.” In Orem, passersby swelled the ranks of what began as a small, honk-and-wave-style protest on the corners of State Street and University Parkway near the University Place Mall. Four men in their 20s said they had been driving around Provo and Orem with signs in their car, looking to join a protest. Juliana Cassiano, 30, of Provo, led call-and-response chants on one corner, yelling “Whose lives matter? Black lives matter!” and “I can’t breath!” “This is a remarkable moment when people have decided to talk about this issue all over the country, so we have a responsibility to educate people about how we’ve lived with so many years of injustice. This is a great moment.” Grid View Protesters demonstrate peacefully as they walk towards police on 200 East between 400 South and 500 South in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 2, 2020.

The protesters joined others across the nation to decry the death of George Floyd, a black man, who died while being taken into custody by police in Minneapolis last week. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The protest’s organizer was a 21-year-old Utah Valley University student who gave only her first name, Natasha. She stood on one corner alone at 1:30 p.m., but by 7 p.m. there were more than 70 people carrying signs in the crosswalks and yelling on all four corners. She told each person who joined they had to be civil, lawful and nonviolent. “The people here realize there is a serious injustice happening and a need for reform,” she said. “We’re all standing here in solidarity for George Floyd and for all other victims of police brutality and white supremacy who have gotten no justice.” Hundreds of cars honked in support of the protest, fueled by signs like “Honk if black lives matter.” One man yelled, “Trump 2020” at the protesters from his car in a left turn lane, then flipped them off as he drove past. A verbal skirmish broke out when Hayden Hansen and his father, Tyler, who are white, walked over from Texas Roadhouse and told some of the white protesters that all lives matter. “In my opinion, their lives do matter, but mine matters just as much,” said Hayden Hansen, who would like to be a police officer. The father and son were frustrated when a couple of protesters told them to leave. “We weren’t for (George Floyd) getting killed,” Tyler Hansen said. “I thought that was savage, but these protesters need to know the statistics; cops kill more white men than black men.” Asked if that held true based on the percentage of people of those races in the U.S. population, Hansen said he would look it up. Police encouraged people to go home and leave the city streets at curfew, but they didn’t begin actively enforcing it until about 9 p.m. About 50 people continued protesting, walking partway to the Capitol before turning around and heading south on State Street. Police blocked off streets as they marched in north bound lanes and adjacent sidewalks.",0.0

Based on Tuesday’s discussions, the Salt Lake City Council seemed willing and eager to pump more money into anti-police brutality initiatives, including increased de-escalation training, bias training, and funding to ensure every police officer has a body camera — though no decisions were made. But later Tuesday, the council faced a barrage of demands in its public meeting, where more than 80 Salt Lake City residents called in to the online meeting demanding major cuts to the Salt Lake City Police Department’s budget while more money goes to affordable housing, homelessness, public transportation for minority groups, and other programs to address “systematic racism.” Michael Kennedy-Yoon told the City Council he was at one of the Salt Lake City protests this week, and he saw a police officer yelling back at a 15-year-old girl protester, “screaming back words that would get him kicked out of a committee meeting.” “I used to believe police officers were heroes,” Kennedy-Yoon said. “I think that’s been demonstrated to me severely over the last week that that’s not true. If you want to become a hero, you become an EMT, you become a firefighter, you become a school teacher, you do not become a police officer. If you want to become a bully, you become a police officer. I’m morally opposed to funding a bully.” Yoon and other callers demanded city leaders implement a “hiring freeze” of police officers and slash the department’s budget, rather than fund it with the over $80 million proposed in the mayor’s budget for the police department. But the budget increase would be used to pay for victim advocates, additional de-escalation bias training, and salary increases the city is already obligated to fulfill under previously executed contracts, according to city officials. Public commenters also slammed Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall’s weeklong nighttime curfew announced Monday, complaining the 8 p.m. curfew each night is “heavy-handed.” Some groups, like Utah’s chapter of the ACLU, have also challenged its constitutionality, saying it raises First Amendment and fairness concerns, in part because it allows some activities to take place in public but not others. Because the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. order is citywide, it could lead to selective enforcement in certain neighborhoods, said ACLU of Utah legal director John Mejia. And those in more diverse enclaves may not have a grasp of various exceptions. “There’s a lack of clarity in general, but I think that’s compounded when you have people who don’t necessarily speak English,” he said. “I think it’s causing a lot of anxiety and fear among people.” The mayor’s Monday order allows for activities like going out to attend religious services, traveling to the airport or dining at a restaurant during curfew hours, but does not carve out any free-speech exception. “That’s problematic,” Mejia said. While other cities across the nation have put in place indefinite curfews, Mejia said it appears Salt Lake City’s has more exceptions than most. But the mayor defended the curfew, saying it balances First Amendment rights while protecting residents and neighborhoods by keeping protests at manageable levels. “We would love to see peaceful protest continuing and not people coming with loaded weapons to these protests, people not firing weapons as we had last night,” Mendenhall told the council earlier Tuesday. “If we see that kind of a change and, in assessing the national climate and local intelligence, we would love to not have a curfew. ... We want to get there.” Mendenhall stressed she and other city officials have ears wide open for productive conversations about addressing police brutality and systematic racism. “We hear you. We want to work. We are ready to work,” she said. “There is not a switch that needs to get flipped here. We’re here.” The mayor, however, also acknowledged the protests in Salt Lake City and around the country “is a national conversation.” “I understand that,” she said, “but Salt Lake City is ready to work.” Some Salt Lake City Council members, tuning into Tuesday’s online meeting from their home offices, showed their support for anti-police brutality groups, with some posting signs reading “Black Lives Matter” behind their seats. Salt Lake City Councilwoman Ana Valdemoros, the city’s first woman of color elected to the council, read a lengthy statement expressing her support for the movement, but she also urged for protests to be peaceful. “The overwhelming majority of us, including the many good police officers of our city, are united against police brutality against our black neighbors,” Valdemoros said. “Thank you to our police department for their effort in keeping people safe these last few days and especially thank you to those officers that joined the crowd, kneeling or bumping elbows, showing compassion, showing that they too believe in justice and decry injustice in the hands of some their colleagues, especially after the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd.” Valdemoros said she ran for office because “I believe we can work on solutions towards justice and equality.” “I strongly reject attempts to make me choose a side or politicize this issue,” she said. “Demanding that we pick a side is a big reason why we are in this mess. There are no sides. It’s not an either or proposition. It is not ‘us versus them.’ It is just us.” Valdemoros said she’s “committed to ending those antiquated systems and processes that result in discrimination and racism.” “It is 2020. We should be so much further along,” she said. As council members discussed the protests and sought ways to focus on improving Salt Lake City’s own police department, a police department that has won national awards for de-escalation practices, answers didn’t come easily. The city’s police department already prohibits choke holds and knee holds. And the department already gets de-escalation training and implicit bias training. Salt Lake Police Assistant Chief Tim Doubt, asked by Council Chairman Chris Wharton what the police department would need to improve, welcomed any additional training. “We’re going to find out what the next best thing is to teach our people, which I’m sure is going to come out of this whole thing nationwide, some kind of best practices,” he said. “We’re going to find out what those are and we’re going to have to get our people trained on them.” Doubt also said more work could be done to hire more officers representing minority groups — but that’s difficult when it’s already challenging to recruit enough officers as is. “It ought to match the demographics of Utah, and it doesn’t,” Doubt said. “And so we need to make sure that does, and we’re striving to do that.” Most of all, Doubt said community relationships and recruitment improve if police officers have the time and resources to spend time in the community — which has become more possible as the City Council has increased funding in recent years to bring the police force to higher staffing levels, he said. “They now have time to do that,” he said. Additionally, Doubt said measures are already in place to hold the police department accountable. But the Civilian Review Board isn’t always fully staffed because the city can’t find enough people who want to take part. And the police department’s Community Advocacy Group, an informal group of citizens formed to give input on police policies, has varying participation. “Sometimes we come, and there’s only four to five people there, but other times there’s 50,” Doubt said. “So it’s just a matter of keeping people involved and trying to keep a constant voice.” Also, Doubt said he “wished” every Salt Lake City cop had a body camera, but “that was not affordable under the current contract we were negotiating.” The Salt Lake City Council is slated to consider a budget amendment next week, which could include some changes to the police department’s budget, but no details were hashed out Tuesday. The council’s meeting stretched late into the night, as over 80 public speakers urged action on police reform, many repeating the same demands to slash the department’s budget and instead fund priorities to help minority populations. As of 9:45 p.m., over 200 people were sitting on the call waiting to speak. Contributing: Annie Knox",0.0

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops — waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases — after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. Article continues below The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”   Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

Administrators had placed tenured criminal justice professor Scott Senjo on administrative leave to conduct a review. The tweets were posted on his personal Twitter account. In an email sent to his department chairman and college dean on Wednesday, Senjo wrote: “I studied the situation and the public fury is too great. I have to resign immediately. There’s no other option.” In a statement, the university said it did not ask for his resignation. But in a subsequent email to media outlets, Senjo said he was ordered to resign his position due to his “irresponsible tweeting activity over the last several months. “I agree that my tweets were far beyond the realm of acceptable university policy as well as acceptable social norms. I made those tweets in the oftentimes vulgar, extreme back-and-forth that can occur on Twitter and they were simply wrong. I apologize for my irresponsible behavior and resign my position, effective immediately.” Meanwhile, WSU’s statement said: “The Twitter posts in question were hurtful and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University and our work to create an inclusive and welcoming environment. We know the views expressed in these tweets make many of our students and members of our campus community feel isolated or unsupported,” WSU’s statement says. “We appreciate the outpouring of emails and social media posts from our students, alumni and colleagues who shared their concerns. We remain committed to creating a campus environment where all are welcome, heard, valued and supported.” Senjo’s tweets were earlier described by university officials as “abhorrent” and inconsistent with the university’s values. Senjo, who taught at Weber State University for 20 years, acknowledged he is responsible for the tweets, “but I don’t stand by them and will have to suffer the consequences of my recklessness,” he told the Deseret News late Tuesday. “I made those tweets in the sordid atmosphere of Twitter knife fights where sarcastic put downs and tasteless humor are often the norm. I failed to respect my role as a college professor in the hyper-emotional atmosphere of the recent police brutality protests. I apologize for my Twitter contributions. In the aggregate, they reflect a great deal of ugliness,” he wrote. The professor posted provocative tweets commenting on protests and news media in the aftermath of the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25. Some tweets were aimed at news organizations or journalists. Responding to a tweet by Wall Street Journal reporter Tyler Blint-Welsh, who tweeted his ankle was injured and glasses knocked off when he was reportedly struck in the face by New York City police multiple times with riot shields despite wearing a press credential and holding his hands up, Senjo tweeted: “Excellent. If I was the cop, you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” In another tweet, @ProfSenjo referred to protesters vandalizing the CNN building in Atlanta, saying: “Nothing about this makes me happy but there’s this tiny sense of rightness in the burning of the CNN headquarters.” Still another addressed a widely viewed video of New York Police Department vehicles that plowed into a crowd of protesters. The tweet said: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” The account no longer exists. More than 2,300 people had signed an online petition calling for Senjo’s ouster. A Change.org petition posted Sunday says in part: “His tweets go against freedom of speech and diversity of opinion as he is pushing for violence against press, as well as people of color. Criminal justice students at Weber deserve better. Students of color at Weber deserve better. This is a call for Weber State University to do better and be better by firing Scott Senjo.” Senjo holds a number of advanced degrees, including a doctorate from Florida Atlantic University and a law degree and master’s degree in public policy and administration from the University of Utah. He earned his undergraduate degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. An earlier statement by Weber State University President Brad Mortensen said in part that the university stands “with peaceful protesters in Ogden and across the globe and call for change: an end to racism, an end to oppression and intolerance, an end to violence. I call upon all members of our campus community to join me in pursuing a calm, respectful, yet urgent path.”",0.0

Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. Article continues below The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”   Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

LOGAN — The chief of the Logan City Police Department issued a statement on behalf of his officers in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The statement came as the latest rash of anger has been directed at law enforcement members throughout the country, including rallies around the state. Chief Gary Jensen said his officers and staff have also been saddened and angered by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s actions. Watching the video of Floyd’s death has incensed him and everyone else in the department. “That video hurt me personally and hurt me professionally, to watch that happen,” said Jensen. The department trains officers several times per year regarding all aspects of police response to different types of service calls, from traffic stops to domestic violence. They train on implicit stereotyping, crisis intervention, de-escalation techniques, mental health intervention and appropriate uses of force. Jensen explained how his administration reviews weekly all use-of-force incidents if any have occurred. That includes evaluating body camera and in-car video. They assess the officer’s ability to listen, show compassion, while at the same time being firm in dealing with crime or criminality. “We know each of these officers individually. We know who they are. We know what makes them tick, personally and professionally. We watch them and I have a reverence for how they do their job. As I watch these use-of-force videos, it proves to me better everyday that these officers have the best interest of everybody they deal with.” The chief’s comments came the same day a group of individuals gathered at the Historic Cache County Courthouse to hold a “Black Lives Matter” protest. The group held signs and waived to motorists driving along Main St. Jensen said when he learned about the group, he and Assistant Chief Jeff Simmons loaded up a cooler of drinks and pizzas to give to them. He admitted that there was a little apprehension at first, as they approached the group and offered them the food. “When they watched us get out with pizzas, drinks and engage them with elbow bumps and conversation, it was great. It was what I needed and quite frankly I think it was what they needed. Those kinds of things speak volumes when you’re trying to do good things to make this situation heal.” Recently, the police department has also dealt with an increase of scrutiny, as people questioned the hiring of Officer Miguel Deras. The former University of Utah officer allegedly kept explicit photos of Lauren McCluskey on his cellphone and bragged about it, prior to her murder. An investigation into the allegations has been launched. Jensen once again praised the citizens of Logan and expressed hope that he and his officers can continue to merit the trust of the community. He said the department is made better by the citizens that make up the community. “Obviously, I would like to be trusted. We have to everyday continue to earn that trust and not step outside the lines. We recognize that.” Jensen hopes the past week will help law enforcement and citizens be able to come together and better understand the difficulties each other face. will@cvradio.com",0.0

Tang also led the crowd in chanting “No justice. No peace.

A crowd of mostly white people remembered Floyd, the black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered demonstrations across the U.S. But it was an Asian American teen who delivered some of the most memorable words on Monday at the Park City High School field. Emma Tang, an 18-year-old who lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, attended high school in Park City for her freshman and sophomore years, returning to the Kearns Boulevard campus on Monday to offer remarks from the perspective of a minority person. Many in the crowd of upward of 300 people appeared captivated as Tang spoke, sometimes using aggressive words. She told the crowd that not being a racist is not enough, that silence by white people amounts to violence and said police officers are racist. Support Local Journalism Donate  “We need your anger all the time, because change starts and ends with you,” she told the crowd. She also led the crowd in chanting “No justice. No peace. No racist police.” Tang rallied on Monday carrying a sign that said “Yellow Peril for Black Power,” using a message with racial undertones dating to prejudiced worries from long ago about the rise of Asians. In interviews afterward, Tang, who graduated from high school in Colorado and plans to attend New York University later this year, said there is “indifference towards racism.” “When I went to school here, I actually faced a lot of anti-Asian sentiments from a lot of my classmates. So, it’s interesting to see how they’ve evolved, which is really good,” Tang said. “But I would say that a lot of white students, not just here but kind of across the nation, aren’t really affected by the racism, so they don’t really feel the need to combat it, I guess. So, I guess, if it’s not called out to them, they don’t necessarily pay attention.” She described the racism she saw while a student in Park City as “micro-aggression rather than outward acts.” Tang said she wants people who attended the event on Monday to better recognize racism and respond. “I think I would really like to see them call out racism in their own personal lives . . . when they see comments, when they see their classmates and their friends and their family doing or saying something that may not even be outwardly racist, but just calling that out. And then really internally checking themselves,” she said.",0.0

The Aggies joined the “Blackout Tuesday” movement on Tuesday, June 2. Utah State’s official Twitter accounts for the school’s athletics department, football team, men’s basketball team, track and field team, and cross country team each shared posts on social media in support. The Aggies participated in Blackout Tuesday, a movement created to amplify the voices of black people on social media.

Organizers and creators are reminding people not to use #blacklivesmatter, as that hashtag is reserved to share information regarding the movement. The death of George Floyd and the nationwide protests spurred the movement. Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a Minnesota police officer. The officer – who has now been fired and arrested – held his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes on May 25, 2020. The officer involved has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The movement was started by record executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agymang, according to Variety magazine.

Salt Lake City saw two protests — one near the State Capitol, which began Tuesday afternoon and stretched into the evening, and one at Washington Square, the home of the Salt Lake City-County Building. Both were impromptu and without official organization. While about 100 people lined the streets near the Capitol, about 300 marched around Washington Square for several hours, stopping for speeches and to interact with police and National Guard soldiers posted by the intersections. “We are here to unite, not fight,” said Hasson Davis, who addressed the crowd through a megaphone gathered at 400 South 200 East. “I am not an angry black man, but I am fed up.” Davis said the fear he feels is exhausting. “I feel like I have PTSD from watching this over and over,” said Davis, who called himself an activist, although he’s not affiliated with any organization. “I never caused harm to nobody, but I see the harm that was done. I have seen the bullet holes. I’ve seen people die. ... I don’t know what’s going to stop it.” The protests Tuesday night were not organized by a specific group, and people took turns speaking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. One of the more moving moments was when Davis offered his megaphone to a young woman who didn’t want to be identified, but who eloquently explained why the frustration that has boiled over will not recede any time soon. Black Americans, she said, are tired of being killed while jogging, while smoking, while sleeping, while sitting in their own homes, while playing in parks and walking through neighborhoods. Tory Quinn Crosby, who is with the Northern Utah Chapter of Black Lives Matter, attended the protest and asked the people of color from the crowd to join her in shaking hands with any police officer or soldier willing. She and others shook hands and talked briefly. “You guys have been amazing keeping it peaceful the last couple of days,” Crosby yelled through the megaphone. “I had to come out here. ... We are a powerful and strong movement, and we need to stick to that. These officers here are civilians just like us.” She got emotional as she talked about taking a knee with police and soldiers one street over just before she joined the protest. “We are not here to destroy our city,” Crosby said. At one point several people argued with her about whether or not begging police to kneel with them or shake their hands did any good. Crosby was adamant that connecting with officers and soldiers allowed them to see them as human beings — not stereotypes. “We want to be looked at like normal people. We just want humanity,” she said.

Utah Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson in turn tweeted his thanks Tuesday night to those who engaged in peaceful protests across the state.

These issues require a dialogue and all of us working together. pic.twitter.com/dNU7I5XFLE — Commissioner Jess Anderson (@andersonljess) June 3, 2020 Also in Salt Lake City, a different group of protesters about a 100 strong initially lined each side of State Street leading up to the Capitol, chanting “if you think it’s a joke then you are not woke,” and “hands up don’t shoot.” Cheers arose from the protesters as drivers honked their horns as they cruised past. At one point the group marched around the Capitol’s grounds, clutching signs and continuing to cheer and chant. Among them was Mabel Bates, who said Tuesday was her third protest. “I’m here today to support people of color and use my white body as a barricade maybe if police officers decide to get violent,” Bates said. “I feel like with my white privilege comes a responsibility to protect my fellow human beings.” Police stood in a line at the front of the Capitol building’s steps, growing in number as the afternoon stretched on. The two groups largely did not interact with one another before 8 p.m., with the exception of several protesters who crossed the street to converse with officers. One woman sat nearby to sketch the protesters. Others passed out water bottles and masks to those congregating on either side of the street. Nolan Powe, who is black, said he lives in a predominately white town and has experienced racism and been racially profiled. “We really want to see a change in our system because black people are still getting racially profiled,” said Powe, who led chants outside the Capitol. “African Americans are still being racially profiled, especially in Utah. I guess me and the crowd would love it if we could get treated equally.” Powe plans to continue going to protests and spreading awareness. “I will not rest until George Floyd’s family gets justice and until either President (Donald) Trump condemns the act of the officers and makes right of it or until they simply put this to bed,” he said. The crowd dispersed peacefully at about 8:10 p.m. when police crossed the street and told them they needed to leave for the night because of Salt Lake City’s curfew, put in place this week following destructive riots over the weekend. Before leaving, protesters called for the officers to take a knee with them, their cries intensifying as police crossed the street. A peaceful group also assembled in Logan. In Ogden, about 20 teens and young adults held signs near City Hall on the corner of 25th and Washington Boulevard Tuesday afternoon, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “no justice, no peace.” Several drivers honked their horns and raised their fists in solidarity as they passed. According to Sierra Rose, one of the organizers, the youth wanted their protest to be peaceful, so she was encouraging participants to disengage with anyone who tried to antagonize them. Rose said she attended a rally on Sunday that was met with vitriol by passersby. The group saw opposition Tuesday, but protesters instead turned their attention to chanting or cheering. Rose said she doesn’t want their message of justice for Floyd and solidarity within her community to be lost in the screaming and fighting that can happen at protests. The group of protesters ranged in age from 15 to 21. Rose said teens are often excluded from these movements because people think they only show up to take pictures for their social media. Brevan Benard, another organizer, echoed what Rose said, saying he wanted to protest peacefully and give a voice to the youth in the community who were frustrated with policing too. “We believe in change; we came here to motivate and inspire people to not just protest, but to come and do it peacefully,” he said. “We as kids are the next generation.” In Orem, passersby swelled the ranks of what began as a small, honk-and-wave-style protest on the corners of State Street and University Parkway near the University Place Mall. Four men in their 20s said they had been driving around Provo and Orem with signs in their car, looking to join a protest. Juliana Cassiano, 30, of Provo, led call-and-response chants on one corner, yelling “Whose lives matter? Black lives matter!” and “I can’t breath!” “This is a remarkable moment when people have decided to talk about this issue all over the country, so we have a responsibility to educate people about how we’ve lived with so many years of injustice. This is a great moment.” Grid View Protesters demonstrate peacefully as they walk towards police on 200 East between 400 South and 500 South in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 2, 2020.

The protesters joined others across the nation to decry the death of George Floyd, a black man, who died while being taken into custody by police in Minneapolis last week. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The protest’s organizer was a 21-year-old Utah Valley University student who gave only her first name, Natasha. She stood on one corner alone at 1:30 p.m., but by 7 p.m. there were more than 70 people carrying signs in the crosswalks and yelling on all four corners. She told each person who joined they had to be civil, lawful and nonviolent. “The people here realize there is a serious injustice happening and a need for reform,” she said. “We’re all standing here in solidarity for George Floyd and for all other victims of police brutality and white supremacy who have gotten no justice.” Hundreds of cars honked in support of the protest, fueled by signs like “Honk if black lives matter.” One man yelled, “Trump 2020” at the protesters from his car in a left turn lane, then flipped them off as he drove past. A verbal skirmish broke out when Hayden Hansen and his father, Tyler, who are white, walked over from Texas Roadhouse and told some of the white protesters that all lives matter. “In my opinion, their lives do matter, but mine matters just as much,” said Hayden Hansen, who would like to be a police officer. The father and son were frustrated when a couple of protesters told them to leave. “We weren’t for (George Floyd) getting killed,” Tyler Hansen said. “I thought that was savage, but these protesters need to know the statistics; cops kill more white men than black men.” Asked if that held true based on the percentage of people of those races in the U.S. population, Hansen said he would look it up. Police encouraged people to go home and leave the city streets at curfew, but they didn’t begin actively enforcing it until about 9 p.m. About 50 people continued protesting, walking partway to the Capitol before turning around and heading south on State Street.

She also wanted to “pop that bubble” surrounding Utah residents and make them aware of issues the black community faces regularly. “You can’t run away from it. You can’t change the channel,” she said. “You have to acknowledge that there’s injustice going on, and if you’re not outwardly speaking against it, then you’re in compliance and you’re allowing it to perpetuate.” A protester holds up a sign at an Orem, Utah, protest June 2. (Preston Crawley) Cadet said she believes Utah County residents have good intentions but called on them to speak up and publicly condemn racism rather than support silently from the sidelines. Protester Pizairia Warren added that people can make their views harder to ignore or dismiss by showing up to protests instead of just posting on social media. “By being out here and holding up this sign and showing my face, it puts more behind the movement than just words,” she said. “When you can see me, you can see that I’m hurting. You can see that there’s a human behind these posters, behind these hashtags, behind these statistics.” Warren, too, encouraged Utah County residents to stand in solidarity with the black community and other marginalized people. The Black Lives Matter movement, she said, does not negate the fact that all lives matter but focuses the conversation on a community that has been targeted and wants to feel safe. “We want that for everyone. We want that for the Hispanics who are locked in cages right now. We want that for the gay people who feel like a hate crime might be committed against them because they show who they truly are,” Warren said. “We want it for everyone, not just for black people, but this is where we start because this is one of the most prominent problems in today’s America.” Both Cadet and Warren called for justice for black people and others who have been harmed by police brutality or prejudice in the criminal justice system. Protester and veteran Thomas Durham expressed the hope that more police officers would eventually show support for protesters. “The face that I can just kind of be gunned down in my own home is wrong on every level.” A protester displays her sign at University Parkway and State Street in Orem June 2. (Preston Crawley) Several people who didn’t have time to stand on the street corner showed their support by dropping off water bottles and snacks for the protesters. Others honked their horns and waved at protesters as they drove by. Protester Ben Thomas said, as a white person, he felt the need to protest because injustice in the police system negatively affects everyone. “An instance of brutality against a black person, against any minority in general, is an instance of brutality against all Americans and against all people,” he said. “All of us deserve to be treated with dignity and respect when it comes to police interactions.” He said he hopes this and other protests send the message that young people expect meaningful change in the American police system. Cadet encouraged the many college students living in Utah County to use their voices to call for change and reminded them that injustice is not just a black issue, but a human issue. “In the history books, what side of the story do you want to be on?” she said.",0.0

The poll found that 52% of Utahns like what they’re seeing from the Republican in the White House, while 46% disapprove of the president’s job performance. Just 2% said they weren’t sure how they feel. Trump’s job approval in Utah had reached as high as 57% in March and April. But among a smaller group of likely Republican voters in Utah’s June 30 state primary, the president’s job approval rating jumps to 81%, with just 18% disapproval and only 1% uncertain. Trump easily won Utah’s March 3 presidential primary with nearly 88% of the GOP vote. The poll was conducted by independent pollster Scott Rasmussen for the Deseret News and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics, starting on May 25, the day George Floyd died as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, and ending Sunday, the day after a Salt Lake City protest turned violent. Rasmussen said he believes it’s too soon to say how Utahns will view the president’s response. “It’s pretty unsettled out there right now. So I think maybe you captured a little bit of it,” he said, comparing today’s turmoil to the 1960s when President Richard Nixon declared himself a law-and-order president amid anti-war protests and race riots, just as Trump did Monday when he threatened to deploy U.S. troops to quell unrest. “The parallels are a little bit uncomfortable and very, very unpredictable,” Rasmussen said. At this point, he said the slight decline in the president’s job approval in Utah is likely related more to how he’s handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Hinckley Institute Director Jason Perry said Utahns have been busy sorting out their own feelings toward the situation, especially after Saturday’s protest in downtown Salt Lake City where two cars were burned and both public and private property was vandalized. “There will be Utahns who disapprove of the president’s actions but mostly they’re going to be focused on how our local leaders have approached these protests,” Perry said. “Utahns over the last couple of days have had a chance to look at their own thoughts and feelings about the protests.” He said Utahns have come to the conclusion they want “compassion. They’ve been wanting people to be thoughtful about their approach, and this to be one of the opportunities where we embrace each other. ... It’s a much more supportive approach.” That doesn’t mean they don’t care about law and order, Perry said, but “law and order and thoughtfulness can exist together.” Trump’s tone “is proving to not be what is going to win over Utahns,” he said, because what’s coming from Washington, D.C., “is not the approach that’s being taken right now in the state of Utah.” Longtime Utah Trump supporter Don Peay said he believes Trump’s approval ratings will go up in Utah as a result of his tough talk. “Of all places, Utah is one that understands law and order and the proper way to solve discrimination,” Peay said. “It is not through violence, destroying private and public property. And especially destroying the businesses of minority business owners who have worked their entire lives.” He said the Trump campaign helped to raise money to rebuild a small business in Minnesota, labeling that “action. Not talk.” Peay said that “Trump and all of us made it abundantly clear, the death of Mr. Floyd should have never happened and justice will be served.” The majority of Utahns “who take a moment to see beyond the media headlines will realize and appreciate Trump’s bold stand on law and order,” Peay said, especially since he believes “it didn’t affect Utah that much directly, though everyone I talk to hurts for our country to heal.” Scott Howell, a former state Senate minority leader and a key Utah supporter of former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said Utahns don’t like what they’re seeing from Trump and his job approval will continue to fall in the state. “He’s his own worst enemy,” Howell said of Trump, citing the president’s posing for a photograph in front of a historic church near the White House that had been vandalized while holding a Bible, after authorities cleared peaceful protesters from an adjacent park using tear gas, flash-bang explosions and officers on horseback. “We’re a pretty compassionate state. We are,” Howell said, calling Trump’s actions disingenuous and an affront to many people of faith, particularly minorities. “I think it was a photo op. The prop was the Bible. You just had to watch it.” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who is not running for reelection after more than a decade in office, also fared well in the poll. Among all voters, 59% said they approved of the job Herbert is doing, while 28% disapprove and 13% aren’t sure. But among likely GOP primary voters, the governor’s approval ratings climb to 80%. Rasmussen said typically people “generally feel a little better about things closer to home.” But he said Utah’s governor, too, could see his job approval rating go up or down as a result of how he’s handled the protests in the state. The larger poll sample of 1,000 Utah registered voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, while the smaller sample of 494 likely primary voters in the state has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.",0.0

Attendees gathered to protest police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Tanzi Propst/Park Record More photos from the demonstration are available here. A Park City crowd gathered on the sun-soaked turf of Dozier Field midday on Monday in tribute to George Floyd, the black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered widespread protests in the U.S., showing solidarity with those who are outraged during a peaceful demonstration that urged the crowd to speak out against racism, highlighted the civil rights movement and spoke of America as one nation. The majority of the people at the gathering were white. There was a mix of ages that ranged from teens to senior citizens. Elected officials like Mayor Andy Beerman joined the demonstration, but it appeared that the crowd was made up mostly of everyday Parkites. The crowd spread out across a portion of the football field in what was the first major demonstration in Park City since social distancing guidelines were implemented in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Park City High School students organized the event and were some of the featured speakers. The crowd early on kneeled on the football field for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, marking the time a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck. It was an especially poignant moment during the demonstration as the people silently kept their knee on the turf. Some gripped signs with messages like “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breathe.” Support Local Journalism Donate  As part of the rally, demonstrators knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held his knee against Floyd’s throat. Sandra Hollins, a black state legislator from Salt Lake City, delivered some of the most notable comments of the event, speaking to the crowd about civil rights-era figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. She described the situation in the nation as “pent-up pain unleashed.” “Do not fight hate with hate,” she said. Hollins said much progress has been made since segregation but more work is needed. She spoke about the importance of voting and said voting laws unfairly target black people and others. Hollins said communities of color experience pain daily and said there is outrage with another black man killed by the police. “They fear the power of your vote,” she said. Hollins also urged young people to become involved rather than limiting their participation to using social media and said young people were on the front lines of the civil rights era. “Use your privilege to disrupt the system,” Hollins said. The event on Monday was initially planned as a march on Main Street to City Park followed by a rally. The venue was changed to Dozier Field on the grounds of Park City High School shortly after the announcement that an event would be held. There were fewer logistical challenges at Dozier Field than there would have been on Main Street and on the route to City Park for an event that was planned over the course of just several days. The organizers sought a peaceful protest and, before it was shifted to Dozier Field, urged people not to loot, riot, paint graffiti or engage in violent acts. The Park City Police Department observed the demonstration. No incidents were reported. The organizers said upward of 300 people attended. Lance Rothchild, a junior at the high school and one of the organizers, said in an interview afterward the event was successful in raising awareness and inspiring people to act. “The ultimate goal is to completely get rid of systemic racism and police brutality,” he said, adding, “We did what we could to help.”",0.0

At first, the demonstration was small, with only a few people. However, the crowd grew as others saw the signs or heard about the protest through social media. By evening, there were more than 100 protestors outside the courthouse. Jackson was hopeful the demonstration could help others avoid the experiences she has witnessed in her life as a black person. One example included a personal witness of what she said was a race-related killing of a black man by a police officer. “I don’t want anybody else to go through that,” she said. “I don’t want any more black people to have to worry about being on the streets, worrying about walking down the streets, worrying about being in the mall getting followed and for the cops to show up and arrest them for no reason or murder them like George Floyd, like Breonna Taylor, like Trayvon Martin.” The protest comes with many others that have arisen nationally following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on May 25, when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. Protestors received some support from local businesses and community members throughout the day, including the Logan City Police Department. “People have been really peaceful and dropping us off water and food all day,” Branden Haun, a Cache Valley resident and protestor said. “The police department came by earlier. They had a cooler full of cold drinks. They brought us, like, 10 pizzas.” Haun said that, while his father worked as a correctional officer and his stepmother worked for dispatch for 20 years, he felt the need to speak up about recent events involving police. “There just comes a certain point where you just see stuff get out of hand and you’ve got to say something,” Haun said. Protestors said a few people tried to argue or yelled at them. A few diesel truck drivers left them in puffs of dark smoke but the demonstration was peaceful overall. Susan Jelus, a Newton resident, protested by using a megaphone to lead the group in chants. She organizes the yearly Women’s March in Logan, and also helped plan today’s protest before it was initially cancelled due to concerns about COVID-19. When she heard that people were showing up anyway, she decided to participate. “There is a lot of support from the street,” Jelus said. “Often there is, but this is more support from the street than I’ve seen for any other rally.” Passing cars have been honking in support throughout the day pic.twitter.com/YKkAExbIGT — Utah Statesman 📰 (@UtahStatesman) June 3, 2020 As the night approached, the protestors walked along the sidewalks of Main Street and past the police station. After returning to the courthouse, Logan City councilmember Jess Bradfield met the demonstrators and talked about what reforms the city could implement. Utah State University students were present for the protest, including Tomoya Averett, a global communications major. She said she came to support because she is black and she also wanted to support her community. “I like to see the Logan community come together. So, I wanted to come out here and support fellow black students and just feel loved and supported by my community,” Averett said. Jackson plans to host another protest including speakers, music and food on Saturday at 11 a.m. at the same location. She said she was impressed with today’s turnout. “I just didn’t expect this from Logan because of how much racism I’ve seen here, and for them to all come out here like this and in this big of a group,” Jackson said. “I know it looks small, but this is really big for it to be Logan. I’m just really proud of Logan.” Haun said he hoped Tuesday’s protest conveyed positivity and love. “Spread love, not hate. Hate breeds hate. So if we want to do something, we’ve got to make sure we’re showing love and being positive about it all and get out there and vote,” Haun said. —alek.nelson@aggiemail.usu.edu @nelsonalek Gallery:",0.0

Gallery | 10 Photos (Ivana Martinez | Daily Utah Chronicle) Speaker Daud Mumin says they're tired and demand that justice be served at Washington Square Park on June 1, 2020. The people of Salt Lake City gathered again on June 1 to protest police brutality and the killings of black people across the country and in Utah. The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation Salt Lake and started at the corner of Washington Square Park. Protesters gathered around the park in masks to protect themselves against COVID-19, holding up signs which read “Black Lives Matter” and waiting to listen to the guest speakers. Moira Turner, a member of PSL and the designated spokesperson for the group, said that they were highlighting the voices of black people inside and outside of their organization and planned it to be peaceful. “Our goal as organizers and as people is to build resilient structures that combat racism over the long run,” Turner said. “We want to build these organizations of working class, oppressed and colonized people so that we can fight back over time.” At the protest, there were about a dozen civilians that designated themselves as medical help with red crosses taped onto their clothes. They were handing out water, masks and other equipment to protestors. The protest began with several speakers, the first being Daud Mumin. “Everyday we come out here, demanding that our people are treated as human, not as animals, to stand on our streets and be able to breathe, to not see our men and women being kneeled on,” Mumin said. “Today, I’m angry. Stop f—ing quoting MLK.” At one point he directly addressed Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Chief Mike Brown, calling them out for not being a part of the crowd that day and blocking off streets. “Black lives are not expendable. We are not negotiable. We’re not here to ask, we’re here to tell, and every single day we are going to continue speaking louder and louder,” Mumin said. Marvin Oliveros, with Justice for Cody, lost his brother Cody to police violence and spoke about the issues with police and the laws that he believes are problematic. He spoke about local law enforcement, specifically the Salt Lake Police Department harassing and stealing winter survival gear of unsheltered residents. Oliveros also highlighted legislation like H.B. 415, which “prohibits a municipality from establishing a board or committee with certain powers over a police chief.” Utah Against Police Brutality claims this bill came after it worked to create legislation for a police oversight board. During the speeches and chants, which were peaceful, an alert was sent out announcing there would be a weeklong curfew that would begin from 8 p.m. and last until 6 a.m. Amaal, another speaker who is a senior at the University of Utah studying history and is a member of the PSL, spoke about corruption in the system as a whole. “George Floyd and Breonna Taylor were not isolated events of a few bad cops. They were, rather, an example of an entire system rooted in the criminalization and death of black people in this country,” Amaal said. Deja Gaston, who moderated the speeches, also spoke on the reason PSL organized the event. “The deliberate devaluation of black lives, not just my life, but every person of color, is under the white supremacist capitalist state,” Gaston said. Protesters then walked from Washington Square Park through the City Library to the Salt Lake Police Department building, where they were met with officers surrounding the building. Protesters proceeded to chant, “No justice, no peace, no racist police,”“hands up, don’t shoot” and “stand up, fight back.” Thousands of people stood face to face with officers standing in front of the building, holding signs and chanting. At one point, a Salt Lake police officer, Metui Tautuaa, took a knee after demonstrators asked officers to kneel with them in solidarity. An action meant to symbolize a way to peacefully protest, it started back when quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat and later knelt during the national anthem before his team’s preseason games of 2016. When asked about why he decided to take a knee, Tautuaa said, “To keep them calm. We don’t want any violence. That’s the last thing we want to do.” The gesture was considered small by speaker Daud Mumin. Mumin said the act itself was performative. “That means nothing to me because you’re going to continue serving and protecting those that hold their interest. You’re going to be protecting and serving a very dangerous police force. I don’t have time to negotiate black lives,” Mumin said. “But what’s going to happen once [Officer Tautuaa] leaves the protest? Nothing.” Demonstrators then moved to the streets, blocking off 300 E 400 S. In front of them were armed police officers and military style tanks. As the 8 p.m. curfew approached, organizers encouraged people to head back to Washington Square Park and some made their way to the Capitol Building. Ten minutes away from curfew, the police standing face-to-face with remaining protestors said they were unsure how they would enforce the curfew, and it was not their call to make. When the time came, they moved protestors out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and then stood and watched protestors for around 30 more minutes. A protestor, who wanted to remain anonymous, spoke openly to them about not being allowed to access the steps of the capital at the protest on Saturday, May 30. “I see those steps as liberty. When I see police officers keeping me from accessing my capitol steps, I see that as a sign of oppression,” he said. Eventually, Lex Scott, the head of the Black Lives Matter Utah chapter, showed up with a megaphone and told them to go home and not get violent. She emphasized her efforts to get a police reform bill passed and she didn’t want them to mess up the work she had put in. A protestor threw a water bottle across the street towards police and rubber bullets were shot in response. The crowd at the street corner mostly dispersed at that point. Some crowds remained at the Capitol, but streets near the Salt Lake City public library and SLCPD building remained filled with armed police. Police were located all over the city, blocking major roads and standing on the roof of the City library. SLCPD reported on their twitter that 16 people were arrested, two being juveniles. Utah Highway Patrol arrested two people. We wanted to update our arrest numbers from last night related to the protest. We arrested 16 people two of which were juveniles, UHP arrested 2 people. The majority of arrests were for failure to disperse. — SLC Police Dept. (@slcpd) June 2, 2020 “The majority of people were arrested for failure to disperse,” the tweet said. “All across the world, America is on trial for the crimes they have committed against us. This is nothing short of a genocide,” Amaal said in her speech to protestors. “We ask the people of the global community to stand in solidarity with us, like we are doing with our brothers and sisters out in Minneapolis, fighting for their lives.” [email protected] @lanavanna [email protected] @natalie__news",0.0

LOGAN – A peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd came to Cache Valley on June 2. “We’ve been here since 10 o’clock this morning,” said Chris Rojas, the self-appointed leader of the thoroughly impromptu demonstration, “to show that we believe that black lives matter and we want everybody to know it.” A native of Oregon, Rojas now hails from Salt Lake City but has sentimental ties to Cache Valley. “I’m a sound designer,” Rojas explained. “I first came here back in 2008 to study theater at Utah State … Even with everything that’s been happening, I thought that this place might still be pretty quiet and that’s not good. “So I called some friends up here and told them to call some friends and here we are,” he added. The mixed crowd of locals and visitors were demonstrating their frustration over the death of George Floyd, an African-American who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. The arresting officer in that case, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with homicide. Graphic cellphone footage of Floyd’s death has sparked outrage across the county, including rioting over the past weekend in Salt Lake City and a peaceful protest in Ogden. The size of the gathering along Main Street in Logan ebbed and flowed throughout the day. The protesters displayed signs, some of them makeshift and others obviously pre-designed, calling for social justice and an end to violence. They encouraged passing motorists to honk and wave in support, which many did enthusiastically. At the gathering’s peak in late afternoon, about 50 protesters lined the street in front of the Historic County Courthouse. There were plenty of masks in evidence, but they were surgical style, not disguises. Despite espousing the themes of the Black Lives Matter movement, the crowd was mostly white, mostly young and universally good natured. “People have been great here,” said one of Rojas’ masked companions. “Nobody has given us any (trouble) … The Logan Chief of Police (Gary Jensen) even brought us pizza and drinks. “One jerk came by on a bicycle and asked if we were terrorists,” he added. “We told him ‘duh’.” The protesters also responded humorously to an occasional raised middle finger from passing motorists by flashing the peace sign and shouting of “We love you!” Rojas said that there could be more protests in store for Cache Valley in the near future. “I’ve heard that the real Black Lives Matter people down in Salt Lake are talking about coming up here on Saturday,” he advised. “That could be a little different.”",0.0

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems.

For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk in the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to reconsider fundamentally what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions. ... They have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high-quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the Indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new; it's just the intensity of it compared [with], let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

But as protests in Salt Lake City and around the country continue, a handful of bad actors make it difficult to distinguish between the message and the anarchy. Two men were arrested Monday night en route to the downtown protest with four firearms in their vehicle. West Valley police spokeswoman Roxeanne Vainuku said “we have every reason to believe” they intended to cause trouble. One can only imagine how their presence — and their potential actions — would have changed the outcome of an otherwise peaceful gathering. It is unfortunate how easily the violent acts of a few can drown out the just moves of the majority. The past week’s protests — including those in Salt Lake City — aim to demand justice for Floyd and accountability for law enforcement agencies in need of reform. Their message, that black lives too often suffer at the hands of injustice, is a rallying cry for reparation. But the violence, vandalism and theft that some perpetuate easily shift the public’s eye and the nation’s narrative from reform to restraint. That’s surely not the result Floyd’s family desires. Floyd’s younger brother, Terrence, has said as much, expressing concerns that the violent outbursts of a few are detrimental to the protests’ purpose. “I do feel like (the violence) is overshadowing what’s going on,” he said. “... The anger, damaging your hometown is not the way he’d want.” Or, as Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah lamented, “When they do violence, it comes back on Black Lives Matter … I just did eight hours of damage control for the last protest when I’ve been working for six years for police reform.” Making strides in the fight toward racial equality requires distinguishing between the message and the inflammation. Though the motives of the gun-carrying men stopped on Monday night are unknown, violence was undoubtedly not far from their minds. One of the suspects had posted on social media “multiple threats of violence against police,” according to Vainuku. More weapons were found and seized in his home. Their aims or political persuasions are irrelevant. Cruelty, hate, rage or contempt shouldn’t be permissible in society’s attempts for understanding and respect. It’s a danger to progress. Neither can we exclaim, as a few have, that all police forces are bad. Many, and we’d like to believe most, officers fulfill their duties nobly. The swift action of West Valley police and the FBI in apprehending these men “probably saved a lot of lives,” as Vainuku puts it. Still, that doesn’t excuse law enforcement, like other segments of society, from uncomfortable introspection, a determination to improve and, where necessary, a commitment to reform. As the nation continues its march toward a reckoning of racism, the task at hand is to separate a nonviolent — though at times justifiably angry — message from those who would rather see communities burn.",0.0

That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high-quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the Indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new; it's just the intensity of it compared [with], let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

It is also the latest in a disgracefully long list of black people, predominantly men, dying at the hands of police, those who are supposed to protect and serve. The incomprehensible killing of George Floyd prompted protests across the country — as it and other similar deaths, like the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, should. Some of those protests turned violent, as was the case Saturday in Salt Lake City, when protesters smashed windows and overturned and burned a police cruiser. Generally speaking, I don’t believe violence is an effective means of political expression. It drives away potential supporters, often harms disadvantaged neighborhoods, and shifts the focus from the issue that is the source of the outrage. Robert Gehrke  But we also can’t dismiss the legitimate anger, particularly among black Americans, when every other effort has failed to stop the killing. And we should recognize and praise those who tried to keep the peace, like when Kenny Akers stood in front of a 7-Eleven that had had its windows smashed out, the panicked clerk in tears in the door. “Listen to me as a black man. This isn’t the answer,” he implored. “This isn’t it. This isn’t how we do it. Protest all you want. Protest all you want. Violence is not going to get us nowhere.” Or Utah Black Lives Matter President Lex Scott, who was shown on video trying to stop a group from throwing rocks during Monday night’s protest, demanding things remain peaceful. But perhaps no image was more powerful than the footage of a Salt Lake City police officer kneeling with protesters. “I understand why they’re protesting,” that officer told FOX 13 afterward, saying he supports their cause. “We don’t want any violence. That’s the last thing we want to do. … We want to keep everything peaceful and if that means me taking a knee to make sure things stay peaceful, that’s what I”ll do.” Article continues below We saw similar scenes in several cities across the country. Some, I’m sure, will see the officer’s gesture as an act of weakness. But it’s the kind of courage we need right now — the courage to empathize and understand. We’ve all seen the Martin Luther King quote in the past week: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” The remedy, then, is for the very legitimate grievances to be heard, because if Utahns think George Floyd’s killing is simply a Minneapolis problem, we’re lying to ourselves. Despite some consequential efforts in the past few years to address some of the inequities, our justice system remains unjust for too many. The group Mapping Police Violence reported recently that, although black people make up about 1.4% of Utah’s population, they account for 10% of the state’s victims of police killings in the past seven years. Black and Latino people make up 30% of the population in jails and prisons, despite combining to make up just 15.6% of the state’s population. There are steps that policymakers can and should take urgently. Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, told me Tuesday he is working on bills to adopt recommendations from the NAACP — limiting dangerous chokeholds, creating uniform guidelines on conflict escalation and easing restrictions on the release of an officer’s misconduct and disciplinary history. “I was looking through what [the NAACP was] asking for and they’re asking for: Don’t do stuff that’s super-dangerous that is going to kill people,” Thatcher said. There are other measures that Black Lives Matter has been working on for some time. For example, every city should have a civilian review board with meaningful power to investigate and discipline officers, because when police police themselves, it’s impossible to have faith in the outcomes. Last year, the Legislature severely limited the authority of the review boards, a move in the wrong direction that should be reversed. Salt Lake City has been proactive on conflict de-escalation training and the deployment of body cameras, but more of both need to be done, including bias training, in departments statewide. One more: Our justice system should look like the population it serves, both those in uniform and in the courts. How is it that in Utah’s entire history there has only been one black district court judge? Beyond that, it’s time for policymakers to stop saying, “We understand your frustration and anger, but …” You don’t. I don’t. We can’t. We can’t comprehend that frustration because we haven’t lived it. Most of us in this state haven’t even lived near it. As I mentioned before, 1.4% of Utah’s population is black. When I was growing up, through elementary and junior high, I think I went to school with a total of six black people. I suspect the same is true for many, if not most, of our policymakers. Most of them grew up at a time when the predominant faith denied black members full standing in its ranks. But we’ve only seen real cultural shifts in this country when we can get past those differences and see one another as more alike than different. To get there, we need leaders (and people like me) to talk less and listen more and have the courage — like that police officer Monday — to empathize and be allies.

It was supposed to be an act of defiance: Mr. Trump has bristled at the observation that during the protests roiling the capital he has burrowed into a fortified bunker rather than addressing the nation. Like most performances arranged by Mr. Trump and associates, it made only a disjointed sort of sense. Yes, the president’s decision to march through the heart of the city’s unrest caused police and National Guard units to blast a peaceful crowd with tear gas and rubber bullets, carving a punishing path to the steps of St. John’s. But the show of force seemed to emphasize only that his legitimacy has shrunk to the point that he feels moved to dominate his own people with military power. As he took up his post before the church, which was partially boarded up after a minor fire that broke out during a recent protest, Mr. Trump set his face in a stony scowl and held up a black Bible, tightly closed. “Is it your Bible?” a reporter shouted. “It’s a Bible,” Mr. Trump said neutrally. The entire routine was vulgar, blunt: There Mr. Trump was, holding aloft this mute book — neither opened, cited, nor read from — in the shadow of a vandalized church, claiming the mantle of righteousness. After all, that was what he had come to do. A ruler maintaining order strictly by brute force has a problem. Such regimes are volatile and fragile, subject to eruptive dissolution. Mr. Trump may lack the experience or interest to even pantomime genuine Christian practice, but he has acute instincts when it comes to the symbolism of leadership. He seemed to know, as he positioned himself as the defender of the Christian faith, that he needed to imbue his presidency with some renewed moral purpose; Christianity was simply a convenient vein to tap. “I think that’s a standard trope in American political frames of reference,” Luke Bretherton told me on a Monday night phone call. Mr. Bretherton, who is a professor of moral and political theology at Duke University’s Divinity School, cited Cold War efforts to demonize socialism as viciously atheistic and amoral. It was work undertaken with anxious eagerness precisely because socialist criticisms of American life were substantial and compelling. So it goes with the protesters who have gathered to condemn the murder of George Floyd and the murders of others like him, black men and women slaughtered in America’s streets and in their homes by those entrusted with the force of its laws. Their moral case is clear, urgent, compelling. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Bretherton said, “there’s only one way to combat that symbolically: “To claim divine sanction for what amounts to a declaration of martial law.” Of course Mr. Trump is uninterested in the particularities of the Christian religion. St. John’s is a liberal Episcopal church, whose presiding bishop, Michael Curry, has vehemently condemned the stunt. (In a twist of bitter irony, the church’s sign posted behind Mr. Trump stated that “all are welcome.”) On Tuesday the president visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine, a holy space maintained by the Knights of Columbus, in honor of the pope whose blood resides in the shrine as a relic for veneration by the faithful. Mr. Trump is, of course, not Catholic; like the macabre parade in front of St. John’s, this is just an attempt at recruiting a vague Christian pastiche as the moral core of his authoritarian efforts. Christian leaders ought to condemn this blatant prostitution of the glory of God. Some, like Mr. Curry, will; others won’t, either because of their own political allegiances or fear of Mr. Trump’s wrath. But the most worrisome prospect is that it won’t matter at all what Christian leaders do; Mr. Trump doesn’t need them to stake his claim. “It’s significant that Trump did this alone,” Mr. Bretherton observed. Unlike prior presidents who sometimes appeared on grave occasions with priests or pastors, Mr. Trump “doesn’t need a Billy Graham figure to give divine sanction. He doesn’t need a priestly figure. He himself can be the mediator.” And yet it is still worth saying that the Christian faith does not condone the wanton destruction of human life or the presumption of God’s blessing by any earthly power. At the heart of the faith is servitude, not domination; Mr. Trump, hoisting the Bible aloft like a scepter, clearly has other plans. Article continues below In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus Christ is tempted by Satan three times, and the final temptation is this: dominion over “all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.” Christ rejected the offer, scripture holds; “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only Him,” he rebuked the Devil. But it wouldn’t have been a temptation if it weren’t in some way enticing. One imagines that Lucifer didn’t retire the gambit because of the one defeat and that in his years of similar propositions, he must have had many takers.

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops — waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases — after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday’s largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their Election Day,” Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump’s repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra’s argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

So it goes with the protesters who have gathered to condemn the murder of George Floyd and the murders of others like him, black men and women slaughtered in America’s streets and in their homes by those entrusted with the force of its laws. Their moral case is clear, urgent, compelling. In Mr. Trump’s eyes, Mr. Bretherton said, “there’s only one way to combat that symbolically: “To claim divine sanction for what amounts to a declaration of martial law.” Of course Mr. Trump is uninterested in the particularities of the Christian religion. St. John’s is a liberal Episcopal church, whose presiding bishop, Michael Curry, has vehemently condemned the stunt. (In a twist of bitter irony, the church’s sign posted behind Mr. Trump stated that “all are welcome.”) On Tuesday the president visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine, a holy space maintained by the Knights of Columbus, in honor of the pope whose blood resides in the shrine as a relic for veneration by the faithful. Mr. Trump is, of course, not Catholic; like the macabre parade in front of St. John’s, this is just an attempt at recruiting a vague Christian pastiche as the moral core of his authoritarian efforts. Christian leaders ought to condemn this blatant prostitution of the glory of God. Some, like Mr. Curry, will; others won’t, either because of their own political allegiances or fear of Mr. Trump’s wrath. But the most worrisome prospect is that it won’t matter at all what Christian leaders do; Mr. Trump doesn’t need them to stake his claim. “It’s significant that Trump did this alone,” Mr. Bretherton observed. Unlike prior presidents who sometimes appeared on grave occasions with priests or pastors, Mr. Trump “doesn’t need a Billy Graham figure to give divine sanction. He doesn’t need a priestly figure. He himself can be the mediator.” And yet it is still worth saying that the Christian faith does not condone the wanton destruction of human life or the presumption of God’s blessing by any earthly power. At the heart of the faith is servitude, not domination; Mr. Trump, hoisting the Bible aloft like a scepter, clearly has other plans. Article continues below In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus Christ is tempted by Satan three times, and the final temptation is this: dominion over “all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.” Christ rejected the offer, scripture holds; “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only Him,” he rebuked the Devil. But it wouldn’t have been a temptation if it weren’t in some way enticing. One imagines that Lucifer didn’t retire the gambit because of the one defeat and that in his years of similar propositions, he must have had many takers.

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.' "" On Wednesday, Francis says, he is joining the faithful in Minneapolis and across the U.S. ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican. Here's the full text of that portion of his remarks: ""I greet the English-speaking faithful joining us through the media. ""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that ""the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" ""Today I join the Church in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and in the entire United States, in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism. Let us pray for the consolation of their grieving families and friends and let us implore the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn. May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. ""May God bless all of you and your families. """,0.0
